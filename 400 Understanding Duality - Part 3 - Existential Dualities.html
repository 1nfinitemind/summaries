        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/D4izvIGPsXQ' target='_blank'>Understanding Duality - Part 3 - Existential Dualities</a></h1>
        <p><em>"In divinity, opposites are always reconciled." - Walter Miller Jr.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjective vs Objective</strong> : Leo delves into the intricate misunderstanding of subjectivity and objectivity. Subjectivity encompasses our experiences, and the common perception of an objective universe including scientific measurements is also a subjective construct. Quantum mechanics revelations, emphasizing the observer's impact on the observed, highlight the union of observer, instrument, and phenomenon – leading to a radical understanding of subject and object as inherently intertwined aspects of experience. </li>
<li><strong>Esoteric vs Exoteric Religion</strong> : Leo contrasts materialistic and externalized religion (exoteric) with its inner and more profound counterpart (esoteric), insisting on the interconnection between the two. He explains that esoteric insights form the core that gives rise to the external practices of religion, urging an open-minded exploration to truly comprehend spiritual teachings and uncover the essence of religious figures like Jesus, Buddha, or Muhammad. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysics vs Epistemology</strong> : The intimate relationship between being (metaphysics) and knowing (epistemology) is discussed, revealing that metaphysics is more fundamental. Leo suggests the act of knowing is deeply entangled with being, leading to the realization that to know something is to become it. This unveils the non-dual nature of existence, transcending the ordinary split between knowing and being into a unity where consciousness is both the observer and the observed. </li>
<li><strong>Chaos vs Order</strong> : Leo touches upon the interplay between chaos and order, explaining that they are inseparable and equally necessary. He introduces Chaos Theory, which brings forth the notion of inherent order within seemingly chaotic systems, challenging the notion of chaos as mere randomness and highlighting the intricate harmony of natural processes. </li>
<li><strong>Destruction vs Creation</strong> : The duality of destruction and creation is explored, rejecting the binary judgment of creation as good and destruction as bad. Leo discusses the necessity of destruction for new creation to take place, emphasizing the cyclical and interconnected nature of these processes in maintaining a harmonious balance in the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Circle of Life and Creation</strong> : The dynamic of destruction allowing for new creation is likened to tools that enable erasure and rework in art and technology. For example, an eraser on paper, or the 'undo' button in software like Adobe Photoshop. This feature reflects the necessity of destruction within the cycle of creation and how it ultimately leads to greater creations. </li>
<li><strong>Duality of Creation and Destruction</strong> : People often value creation but paradoxically despise destruction. Leo points out the hypocrisy in wanting to destroy destruction, highlighting that authentic creation (Creation with an uppercase 'C') encompasses both acts of creating and destroying. </li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Love</strong> : Love, as commonly perceived, is reduced to a lowercase 'l' love, which is selfish and conditional. In contrast, Leo describes God as absolute Love with an uppercase 'L', a quality that encapsulates all experiences and even what is conventionally seen as negative like hate or evil. </li>
<li><strong>Love as an Absolute</strong> : Transcending the duality of love vs. hate leads to the understanding that love is the very being of God and everything, even acts of hatred, are expressions of this all-encompassing love. Acknowledging this helps dissolve judgments and aligns with the realization that all is one. </li>
<li><strong>Alone vs. Together Duality</strong> : The feeling of being alone, even when with others, is rooted in the realization that all perceived others are extensions of the self. This sense of absolute aloneness underscores the non-duality belief that everything and everyone are parts of a singular, infinite being&mdash;that is, God or the Universe. </li>
<li><strong>Uniformity vs. Diversity</strong> : The apparent opposition between uniformity and diversity is reconciled in the concept of Diversity with an uppercase 'D'. This universal design ensures infinite diversity, reflecting the essence of God's nature to experience all forms of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Diversity</strong> : The universe, by design, seeks maximum diversity to allow God&mdash;the collective self&mdash;to experience every possible aspect of itself. This concept urges us to open our minds and hearts to the variety of life and understand love as encompassing all forms and expressions. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Love and Diversity</strong> : The concept of absolute love is equivalent to appreciating the complete diversity of life and humanity. Recognizing this diversity helps one to find peace and let others be themselves without the need for change, criticism, or violence. </li>
<li><strong>Diversity as a Pillar of Peace</strong> : Appreciating the diversity within oneself and others lays the foundation for peace, as it allows for acceptance without the urge to judge or alter others, which can prevent acts of violence, including murder. </li>
<li><strong>Dumb vs. Intelligent Duality</strong> : Intelligence is not the prerogative of the human mind but is an omnipresent attribute of the universe. Everything, even what is deemed 'dumb', is part of an infinitely intelligent design. </li>
<li><strong>Intelligence as an Absolute</strong> : The universe's design, even in its simplest forms or creatures, embodies perfect function, indicating that the concept of 'dumb' is relative and intelligence is an intrinsic quality of all existence. </li>
<li><strong>Freedom and Limitation Interplay</strong> : Freedom, taken to the maximal extreme, implicitly allows the creation of limitations. Absolute freedom can paradoxically result in the most powerful entities imposing restrictions on others, highlighting the interconnectedness of freedom and limitation. </li>
<li><strong>Freedom as an Absolute</strong> : True freedom, or freedom with a capital 'F', encompasses both infinite freedom and infinite limitation. This concept is central to understanding existence or 'God' as a state of infinite freedom, which includes every form of limitation. </li>
<li><strong>Part vs. Whole Duality</strong> : Everything in existence is both a part and a whole simultaneously. Recognizing this leads to an understanding that there is no true separation between parts and wholes – all are 'holons' contributing to a singular interconnected existence. </li>
<li><strong>Holism of Existence</strong> : Through the lens of non-duality, distinctions between part and whole dissolve, leading to the realization of 'Wholeness', where every element is both a distinct part and a facet of a singular, unified entity. </li>
<li><strong>One vs. Many Perception</strong> : The demarcation between one entity and many is subjective and depends on observation. Transcending this duality leads to the realization that oneness includes infinite 'manynesses', forming a unified whole. </li>
<li><strong>Mundanity and Divinity as Non-Opposites</strong> : Mystical experiences reveal the divinity in what is commonly perceived as mundane. The objective of spiritual practice is to sustain the perception of everything as divine, blurring the line between the mundane and the divine. </li>
<li><strong>Mundane vs. Divine</strong> : Upon progressing in spirituality, one discovers that the mundane and the divine are one and the same. You recognize that divinity permeates everyday life, and it's a matter of consciousness to see it. The divine is not a separate realm but is present here and now in all things. </li>
<li><strong>Imminent vs Transcendent God</strong> : The debate on whether God is within the world or beyond it is reconciled by realizing that God is both imminent and transcendent. This understanding eradicates the false dichotomy, revealing that everything is God, including all creation. </li>
<li><strong>Holiness Misconceptions</strong> : Orthodox religious views often mistake holiness for exclusivity from unholiness. Leo elucidates that true holiness (with a capital H) is absolute, seeing everything as holy, since everything is a creation of God. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious vs Unconscious</strong> : Warning against the misleading duality of conscious versus unconscious, Leo explains that true consciousness (with a capital C) encompasses everything and has no opposite. What we perceive as unconscious is merely consciousness acting in a certain way. </li>
<li><strong>Knowing vs Not Knowing</strong> : The dichotomy between knowing and not knowing collapses into the recognition of an infinite mystery. Knowledge becomes a conceptual framework that pales in comparison to the irreducible mystery present in being. </li>
<li><strong>Meaningless vs Meaningful</strong> : A paradox in spiritual discovery is that understanding the absolute meaninglessness of the universe allows one to consciously create personal meaning. The greatest meaning arises from understanding that fundamentally, all meaning is created by us. </li>
<li><strong>Life vs Death</strong> : Leo posits that life and death are intimately connected, highlighting that to sustain life, death occurs as a necessity. He argues that life at any scale involves death and this duality can be transcended to understand "Life" with a capital L, indicating a more profound notion of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of Death and Life</strong> : Death is an illusion and life, with a capital L, is omnipresent, transcending the duality between life and death. The universe is alive, thus even non-living molecules are part of life's omnipresence. This understanding prompts a reassessment of the origin of life in science. </li>
<li><strong>Mortality and Immortality as Dualities</strong> : Mortality is a misconception, as immortality with a capital I is the true nature of reality&mdash;without opposites. Realizing immortality is acknowledging one's eternal existence throughout all forms and formlessness. </li>
<li><strong>Real vs. Unreal Duality</strong> : The actual vs. unreal duality is a misconceived one. Recognizing that reality with a capital R has no opposite, leads to the understanding that everything, including myths like Santa Claus, has realness even if only as concepts or myths. </li>
<li><strong>Reality vs. Hallucination</strong> : Reality is synonymous with hallucination, as both are appearances without substance. The holistic perception of reality redefines everyday experiences and fantasies as indistinguishable, with both being forms of real experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Video Games and Reality</strong> : The distinction between reality and video games is unfounded; video games are also facets of reality. The future might see characters in games unable to discern if they are in a game or reality, similar to human perception of our existence. </li>
<li><strong>Being vs. Non-Being</strong> : Being is an absolute that encompasses all, including delusions and falsehoods. Every instance is being, making the duality of being and non-being invalid, with being existing across both actualities and potentialities. </li>
<li><strong>Actual vs. Potential Duality</strong> : The division between actual and potential or virtual is fallacious. God represents infinite potential, identical to infinite actualization; hence, everything potential becomes actual, and everything actual was once potential. </li>
<li><strong>Actual and Conceptual Reality</strong> : Concepts are also a form of actuality; thus, actual and conceptual are not separate but part of a unified reality. </li>
<li><strong>Self vs. World Duality</strong> : The self entity only exists due to the distinction made between the self and the non-self. Transcending this duality would result in a loss of ego and realizing oneself as everything, as God, leading to immortality, absolute existence, and infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Between Self and God</strong> : The divide between self and God collapses when one acknowledges that God is the world, and if the individual is also the world, then they are inherently God. This realization aligns with the collapse of dualities between the self, world, and others. </li>
<li><strong>God with a lowercase 'g' vs God with an uppercase 'G'</strong> : Leo distinguishes between two versions of God&mdash;'God' as commonly discussed by most religious people, which is a concept, belief, or image, and 'God' as the ultimate absolute, ungraspable through beliefs or stories. This ultimate 'God' encompasses everything, including self with a capital 'S', leading to the realization that self is God, thus transcending the duality of self and God. </li>
<li><strong>Selfish vs Selfless</strong> : The duality between selfishness and selflessness can be transcended, revealing that absolute selflessness (with a capital 'S') is equivalent to being the self with a capital 'S'. This state of total selflessness results in an understanding of the self as empty, nothingness, or absolute subjectivity, before individual identities, meaning one is simultaneously everything and nothing. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation vs Life</strong> : Initial meditation practices may seem dualistic, confined to dedicated time slots, but with deepening practice and experience, the duality between meditation and ordinary life dissolves. Meditation becomes an ongoing, background state integrated into all aspects of existence, leading to a life lived as one seamless, constant meditation in all actions and moments. </li>
<li><strong>Existence vs Non-existence</strong> : Leo explains that existence and non-existence are not true opposites. By realizing that everything, including falsehoods and delusions, are part of existence, the illusion of non-existence is lifted. This enables the understanding of immortality, where you cannot truly die because you are intrinsically part of the eternal existence that cannot be negated or destroyed. </li>
<li><strong>Truth vs Falsehood</strong> : The duality of truth and falsehood is transcended when realizing that absolute Truth (with a capital 'T') includes everything in existence. Falsehoods occur within the domain of Truth, meaning they are not outside of existence or 'unreal'; they are simply manifestations within the broader scope of Truth. Truth, synonymous with consciousness or awareness, has no opposite. </li>
<li><strong>Duality vs Non-duality</strong> : Leo acknowledges the inherent duality created when discussing non-duality, as language and thought are intrinsically dualistic. There are two versions of non-duality: one with a lowercase 'n', which is still a concept within dualistic thinking, and one with an uppercase 'N', which represents the absolute. The transcendent absolute cannot be communicated through language; it must be directly experienced. </li>
<li><strong>Relative vs Absolute</strong> : The duality between the relative and the absolute truths reflects different perspectives on reality. The absolute Truth is the ultimate realization and eclipses the relative when fully embraced. However, one should appreciate both views, not excluding the relative experiences and truths that shape our everyday life, while also being aware of the ultimate absolute. </li>
<li><strong>Division vs Unity</strong> : In the pursuit of unity, some advocate for unity that excludes those who prefer division, but true Unity with an uppercase 'U' embraces division as part of itself. This inclusive Unity understands the interconnectedness of all aspects of reality and integrates them without rejecting or dividing any part. </li>
<li><strong>Unity and Division</strong> : Leo discusses that true unity (with an uppercase U) involves accepting the inevitability of division as a necessary and inherent aspect of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Sanity vs Insanity</strong> : Leo challenges the sharp distinction between sanity and insanity, suggesting that the boundary between them is not clear and that they often blur into each other, with societal conventions shaping our perceptions of what is considered sane. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics revealing the truth</strong> : He discusses how psychedelics like LSD and mushrooms can blur the line between sanity and insanity, leading to a frightening but enlightening experience that forces an individual to face the shocking truth that undermines conventional beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Matter vs Spirit</strong> : Leo elucidates that what is commonly perceived as matter and spirit are not dichotomous. By transcending this dualism, one recognizes all phenomena as Spirit (with a capital S), which is the true nature of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Form vs Formlessness</strong> : Leo touches on the duality of form and formlessness and how deep awakening leads to the realization that they are identical, with form being formlessness and vice versa. </li>
<li><strong>Shiva and Shakti</strong> : He uses the Hindu concepts of Shiva (formlessness) and Shakti (form) to illustrate the nondual nature of reality, where both aspects are not just interconnected but fundamentally the same. </li>
<li><strong>Something vs Nothing and Zero vs Infinity</strong> : Leo explains that the dualities of something versus nothing, and zero versus infinity are fundamentally the same when transcended&mdash;each pair is identical at their absolute level. </li>
<li><strong>Finite vs Infinite and Limited vs Unlimited</strong> : These dualities are explored with the idea that true infinitude (with an uppercase I) includes all finite possibilities, and to be truly unlimited, one must also encompass limitations. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightened vs Unenlightened</strong> : Leo describes the transition from seeing enlightenment as distinct from unenlightenment to experiencing enlightenment (with an uppercase E) as an absolute state where the two are inseparable. </li>
<li><strong>God, Atheism, and The Devil</strong> : He articulates the non-duality between concepts of 'No God' and 'God', atheism and theism, and the devil and God&mdash;highlighting that they are all aspects of the same absolute reality, which encompasses all dualities. </li>
<li><strong>Polytheism vs. Monotheism</strong> : Leo discusses the misconception that polytheism and monotheism are opposing views. He clarifies that in true non-dual understanding, all gods within polytheism are unified under one absolute, formless Godhead, similar to concepts in Hinduism where multiple deities ultimately unify under Brahman. </li>
<li><strong>Temporal vs. Eternal</strong> : He differentiates between temporal and eternal, explaining that the present moment is actually eternal, existing outside of time. By understanding 'now' as eternal, one transcends the duality of temporality and eternality. </li>
<li><strong>Samsara vs. Nirvana</strong> : Leo addresses the Buddhist dualities of Samsara and Nirvana, emphasizing that they are not opposites but identical. Realizing Nirvana means recognizing it as ever-present rather than as a place of escape. </li>
<li><strong>Heaven vs. Hell</strong> : Leo speaks to the misconception that heaven and hell are dualistic opposites. He states that heaven is an absolute, omnipresent reality, whereas hell is a state created by the ego within the mind, even while one is in heaven. </li>
<li><strong>Final Thoughts on Dualities and Non-duality</strong> : In his conclusion, Leo underscores the radical, nuanced, and interdependent nature of dualities, highlighting that all phenomena labeled as reality are actually dualities. He stresses the importance of transcending the need to categorize reality into dualistic terms, something that is beyond language and thought. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Groundlessness of Reality</strong> : He shares the concept of the "groundless ground," which is the realization that reality is ultimately without an inherent ground, transcending all categorizations and dualities. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Communicating Non-Duality</strong> : He acknowledges that speaking about non-duality inherently turns the discussion dualistic and that contradictions and paradoxes are unavoidable in trying to express what is all-inclusive and infinite. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Maps and Models</strong> : Leo notes that all forms of formalization, including maps, models, and scientific equations, are finite attempts to describe an infinite reality. Therefore, they are useful but not comprehensive or absolute. </li>
<li><strong>Science and Finite Comprehension</strong> : He comments on the limitations of science in explaining reality, as it relies on finite theories and equations that cannot encapsulate the infinite. </li>
<li><strong>The Reality that Cannot be Defined</strong> : Leo reminds us that any attempt to define reality is limited because reality is everything and cannot be pinned down to a single characteristic. </li>
<li><strong>Admonition Against Dualistic Categories</strong> : He advises listeners not to be deceived by dualistic categories and claims of ultimate truth, emphasizing the importance of being skeptical and recognizing the impermanence of conceptual frameworks. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Categories in Navigation</strong> : Despite the limitations of categorization, Leo stresses that functionally created categories are necessary for effectively navigating life. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility to Not Mistake Partial Truths for Total Truths</strong> : He points out that it is vital to understand the difference between partial and total truths, recognizing the role of categories without treating them as absolutes. </li>
<li><strong>Skillful Navigation of Categories</strong> : Leo emphasizes the need for awareness and skill in navigating, constructing, and deconstructing categories. He advises that his critiques of science, categories, or ideologies aim to encourage going beyond them and acknowledges their partiality and temporariness. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of Absolutes</strong> : Leo reminds listeners that concepts like Truth, Consciousness, and Love, when capitalized, refer to absolutes, which are beyond relative ideas. He stresses that practices like meditation, self-inquiry, and psychedelics can lead to conscious awareness of these absolutes beyond dualistic descriptions. </li>
<li><strong>Unifying Absolutes</strong> : Addressing potential confusion about the number of absolutes, Leo explains that the Absolute is simultaneously one and many, like a diamond with multiple facets. This unity can't be fully grasped by examining each part in isolation or by dividing it into fragments. The unification process involves a comprehensive understanding of the whole. </li>
<li><strong>Blind Men and the Elephant Parable</strong> : Leo uses this parable to illustrate how different perspectives can describe aspects of a single whole, suggesting that various absolutes are facets of one entity and stressing the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of these aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Task of Unification</strong> : Leo urges individuals to take responsibility for societal and conceptual divisions they've created, encouraging a unification process that embraces all aspects of oneself, especially those one resists or hates. This process should maintain distinctions without falling into simplification or naivety. </li>
<li><strong>Exercise for Unification of Duality</strong> : Leo proposes an exercise where individuals must find a duality they have a preference for, acknowledge the interrelatedness of both sides, and consciously embrace both aspects as part of themselves, thereby broadening their understanding and transcending biases. </li>
<li><strong>Spiral Dynamics Stage Blue</strong> : Leo criticizes dogmatic religions that mistake beliefs in the absolute for the actual Absolute, leading to absolutist behavior and misunderstanding of evil. He highlights the importance of evolving beyond this stage to reduce the perpetuation of evil and societal collapse. </li>
<li><strong>Hyper Awareness of Dualities</strong> : Leo wants listeners to become highly aware of dualities in their thinking and to question and deconstruct categories as an intellectual exercise. This questioning should delve into the grounding of categories, revealing their foundation in nothingness, and recognizing how categories contain aspects of their opposites. </li>
<li><strong>Subjective Bias and Ideological Movements</strong> : People may have conflicting emotions towards ideologies like feminism, being ideologically against it while having a personal attraction to its contrary. It is crucial to recognize how these movements impact society positively, such as providing equal rights and protections for women. </li>
<li><strong>Perspective Shifting</strong> : Leo suggests contemplating how opposing sides of a duality could also possess positive qualities. If one views feminism negatively, they should consider its societal benefits, like advancing women's rights and legal protections, which could directly affect their own future offspring or themselves in another life. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional Attachment to Dualities</strong> : He encourages introspection to identify a personal emotional attachment to a particular side of a duality, highlighting that this clinging represents one's ego and delusion that must be worked through for true growth. </li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Dualities and Grounding Reality</strong> : Leo asks listeners to reflect on their most influential duality, whether it's self vs. world or matter vs. mind, and how they might be inaccurately grounding all of reality into this binary distinction. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Thought in Transcending Duality</strong> : He emphasizes that thought alone cannot transcend duality and access the absolute. Instead, thinking should be a starting point, leading to meditation, concentration, yoga, and psychedelics to access a deeper understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic Practice and Duality Contemplation</strong> : For psychedelic users, Leo recommends contemplating and focusing on a specific duality during trips. This practice can deepen understanding and provide a roadmap for future personal growth experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Understanding Dualities</strong> : Surmounting dualities is presented as a lifelong quest and the very reason for existence, to understand oneself as God. Leo warns against underestimating the depth of these topics and the need for direct experience beyond conceptual understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Skepticism and Empirical Verification</strong> : Leo urges listeners to not take his words at face value but to verify them through personal experiments and experiences, highlighting the empirical nature of his teachings on duality. </li>
<li><strong>Continuing Education and Community Interaction</strong> : He promotes his educational resources, such as his blog and online life purpose course, and encourages active participation in his forum for further learning and exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Dedication to Spiritual Development</strong> : Leo conveys that understanding duality and non-duality is not an easy or quick process but requires time, effort, and dedication, equivalent to building a massive skyscraper, and one should prepare for the investment it entails. </li>
<li><strong>Motivation for Profound Personal Growth</strong> : He motivates listeners to maintain their dedication, despite potential struggles, with the reminder that the journey aims towards profound goals such as omniscience, immortality, and total God realization. </li>
<li><strong>Overwhelm and Incremental Learning</strong> : Acknowledging the vastness of the subjects he covers, Leo advises newcomers to approach learning incrementally and be patient as the journey unfolds, emphasizing that there is always more to learn and discover.</li>
