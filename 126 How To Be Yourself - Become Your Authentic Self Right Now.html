            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/w1JzhhDMcpw' target='_blank'>How To Be Yourself - Become Your Authentic Self Right Now</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Struggle with Personal Authenticity</b>: Leo shares his struggle with being authentic and the constant challenge of not becoming a people pleaser, influenced by the fear of others' opinions. 
</li><li><b>Visualizing the Authentic Self</b>: He describes the authentic self as a shining beacon within, obscured by layers of social conditioning, negative beliefs, and limiting ideologies, which dim one's true essence and potential for success.
</li><li><b>Impact of Inauthenticity</b>: Living inauthentically hinders not only relationships and professional achievements but also personal fulfillment, as people are unable to express their true selves and be happy.
</li><li><b>Mental Image of Self Through Others' Eyes</b>: Leo talks about the problem of constantly envisioning oneself from a third–person perspective, which leads to an overly empathetic and stunted expression of one's identity.
</li><li><b>The Approval Addiction</b>: He explains the psychological dependency on external approval, likening it to a drug, and details how one compromises authenticity to gain compliments, love, or even tangible rewards like money and sex.
</li><li><b>External Validation vs. Inner Fulfillment</b>: Leo critiques the pursuit of external validation such as approval and material gains, explaining how these are falsely equated with true happiness and fulfillment, which are, in fact, internal.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Inauthentic Behavior</b>: He comments how even minor occurrences, like not confronting someone cutting in line, reflect a broader tendency to place others' opinions over one's authentic reactions out of a desire to avoid conflict or judgment.
</li><li><b>Realizing the Futility of External Pursuits</b>: Leo calls for a recognition that the pursuit of approval and material rewards won't lead to happiness or fulfillment, advocating instead for a journey towards self–expressive authenticity.
</li><li><b>Extension of Inauthenticity</b>: The act of not confronting someone who cuts in line reflects a broader philosophy of life where individuals lack assertiveness and confidence, often sacrificing their values and essentially their 'soul' for small gains like approval, love, or material rewards.
</li><li><b>Illusion of External Rewards</b>: Leo criticizes the mindset of valuing sex, love, money, and assistance above authentic self–expression, suggesting that the temporary satisfaction they offer is not worth the cost of sacrificing one's fulfillment and authentic self.
</li><li><b>Superficiality of External Validation</b>: He argues that seeking fulfillment from external validation, such as others' opinions, wealth, or approval, is misguided since these fails to lead to deep, lasting satisfaction; true happiness must come from within.
</li><li><b>Cost–Benefit Analysis of Authenticity</b>: Leo emphasizes that embracing one's authenticity comes with real costs but insists that the benefits of self–expression and fulfillment outweigh the risks of social debts and potential loss of relationships or jobs.
</li><li><b>Chances of Success through Authenticity</b>: Authenticity is portrayed as the path to success and fulfillment; while it may change social standings, it attracts genuine relationships and opportunities aligned with one's true self.
</li><li><b>Practical Exercise to Embrace Authenticity</b>: He advises making a list of life areas where being authentic could introduce conflict, confronting the potential costs, and deciding to prioritize authenticity over those costs.
</li><li><b>Self–Observation Without Judgment</b>: To transition toward authenticity, Leo recommends observing moments of inauthentic behavior–such as altering one's natural responses to please others–without self–criticism, as a form of mindfulness.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Be Authentic Despite Costs</b>: Concluding his advice, Leo urges viewers not to 'whore out' their authenticity for superficial gains and to trust that the intrinsic rewards of being oneself will lead to greater happiness and success.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org's Resources</b>: Leo advocates the resources available on Actualized.org to master one's psychology and achieve desired life results, highlighting exclusive content and the opportunity to win personal coaching sessions.
