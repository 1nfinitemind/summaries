            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/BEQTk75XFjU' target='_blank'>Grasping The Illusory Nature Of Thought</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Central question of 'What is a thought?'</b>: Leo emphasizes the critical nature of honestly inquiring into the essence of thoughts in our lives. If our conception of thoughts is misaligned with their true nature, it could be a source of unnecessary struggle and misinterpretation of life's events. Grasping what thoughts truly are goes beyond philosophical musings or dictionary definitions; it requires direct experiential understanding.
</li><li><b>Thoughts are real yet illusory</b>: Leo clarifies that he doesn't dismiss thoughts as unreal; instead, he wants to highlight their real but deceptive nature. Thoughts, while not tangible like a car or a tree, possess a chameleon–like quality–presenting themselves differently than what they inherently are, which can mislead us into attributing unnecessary depth or meaning.
</li><li><b>Picasso anecdote – illusion of images</b>: Leo recounts a tale about Picasso to illustrate the allure of images and the ease with which we can mistake representations for reality, such as confusing a photograph with the actual subject it depicts. This story emphasizes the necessity for critical awareness when engaging with representational forms, such as art, photographs, or symbols.
</li><li><b>Symbols' arbitrary nature</b>: Leo asserts the concept that symbols are fascinating due to their inherent arbitrariness–each stands for something it is not, and any object can potentially represent anything else. The significance of a symbol comes from the mind's power to map meanings, regardless of any resemblance to the symbolized object.
</li><li><b>Language as arbitrary symbols</b>: Leo explains that language, composed of arbitrary sounds, acquires meaning through the mind's interpretations. Without this context, language can appear as mere gibberish–an important insight when considering how meanings get constructed and applied to thoughts.
</li><li><b>Significance of understanding symbols for personal development</b>: Leo proposes that becoming aware of the arbitrary nature of meanings assigned by our minds is crucial to combating ill effects of misunderstanding thoughts and symbols. Understanding this can help us differentiate between the literal facts of a situation and the stories or meanings that we create around them.
</li><li><b>Mistaking symbols for reality</b>: Leo suggests that we often mistake symbols and the meanings they evoke for actual reality, which can lead to flawed decisions and perceptions–e.g., one might be misled by the image of a pizza into believing it can satiate hunger, demonstrating the potential dangers of confusing mental constructs with the real world.
</li><li><b>Analogy of a book</b>: To further drive home the point, Leo invites listeners to consider that a book is composed of mere black markings on white paper. The stories or information perceived come alive through the mind's interpretation, underscoring the importance of distinguishing between literal objects and the conceptual narratives we attach to them.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness of thoughts for self–actualization</b>: Through these examples, Leo aims to guide viewers toward realizing the significance of being mindful of thoughts, as a means to live a self–actualized life. Unraveling the inherent illusions in thoughts and symbols is presented as a path to true freedom and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Coping with negative emotions through understanding meaning</b>: Leo discusses that distress, suffering, and negative emotional reactions are largely related to the meanings we ascribe to events or situations, which are ultimately illusory. Being mindful about the nature of these meanings is key to self–improvement and reducing reactivity and distress.
</li><li><b>Introducing 'flattening the illusion' technique</b>: Leo introduces a technique he created called 'flattening the illusion,' aimed at distinguishing between the appearance of an object and its literal existence. He emphasizes that understanding the literal nature of things without the mind's emotional projections reduces the illusory impact they have.
</li><li><b>Training with visual examples</b>: To illustrate 'flattening the illusion,' Leo presents examples. First, he shows a two–dimensional image resembling a three–dimensional cube, challenging viewers to view it as merely flat markings on a surface. He also has viewers react to a potentially phobic image, encouraging them to differentiate their emotional reactions from the literal image.
</li><li><b>Real–world application of 'flattening the illusion'</b>: Leo emphasizes applying 'flattening the illusion' to one's thoughts, such as concepts of mother, gravity, and the external world. He urges viewers to see these concepts not as real physical forces but as sensations and ideas within the mind.
</li><li><b>'Flattening the illusion' of God and self</b>: The exercise progresses to more challenging concepts like God and the self. Leo encourages examining these thoughts literally, recognizing resistance to this process, and seeing them as mental constructions rather than external realities.
</li><li><b>Enhancing mindfulness through literal observation</b>: Leo draws an analogy between his technique and art instruction, where students are taught to draw what they literally see, not what they think is there. He advocates for this level of direct, literal observation in all aspects of life to understand the true nature of one's experiences and thoughts.
</li><li><b>The impact of meanings on emotions and life problems</b>: Leo explains that our emotions and life's problems stem from layers of meanings we assign to our thoughts and situations. Through his examples, he demonstrates that even deep–seated fears, anger, and depression can be deconstructed by addressing the meanings behind them.
</li><li><b>Practice to gain mastery over meaning assignment</b>: Leo stresses the importance of consistent practice in mastering how meanings are assigned, which is not acquired instantly but through persistent effort. Mastery over meaning can lead to the alleviation of fears, anger, and other negative emotions.
</li><li><b>Complexity of mental constructs</b>: Leo emphasizes the intricate web of meanings we create with our thoughts, which can become overwhelmingly complex. It may take consistent practice to unravel this web, but recognizing the potential in this exercise can be valuable for personal development.
</li><li><b>Mastering mental meanings</b>: By committing to the practice of deconstructing and flattening illusions in our thoughts, Leo suggests that over months or years one can gain mastery over their mind. This mastery could allow one to dissolve issues that one faces, essentially becoming adept at managing one's own internal narrative.
</li><li><b>Assignment to flatten illusions</b>: Leo challenges viewers to flatten 50 real–life thought illusions over the next week. Each flattened illusion should be recorded in a journal, breaking down thoughts into content and their literal components to differentiate meaning from factual occurrence.
</li><li><b>Three practical thought examples</b>: Leo provides examples of how to dissect and journal these thoughts: 
</li><li>1. <b>Hating the boss</b>: Divide the thought into emotional content (e.g., wishing the boss were fired) and the literal experience (e.g., imagining the boss's face, feeling physical tension).
</li><li>2. <b>Feeling shy in a crowd</b>: Separate the abstract self–judgment content (e.g., believing in one's inherent insecurity) from the actual physiological sensations (e.g., anxiety, mental imagery of appearing awkward).
</li><li>3. <b>Aspiring to be rich</b>: Distinguish the content (e.g., fantasizing about wealth and luxury objects) from what is literally occurring in the mind, such as visualizing bank balances and experiencing sensations of joy.
</li><li><b>Commitment and insights</b>: To successfully complete this task, viewers need to remain committed, setting reminders and carrying a journal to capture these thoughts accurately. This practice is expected to provide insights and begin to untangle deeply held beliefs and meanings.
</li><li><b>Importance of actual mindfulness practice</b>: Leo stresses that mindfulness should not just be an ideology but an actively practiced skill, akin to physical skills such as playing a musical instrument. There's a danger in believing one is already proficient without truly engaging in the mindfulness process.
</li><li><b>Resources for deepening mindfulness</b>: To further this practice, Leo recommends his own videos on mindfulness meditation and other topics that explore the mind's illusory nature. These resources can open a door to a broader understanding that leads to a self–actualized life, offering freedom from mind–imposed limitations.
</li><li><b>Invitation to continued learning</b>: Leo invites viewers to subscribe to his newsletter for ongoing content that will aid in mastering the mind. He promises that engaging with his material can lead to profound changes in perspective and achievement of personal goals that may have previously seemed out of reach.
