        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FgS4l1heQTc' target='_blank'>What Is Wisdom - The Ultimate Guide To Wisdom</a></h1>
        <p>"To become wise, study the consequences of fools"</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Wisdom</strong> : Leo highlights that wisdom is marked by keen discernment, good judgment, and having proper priorities. It distinguishes itself from mere information, knowledge, or academic smarts and is heavily oriented towards higher existential values. </li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of Wisdom</strong> : <ul>
<li>Wisdom involves being deliberative, thoughtful, and contemplative, with a strong orientation towards powerful questioning and self-reflection. </li>
<li>Wise individuals prioritize an existential dimension of life over lower values such as personal comfort and pleasure. </li>
<li>Wise people value and seek truth and exhibit a humility in their approach to knowledge, taking epistemology seriously and understanding the complexities of truly knowing something. </li>
<li>Open-mindedness is key to wisdom, especially in acknowledging the potential for self-deception. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Experience as a Teacher</strong> : Leo emphasizes that extensive, reflective experience is crucial for developing wisdom; it is through learning from life's challenges that wisdom grows. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom's Holistic Nature</strong> : Wise individuals hold a big-picture and holistic understanding of reality, which extends beyond specialized, narrow fields of knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Non-judgment, Long-term Thinking, and Paradoxes</strong> : <ul>
<li>Wisdom involves being non-judgmental and understanding the counter-intuitive nature of life. </li>
<li>It is characterized by long-term thinking and patience, rather than seeking immediate gratification. </li>
<li>Wise people have the mental flexibility and intuition to correct their mistakes and not repeat them. </li>
<li>They can handle paradoxes and contradictions without becoming confused or paralyzed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Objectivity and Healthy Skepticism</strong> : A wise person is objective, neutral, and able to identify and let go of personal biases, and approaches skepticism in a balanced, non-paranoid way. </li>
<li><strong>Integrity and Self-discipline</strong> : Wisdom encompasses living by self-derived principles with integrity, as well as practicing self-discipline out of an internal locus of control, rather than external enforcement. </li>
<li><strong>Developing Personal Wisdom</strong> : Leo underscores the importance of self-derived insights into wisdom through contemplation, as externally provided answers lack personal value until they are deeply considered by the individual. </li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation and Discipline</strong> : Wise people are motivated from within, valuing principles and internal satisfaction over external rewards like money or praise. </li>
<li><strong>Internal Locus of Control</strong> : The wise person takes personal responsibility for their life's events and problems, recognizing themselves as the primary agent. </li>
<li><strong>Confronting Emotional Labor</strong> : Instead of avoiding challenging emotional work, the wise face it head-on, doing what is necessary to live a good life. </li>
<li><strong>Craving Control</strong> : The wise are not slaves to their cravings but have the discipline to control them, preventing a life filled with suffering and regrets. </li>
<li><strong>Valuing Education to Avoid Mistakes</strong> : Wise individuals highly value education, learning from the history of human errors to circumvent repeating them. </li>
<li><strong>Exquisite Balance and Moderation</strong> : Wisdom enables the discernment of a delicate balancing point in various life aspects and maintains a dynamic approach to moderation. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Balance</strong> : True balance doesn't necessarily mean splitting every choice down the middle; wisdom understands when to take stronger stances in imbalanced situations. </li>
<li><strong>Maturity and Emotional Intelligence</strong> : Wisdom encompasses maturity and high emotional intelligence; It also accepts the ability to say, "I don't know," reflecting an understanding that admitting ignorance is a sign of intelligence. </li>
<li><strong>Admission of Wrongness</strong> : A wise person can promptly admit when they're wrong, correct their course, and genuinely apologize without seeking to save face. </li>
<li><strong>Forgiveness and Cautious Advice</strong> : Wise individuals can forgive and are careful with giving advice, aiming to guide people to find their own answers rather than imposing their solutions. </li>
<li><strong>Foolish Pursuit of Ease</strong> : Leo describes how seeking an easy life with minimal challenge paradoxically leads to a harder life, contrasting with facing challenges and responsibilities head-on, which can ultimately ease life's difficulties. </li>
<li><strong>Fool's Perspective on Truth</strong> : The fool perceives truth solely through the lens of personal gain, dismissing it if it doesn't provide immediate pleasure or comfort, and often conflates ideological dogmas with truth. </li>
<li><strong>Fool's Disregard for Existential Questions</strong> : Fools consider existential questioning and philosophy as useless or mere mental gymnastics, lacking in practical utility, thus demonstrating their ignorance toward deeper insights. </li>
<li><strong>The Problem of Self-Deception</strong> : Fools are oblivious to their own capacity for deception; instead, they externalize deceit as coming from others, making them susceptible to conspiracy theories and self-deception due to a lack of introspection. </li>
<li><strong>Fools' Misapplication of Skepticism</strong> : Rather than applying healthy skepticism to their own worldviews and introspection, fools wrongly direct skepticism toward perceived external adversaries, reinforcing their misguided beliefs and vulnerability to manipulation. </li>
<li><strong>Fool's Inexperience and Strong Opinions</strong> : Leo points out that fools frequently exhibit confidence in strong opinions on subjects they lack experience with, such as healthcare or economics, which leads to uninformed and possibly detrimental stances. </li>
<li><strong>Anti-Intellectualism Among Fools</strong> : Fools tend to have uninformed yet opinionated positions on complex issues like feminism or politics without comprehensive study or understanding, indicating superficial judgment. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom Perceived as Foolishness by Fools</strong> : When fools encounter wisdom or channels like Actualized.org, they dismiss the content as foolish and a waste of time, embedded in their prideful commitment to their own foolishness. </li>
<li><strong>The Folly of Egotism and Conformism</strong> : Fools exhibit egotism and a herd mentality, adhering to cultural beliefs without question and even when questioning, they do so in a toxic and distorted manner, often falling into conformity through outlandish conspiracy theories. </li>
<li><strong>Marketers and Politicians Target Fools</strong> : Leo asserts that large sectors of society, notably advertising and politics, prey upon fools by manipulating them for profit and power due to their predisposition towards immediate gratification and shortcuts. </li>
<li><strong>The Burden of Wisdom in Tolerating Fools</strong> : Wise individuals have to learn to tolerate fools in multiple facets of life, considering it a wisdom challenge to remain unshaken and centered in the presence of such folly. </li>
<li><strong>Attraction to Money and Pleasure</strong> : Fools are driven by the pursuit of money, sex, and pleasure, often behaving with a lack of discipline and a propensity to shirk responsibilities. </li>
<li><strong>Avoidance of Responsibility</strong> : A fool's degree of wisdom can be measured inversely by their reluctance to take responsibility; by not acknowledging their role in recurring problems, they externalize blame and believe themselves cursed or victimized. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Bias and Externalization</strong> : Fools have a tendency to be self-biased, failing to see how external problems are reflections of internal issues due to a conviction that they already possess all knowledge and are inherently the 'good guy.' </li>
<li><strong>Entitlement and Lack of Governmental Understanding</strong> : Fools often feel entitled, expecting mechanisms like good government to exist without understanding the need for conscious citizen participation to create and maintain it. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of Balance and Flexibility</strong> : Fools lack balance and moderation, swinging toward ideological extremes or dogmatic beliefs, because they do not understand that balance is dynamic and requires constant reassessment and adaptation. </li>
<li><strong>Unwillingness to Adapt or Apologize</strong> : Stubborn in maintaining their beliefs and rules, fools double down on mistakes, fail to learn from them, and have difficulty offering genuine apologies for their errors. </li>
<li><strong>Short Attention Span</strong> : Fools are easily distracted by trivial matters, losing sight of important existential concerns, and failing to invest in their long-term personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Seeking Shortcuts and Avoiding Emotional Labor</strong> : Fools look for instant solutions and avoid emotional labor, which ultimately leads to hardship as they refuse to prepare adequately for future challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Inability to Admit Ignorance</strong> : Fools are unable to acknowledge their lack of knowledge on various topics, often claiming expertise where they have none, and are prone to holding grudges and not letting go of past issues. </li>
<li><strong>Blabbermouthing and Unsolicited Advice</strong> : Fools engage in excessive talking without thinking, eager to share uninformed opinions as if they were facts, and often give unsolicited, absolute advice without considering individual contexts and needs. </li>
<li><strong>Rationalizations and Justifications</strong> : Fools make excuses and rationalize their actions, constructing self-deceptive narratives without realizing how these skew their reality and reinforce their biases. </li>
<li><strong>Hyper-Rationality as Foolishness</strong> : Overemphasis on rationality can become a trap, limiting one's ability to develop wisdom, which requires a balance between analysis, intuition, and emotional awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Tier 1 Cognition</strong> : According to spiral dynamics, tier 1 cognition, encompassing stages like red through green, represents varying degrees of foolishness, with higher stages gradually approaching wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Trumpism and Foolish Leadership</strong> : Trump supporters are characterized as fools who are unable to see the flawed leadership and negative consequences, often falling for conspiracy theories and exhibiting judgmental and scapegoating behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Religious Dogmatism</strong> : Foolish individuals often misinterpret and rigidify the deep wisdom found in religious traditions, turning them into inflexible dogmas without personal contemplation or implementation. </li>
<li><strong>Industry Exploitation</strong> : Fools are targeted by industries like sports, which thrive on tribalistic behavior to extract money from fanatical supporters, despite sports themselves not inherently denoting foolishness. </li>
<li><strong>Foolish Behavior Examples</strong> : Gambling, smoking, hedonism, avoiding condoms, tabloid obsession, junk media consumption, get-rich-quick schemes, and cheating are behaviors indicative of a fool's shortsighted and reckless approach to life. </li>
<li><strong>Types of Fools - Uneducated and Educated</strong> : Leo describes two types of fools: (1) the "uneducated rube," who lacks formal education and clings to simple beliefs or ideologies and is often born into circumstances without educational opportunities, and (2) the "educated shrewd materialists," who, despite being knowledgeable and successful in areas like business or technology, lack existential wisdom and prioritize materialism over deeper values. </li>
<li><strong>The Folly of Anti-Intellectualism</strong> : Anti-intellectual sentiments, often found in certain right-wing and conservative groups, reject and demonize education, which ironically could be a solution to foolishness. Leo criticizes this outlook for being counterproductive and imperiling wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Material Success vs. Wisdom</strong> : Leo warns against confusing material success and academic accolades with wisdom. He asserts that successful professionals and CEOs may be disconnected from existential truths, leading to a dangerous imbalance where technological power surpasses societal wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>The Scale of Wisdom and Foolishness</strong> : Wisdom exists on a spectrum rather than binary, where an individual's level of wisdom can be relative to others. For instance, a well-educated person may seem wise compared to a dropout but lack the depth of historical wise figures. </li>
<li><strong>Historical Wise Individuals and Ultimate Wisdom</strong> : Leo cites Greek philosophers, spiritual leaders, historical political figures, and certain scientists as paragons of wisdom. He posits that the highest wisdom is selflessness and infinite love, equating to God or the essence of the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Practices for Developing Wisdom</strong> : To cultivate wisdom, Leo recommends consciousness work, self-reflection, contemplation, questioning, valuing wisdom, studying both wisdom and foolishness, self-education, lifelong learning, maintaining a breadth of experiences, practicing non-judgmental observation, and exploring diverse perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Rewards of Wisdom and the Importance of Philosophical Existentialism</strong> : Wisdom leads to fulfilling life, peace, and sound decision-making. Leo emphasizes that those who misunderstand the existential dimension of wisdom tend to struggle with finding peace and happiness, underscoring the importance of aligning actions with higher existential values. </li>
<li><strong>Promotion and Application of Wisdom</strong> : Leo calls for the active development of wisdom through self-education and the embodiment and implementation of wisdom in one's life, with the mention of actualized.org as a resource for learning to live wisely and recognizing wisdom as the best life investment. </li>
<li><strong>Resonance with Wisdom</strong> : Feeling positive and warm when discussing wisdom indicates an innate love for it, turning one into a philosopher interested in both studying and embodying wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Pursuit</strong> : Philosophy involves not just reading about wisdom, but also deeply contemplating reality, asking questions, and developing a self-derived understanding that connects with existential truth, consciousness, love, and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Contemplating Wisdom</strong> : Realizing what wisdom truly means and contemplating it independently is crucial, as this personal derivation leads to a solid, intuitive grasp of wisdom which then can be used as a tool for making decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Application of Wisdom</strong> : Once an understanding of wisdom is established, it can guide in making wise choices in various situations by introspectively asking if actions align with wisdom or if they exhibit foolishness. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Bootstrapping of Wisdom</strong> : The process of growing in wisdom is empowering as it cultivates self-reliance, reducing the need for external books or advice, and making one's own introspection the primary source of answers. </li>
<li><strong>Intention and Pursuit of Wisdom</strong> : Setting an intention to be wise and maintaining it diligently over time, using resources like books, podcasts, and self-contemplation, helps in growing one's wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a Resource</strong> : Describing his website, actualized.org, as a wisdom school, Leo underscores the breadth of the site's approach to wisdom, encompassing politics, economics, relationships, health, and society, urging the audience to embrace wisdom in all life aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Patience in Wisdom Cultivation</strong> : Developing wisdom is a long-term endeavor that requires patience and persistence, treated as a lifelong hobby that improves with consistent, daily effort and various reflective practices.</li>
