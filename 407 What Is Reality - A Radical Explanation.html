        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jmBQRb5iuMg' target='_blank'>What Is Reality - A Radical Explanation</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Infinite Consciousness"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inquiring the nature of reality</strong> : Reality is described as infinite consciousness and infinite imagination. Physical reality, as perceived traditionally, is considered an assumption. Leo Gura contends that when we are born with no knowledge, we quickly learn and simultaneously misunderstand reality. Challenging long-held assumptions is stressed as they run deep in the subconscious. </li>
<li><strong>Physical reality as an impossibility</strong> : Leo emphasizes that physical objects are intrinsically impossible without consciousness. The existence of objects such as rocks, trees, cars, and the universe itself is not separate from consciousness. Moreover, the idea of being born, the Big Bang, and the progression of time are seen as imagined constructs. </li>
<li><strong>Present moment as the pinnacle of consciousness</strong> : The current moment and everything within&mdash;including one's body, emotions, and memories&mdash;are examples of consciousness in action. These aspects are not separate, physical entities but exist within consciousness as infinite imagination. The self is equivalent to this consciousness, further described as God, not in a traditional religious sense but as infinite imagination itself. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge in accepting reality as imagination</strong> : There exists a resistance to accepting that reality is imagined, and this resistance itself is suggested to be an aspect of imagination, reinforcing the idea that individuals are continuously creating their universe unknowingly. </li>
<li><strong>Grasping the concept of infinite consciousness</strong> : Understanding reality as pure imagination is not a semantic trick but a radical shift in perception. Leo discusses how this exploration may lead to a profound shift in understanding oneself and reality, possibly resulting in an 'enlightenment' or a mental breakdown, similar to a 'psychotic break.' </li>
<li><strong>Reality as a Hallucination</strong> : Leo Gura posits that reality and imagination are indistinguishable, equating deep insights into reality with experiences often deemed 'psychotic.' These realizations, while unsettling, are signs of awakening to the true nature of consciousness&mdash;as the sole creator of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Existence and non-existence within consciousness</strong> : Every concept, including death and non-existence, exists within consciousness. Leo rejects the conventional belief in an external reality and stresses that any experience or phenomenon is a product of consciousness, including the individual's understanding of life and death. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic experiences as consciousness expanders</strong> : Psychedelics are mentioned as tools for dismantling the perceived barriers between reality and imagination, potentially leading to an expanded state of consciousness. However, caution is advised due to the intensity of the effects, which can unravel one&rsquo;s sense of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing the awakening to radical reality</strong> : The realization of these radical truths is acknowledged as difficult, potentially destructive to current worldviews. Acceptance can result in a profound understanding of our role as creators and the true nature of our existence. </li>
<li><strong>Using hallucinogens to transcend reality boundaries</strong> : Leo Gura mentions LSD as a means to experience a state where reality and imagination merge, and objects become extensions of one's imagination. He advises against using highly potent hallucinogens like datura due to their disorienting and dangerous effects. </li>
<li><strong>Core teachings derived from Leo's experiences</strong> : Two principal teachings emerge - acknowledging oneself as God and recognizing everything as imaginary. The infinite and loving nature of consciousness is highlighted, though not deeply elaborated upon in this discussion. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of teachings as the main objective</strong> : Individuals are encouraged to actualize the knowledge that they are part of God, the collective consciousness. Acceptance and proactive realization of this teaching are vital as opposed to passively considering it as belief. </li>
<li><strong>The challenging pursuit of truth</strong> : The truth is described as radical and disruptive, with the potential to overturn grounded life views. Realizing the imaginary nature of all concepts aligns one with an eternal, infinite present, referred to as 'paradise,' offering peace and love. </li>
<li><strong>Future direction of teachings</strong> : Leo Gura signals that the theme of everything being imaginary will shape his future teachings, challenging many spiritual misconceptions. Understanding these radical concepts is crucial, and revisiting the topic is advised to address doubts and objections. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations as Imagined Constructs</strong> : Leo explains that the perceived limitations within the physical world, such as the inability to jump and land on the moon, are imagined constraints within consciousness. In reality, pure imagination has no limits because of oneness and non-duality, meaning that all boundaries between objects are also imaginary. </li>
<li><strong>Oneness and Infinite Reality</strong> : He asserts that because everything is fundamentally one and interconnected, there can be nothing outside of reality to limit or define it. Reality, therefore, must be unlimited in all aspects&mdash;not just spatially, but in all conceivable ways. </li>
<li><strong>Manifestation of Desires and Impossibilities</strong> : Leo emphasizes that reality, being infinitely intelligent and omnipotent, can manifest anything it wants immediately, and concepts of possibility and impossibility are actually figments of imagination. Even the distinctions we make between the real and the imaginary, or between what is possible and impossible, are imagined. </li>
<li><strong>The Building Blocks of Reality</strong> : According to Leo, reality is not made of physical matter like molecules or atoms, nor is it a digital simulation made of bits or information. Instead, reality is comprised of differences&mdash;the fundamental unit from which all elements of our perceived reality are constructed. </li>
<li><strong>Imagination Beyond Conventional Understanding</strong> : Leo challenges the conventional view of imagination, stating it's not limited to mental images and thoughts. He broadens the definition to include the physical reality around us, such as our hands, insisting that even these are imaginary. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Imagination Through Elevated Consciousness</strong> : He clarifies that comprehending the imaginary nature of physical reality requires a significantly heightened level of consciousness. Under ordinary consciousness, physical objects do not seem imaginary, but as one's consciousness expands, it becomes clear that all of physical reality is indeed a product of imagination. </li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Sophistication of Imagination</strong> : Leo describes imagination as a nuanced and layered process responsible for creating all of physical reality. He cautions against oversimplifying his teachings, emphasizing that understanding the full depth of imagination's role in shaping reality requires considerable effort and openness to radical ideas. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Imagined Existence and the Struggle of Acceptance</strong> : He uses the metaphor of a 'slope of reality' to illustrate how individuals build their existence from birth, imagining their physical, psychological, and biological selves. Leo indicates that this steep slope of reality becomes a treacherous path as one begins to question the very fabric of their imagined reality, facing the fear of existential annihilation. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to Radical Ideas Due to Attachment</strong> : Leo highlights that most individuals do not deeply question their existence due to fear and attachment to the life and worldview they have created. This fear serves as validation of the imaginary nature of reality but encountering it can be alarming and lead to what some might call a psychotic breakdown. </li>
<li><strong>Inability to distinguish reality</strong> : Leo discusses how deep questioning of reality can lead to an inability to distinguish what is real from fantasy, to the extent of not knowing if one's hand is real or if one's mother is a separate person. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of self-invention</strong> : He explains that through questioning, one may come to realize that they have been eternally imagining their existence, including their childhood and parents, right at this moment. </li>
<li><strong>Denial as a product of imagination</strong> : Leo suggests that all denials, including the disbelief that memories and parents are imaginary, are themselves products of one's imagination. </li>
<li><strong>Limits of imagination caused by imagination itself</strong> : He posits that people cannot imagine a new world because they are preoccupied with imagining the current one. Stopping this process would equate to death, which is also imagined. </li>
<li><strong>Layers of imagination</strong> : He clarifies that imagination has layers, and the more profound subconscious layers create our perception of the physical world, obstructing our ability to imagine at will. </li>
<li><strong>Imaginary and real as a product of imagination</strong> : Leo emphasizes that once something is imagined, it becomes the individual's reality. This includes imagining oneself in a room on a planet in a universe at a particular time. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite consciousness as the crux of reality</strong> : Leo concludes that realizing the imaginary nature of reality can be very radical, leading to what could be perceived as a psychotic breakdown due to the inability to distinguish reality from imagination. This leads to the dark night of the soul, a reevaluation of one's entire life, and the understanding that existence is an eternal act of imagination. </li>
<li><strong>LSD Experiences and the Boundary of Imagination</strong> : Leo discusses how high doses of LSD can cause reality to blend with imagination, leading to visual modifications like seeing eyes on one's fingertips or envisioning a car as a goat. This is due to an elevation in consciousness where the distinction between reality and imagination dissolves, allowing what is imagined to begin manifesting as reality. </li>
<li><strong>Danger of Potent Hallucinogens</strong> : He warns of the dangers of extremely potent psychedelics, like datura, which can cause indistinguishable hallucinations from reality. This is as contrasted with more manageable substances like LSD, where the user typically retains awareness that they're under the influence. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Highest Teachings on Reality</strong> : Leo presents his two highest teachings derived from extensive study and experimentation: 1) You are God, nothing exists but God, and you are alone; and 2) Everything is imaginary. He emphasizes that these concepts should be actualized, not merely held as beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Struggling with the Radical Truth</strong> : He observes that people avoid the truth due to its radical nature, which can threaten their life's narrative. Accepting these radical ideas can lead to an understanding of existence as an eternal present moment, which he equates with 'paradise'. </li>
<li><strong>Foreseeing a Shift in Teachings</strong> : Leo intimates that his future teachings will focus on the notion that everything is imaginary, a transformative idea that traverses much of spiritual misconceptions. He encourages the audience to revisit his points, understanding that doubts and objections are also products of imagination.</li>
