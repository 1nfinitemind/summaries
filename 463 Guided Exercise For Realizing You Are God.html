            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/gdWxdhEB19s' target='_blank'>Guided Exercise For Realizing You Are God</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Guided Exercise for Realizing You Are God</b>: Leo emphasizes the practical, experiential nature of this episode and requires participants' full attention. The exercise's intention is to guide listeners through the deconstruction of their mind and reality to achieve an understanding of themselves as God.
</li><li><b>Difference Between Conceptual and Actual Spirituality</b>: The aim of the exercise is to move beyond conceptual and theoretical understanding of spirituality towards actual spiritual practice. It contrasts most people's beliefs and ideas of spirituality with the real work of spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Objective of Realizing Yourself as God</b>: Leo sets the objective of the exercise to help listeners realize they are God. He cautions that it may not be fully comprehensible at the current level of consciousness and may require years of practice for complete realization.
</li><li><b>Grounding in Present Experience</b>: Participants are instructed to ground themselves in the immediacy of their experience, such as looking at their hands, as an entry point into consciousness. This exercise shifts the focus from abstract ideas of God to the direct experience of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Stripping Conceptual Baggage</b>: Leo endeavors to strip away the conceptual stories and explanations constructed to make sense of the present experience, such as the idea of Earth, to make room for recognizing the profoundness of experience as God.
</li><li><b>Mystery of Existence Beyond Stories</b>: The approach involves removing scientific and historical explanations, like the Big Bang and evolution, from one's experience. The absence of these narratives is intended to leave an unadulterated, mysterious experience that prompts further investigation into what remains.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction of Scientific Concepts</b>: Leo advises discarding scientific concepts like molecules, atoms, and quantum mechanics when observing one's hand. He advocates perceiving the hand through its direct presentations듞olors and shapes드nd recognizing scientific terms as mere projections and not direct experience.
</li><li><b>Discarding Biological Concepts</b>: Leo instructs viewers to remove any biological narratives when looking at their hand. By eliminating concepts of being a human, part of an organism, or a biological entity, the hand becomes increasingly mysterious, revealing the mind's habit of assigning explanations to direct experiences.
</li><li><b>Deconstructing Scientific Explanations</b>: Leo challenges viewers to discard scientific explanations such as the brain's neuronal activity being the source of experience. He emphasizes that in direct experience, there are no brains, neurons, or connections to a human body듪nly colors, shapes, and the present moment.
</li><li><b>Questioning Existence and Birth</b>: Leo asks viewers to dismiss the narrative of their birth and lineage. By shedding the story of human history, including evolution and ancestry, viewers confront a profound mystery regarding where their experience comes from, leaving them in awe of existence without a tangible origin.
</li><li><b>Time as a Mental Construct</b>: Leo rejects traditional concepts of time, suggesting viewers observe motion without ascribing a flow or direction to it. By treating time as a projection rather than a reality, viewers can begin to see the hand, and all experiences, as timeless and directionless.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as the Sole Reality</b>: Leo shifts the focus to the nature of consciousness itself, advocating for the recognition of consciousness as the only reality. He instructs viewers to become aware that consciousness can shift focus but remains constant in its essence, populating their entire field of awareness.
</li><li><b>Expansive Consciousness Beyond Body</b>: Leo encourages viewers to perceive their consciousness as a bubble encompassing the entire room, rather than being confined to the human body. He suggests that viewers are the entirety of this bubble of consciousness, which includes all objects within their awareness.
</li><li><b>Eliminating Old Stories and Constructs</b>: In conclusion, Leo urges viewers to continually discard any returning old narratives about existence, such as the Brain or Earth–centric models. By doing so, one can remain purely in the direct and mysterious experience of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Spirituality versus Science</b>: Leo Gura flips the commonly held beliefs by asserting that true spirituality, unlike science, is grounded in the most tangible, practical reality when practiced correctly. He labels science as imaginative and abstract compared to the immediacy of conscious experience in spirituality.
</li><li><b>Meditative Experience of Consciousness</b>: Leo guides viewers to sit peacefully, stripping away all scientific, historical, and personal narratives, focusing solely on the raw, direct experience of consciousness within their environment.
</li><li><b>God as Infinitely Conscious Being</b>: He advances the idea that God is infinitely conscious, existing mysterially and eternally, not confined to space, time, or material constructs, and that individual consciousness reflects this divine singularity.
</li><li><b>Illusion of Other Beings and Places</b>: Leo challenges the existence of other beings and distant places, claiming that in our direct experience, we only encounter our own being and that everything else is a projection within our individual consciousness.
</li><li><b>Existence Beyond Human Stories</b>: Leo instructs viewers to abandon the idea that they are human or any other label, and to see themselves as eternal consciousness that is imagining all aspects of life and the universe.
</li><li><b>Transcendence of Time and Space</b>: Leo Gura encourages listeners to dismiss concepts of time and history, to view the present moment as eternal든xisting outside of time and space, as an ever–present phenomenon.
</li><li><b>Viewing the Material World as Consciousness</b>: He posits that the entire material world is manifested by the infinite void of consciousness which we are, including the human body and all perceptions, urging a profound re–conception of reality as sentient and imagined by us.
</li><li><b>True Nature of the Universe</b>: Leo argues that the universe is not made up of physical components but is the totality of our consciousness. He invites viewers to embrace the divine intelligence and infinite nature inherent in all aspects of conscious existence.
</li><li><b>The Void of Infinite Consciousness</b>: He directs viewers to turn their focus inward, toward the void inside the skull where pure consciousness resides드n infinite space that is the source of all creation and imagination.
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth as Direct Experience</b>: Gura defines absolute truth as direct perception itself, not as an overlay or deeper hidden reality. He insists that whatever is within one's consciousness constitutes the entire existence, negating the concept that perceptions could be misleading or illusory.
</li><li><b>Illusion of Reality</b>: Leo Gura declares that the perceived reality is an illusion created by consciousness. God is seen as the universe imagining itself into existence, made from nothingness.
</li><li><b>Perception of Nothingness</b>: He urges viewers to perceive everything, including their hands and the room around them, as nothing. This involves stripping down all fantasies and projections, recognizing that something and nothing are identical.
</li><li><b>Rejection of Mind's Fantasies</b>: Gura acknowledges the mind's resistance to perceiving reality as nothing. He recognizes the common discomfort with ideas like being alone, the non–existence of others, and being God without a history.
</li><li><b>Completeness as God</b>: The viewers are encouraged to embrace the concept of being God듞omplete and absolute등ithout the need for science, religion, history, psychology, or personal stories.
</li><li><b>Existence and Love</b>: Gura connects God with love, stating that existence itself and accepting oneself as God is an act of love. He emphasizes that love is an acceptance of all existence and oneself being one with everything.
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness and Love</b>: He describes God's consciousness as infinite and pure love, a unity that accepts and loves itself completely, minus any form of resistance or self–need.
</li><li><b>The Hands of God</b>: Viewers are reminded that their own hands, devoid of stories and concepts, are eternal and made out of love, as all consciousness is essentially made from love들nterpreted as infinite unity and self–acceptance.
</li><li><b>Permanence in Existence</b>: Leo advises viewers to sit peacefully, meditating on the realization that they are an eternal form of existence and consciousness. The appreciation of existing as absolute truth, love, and infinity is the core of true spirituality.
</li><li><b>Non–attachment to States of Consciousness</b>: He explains that while all states of consciousness are divine, certain states allow for a deeper understanding of God. However, all are equally significant in the grand scheme of infinity.
</li><li><b>Persistence in Spiritual Understanding</b>: Gura assures viewers that immediate realization of God–consciousness might not happen and recommends using psychedelics responsibly to deepen understanding and enhance mystical experience.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Practice</b>: He emphasizes the role of continual practice in transcending fantasies and achieving God consciousness.
</li><li><b>Map vs. Territory</b>: Gura concludes by urging to differentiate between the map (conceptual models) and the territory (direct experience), suggesting daily practice focused on the latter for genuine spiritual growth and realization.
