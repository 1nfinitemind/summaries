        <ul>
<li><strong>Reason for Insights Blog</strong> : Leo has many insights that don't fit into his extensive weekly video format, so he created the insights blog to share smaller, profound ideas on various topics like philosophy, epistemology, spirituality, and personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Frequency of Posts</strong> : Leo plans to post regularly on the blog, which will not replace but supplement his weekly video content, serving as an outlet for the numerous insights he accumulates. </li>
<li><strong>Blog's Unique Flexibility</strong> : The text format of the blog allows Leo to incorporate images and links more effectively, and the writing medium lets him craft his language with greater precision. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of Blog Content</strong> : Blog posts are intentionally short and "half-baked," aimed at sparking individual thought and self-inquiry, particularly beneficial for more experienced followers who don't require exhaustive explanations. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Blog</strong> : Leo intends to use the blog for sharing quick, thought-provoking insights, offering a space where he can be more speculative, philosophical, and abstract without the constraints of his practical video content. </li>
<li><strong>Exclusive and Philosophical Content</strong> : The blog is Leo's platform for discussing more philosophical and speculative topics, which he feels restricted from doing in his videos, offering exclusive content not available on other mediums. </li>
<li><strong>No Comment Section by Design</strong> : To keep the blog posts focused and free from the distraction of debates and criticism, Leo intentionally omitted a comments section, directing those discussions instead to the Actualized.org forum or video comments.</li>
