            <ul>
    <li><b>Self–Reflection on Anger</b>: Leo mentions that he has difficulty relating to anger on a deep emotional level because he rarely experiences full–out rage. He understands it logically but does not feel it as intensely as others might, which gives him a different perspective on the emotion of anger.
</li><li><b>Perception of Anger</b>: Leo views anger as a low consciousness state that reflects poor self–control. He finds it abhorrent when individuals lose control to anger, and he emphasizes that being frequently angry is a personal problem, not an issue with the world or other people.
</li><li><b>Anger as a Violation of Personal Standards</b>: Leo explains that anger is often triggered when someone else fails to meet our personal standards or violates our model of reality. These standards are subjective and unique to each person.
</li><li><b>Curiosity as a Response to Anger</b>: Suggesting practical advice, Leo encourages adopting curiosity when feeling angry. By trying to understand why another person might not meet your standards, your anger can transform into inquisitiveness, thus raising your level of consciousness and mitigating the emotion.
</li><li><b>Third–Person Observation Technique</b>: Another practical technique is to observe oneself while being angry as a third–party observer. This heightened state of consciousness tends to reduce the intensity of the anger as one becomes aware of their actions.
</li><li><b>Meditation for Anger Management</b>: Leo recommends daily meditation to raise consciousness, stay present, and create inner peace. Consistent meditation practice is suggested as a strategy to lessen the frequency and severity of anger outbursts.
</li><li><b>Root of Anger in Disowned Parts of Self</b>: Leo suggests that persistent anger is a sign of suppressed parts within oneself, often stemming from trauma. These disowned aspects are perceived when one observes others violating standards that the angry individual is also struggling to uphold.
</li><li><b>Projecting Anger Due to Self–Integrity Conflict</b>: When there's a conflict in maintaining self–imposed standards (e.g., honesty), individuals tend to project anger onto others, shifting the focus away from their own internal conflicts.
</li><li><b>Call to Action for Personal Development</b>: Concluding his talk, Leo urges viewers to sign up for his newsletter focused on emotional intelligence and self–mastery. He makes the case for understanding the psychology behind emotions and personal reactions as integral to creating a successful and fulfilling life.
