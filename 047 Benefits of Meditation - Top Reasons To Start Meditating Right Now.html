</li><li><b>Improved performance</b>: Regular practice of meditation can boost performance in various domains such as work, athletics, and relationships by fostering a calm and grounded state of being.
</li><li><b>Better decision–making</b>: Being in a relaxed state from meditation allows for better impulse control and decision–making, as it diminishes the influences of stress and negative emotions.

</li><li><b>Potential for enlightenment</b>: While a deep and long–term commitment is required, enlightenment is a state where ego dissolves and judgment, criticism, and emotional baggage disappear, allowing for profound peace and oneness with the universe.
</li><li><b>Increased happiness</b>: Meditation leads to happiness without dependence on external factors, teaching contentment in the present moment, releasing concerns about past and future.
</li><li><b>Meditation as therapy</b>: Consistent practice of meditation allows unresolved issues from the subconscious to surface, leading to the shedding of limiting beliefs, old notions, and ultimately personal transformation and growth.
</li><li><b>Ego evolution</b>: As meditation continues, the ego evolves to accommodate new ways of thinking, shedding outdated patterns and thoughts.
