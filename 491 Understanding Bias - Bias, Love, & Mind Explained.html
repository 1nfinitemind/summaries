        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/BKPun7oY2ZI' target='_blank'>Understanding Bias - Bias, Love, & Mind Explained</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Consciousness free of bias is infinite love."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational nature of bias</strong> : Leo characterizes the concept of bias as fundamental to understanding metaphysics, epistemology, human behavior, self-deception, consciousness, and epistemic error. He argues that without grasping bias, one cannot fully comprehend existence. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of bias</strong> : Bias is defined as a preference for one thing over another. Leo urges deep contemplation on why one part of reality deserves preference over another, a question that he believes can unravel the mysteries of life and reality. </li>
<li><strong>Existential role of bias</strong> : Leo discusses biases in the context of survival instincts and attachment to finite objects, which necessitates biases. He further explains that biases are relative, and dependent on what we, as humans, project onto the world. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning biases</strong> : He emphasizes the importance of questioning our biases instead of acting on them without awareness or critical thought. Examples used include preferences for room temperature and emotional attachments to objects like sports cars. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity and survival</strong> : Leo links the relativity of biases to survival, making the point that survival inputs value on certain aspects of reality over others, but this is subjective and informed by personal attachment and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Creation and persistence of biases</strong> : He explains how biases persist despite understanding their illogical nature, driven by our efforts to ensure the persistence of things we are attached to, like our identities and possessions. </li>
<li><strong>Biases affecting life decisions</strong> : Leo illustrates how biases influence fundamental life decisions and behavior, arguing that they stem from our survival mechanisms and that we often fail to question the validity or necessity of these biases. </li>
<li><strong>Survival attachments</strong> : He contends that survival attachments lead to the necessity for bias, where the desire for finite things to persist creates a skewed perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Profound Bias in Daily Life</strong> : Leo describes how biases affect every aspect of daily life, from personal relationships to professional settings, and even the YouTube videos one chooses to watch. He emphasizes the importance of continuous self-reflection to become keenly aware of how deeply ingrained these biases are. </li>
<li><strong>Taboo Topics Revealing Bias</strong> : Leo poses provocative questions about sexual attraction, using examples like a lack of sexual interest in a parent's genitalia or in bestiality, in order to highlight biases that society takes for granted. He challenges listeners to contemplate why certain things are considered obvious or taboo and to recognize these as biases rather than universal truths. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Questioning of Biases</strong> : Leo encourages listeners to engage in deep existential questioning about their biases. He suggests questioning the very reasons behind why humans find certain things appealing, why they follow social conventions, and why they are quick to label certain ideas as off-limits. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of Sex and Procreation Biases</strong> : He provocatively asks why one might have a bias toward human sexual partners over animals, and why procreation is considered important, questioning the cultural and biological reasons behind these preferences and suggesting they are not absolute truths but biases. </li>
<li><strong>Logic vs. Biases</strong> : Leo debunks the notion that understanding the irrationality of biases will lead to change in behavior. He argues that even when biases are logically deconstructed, humans will still act according to their biases because they are not fundamentally logical. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to Questioning Fundamental Biases</strong> : He discusses the human tendency to resist questioning deeply ingrained biases, especially those involving concepts like suffering and death, which are often deemed self-evidently bad and therefore beyond further inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Construal of Morality and Crime</strong> : Using the example of child sexual abuse, Leo points out that notions of what constitutes a crime or a moral transgression are culturally constructed, not universal truths. He cites historic examples to show the relativity of moral standards across different societies and time periods. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning the Ego's Role in Seeking Truth</strong> : Leo criticizes the notion that scientists can find truth detached from personal bias. He contends that without facing one's deepest biases, truth remains elusive, highlighting the importance of personal engagement in the pursuit of knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Biases That Come With Parenting</strong> : Leo explores the biases associated with parenting, questioning why parents consider their own children more deserving than others. He asks listeners to adopt a universal perspective and consider all children equal, positing that from the universe's standpoint, no child is more important than another. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Relativism of Children's Importance</strong> : He emphasizes that while every parent believes their child is special, the universe or a greater consciousness does not favor one child over another. He invites listeners to view their child as equally important as any other child in the world. </li>
<li><strong>Impartial Nature of Physical Laws</strong> : Gravity, a universal and impartial force, doesn't distinguish between a morally good or a bad child; it treats all objects equally without bias. </li>
<li><strong>Truth and Even-handedness</strong> : Leo illustrates the connection between truth and lack of bias. Without bias, there is even-handedness and equality; with bias comes inequality. </li>
<li><strong>Desire for Equality vs. Personal Bias for Inequality</strong> : People often have conflicting desires: they often want the best for their children (inequality) yet advocate for equality in society. </li>
<li><strong>Rationalizing Biases</strong> : Individual biases lead to rationalizing and justifying unequal treatment when it serves personal interests, yet one might object to inequality when it disadvantages them or their loved ones. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge of Truth-Seeking</strong> : Leo explains truth-seeking as difficult because it requires addressing biases attached to personal issues like family and survival, which are often protected from existential consequences in academic settings. </li>
<li><strong>Conflict Between Surviving and Seeking Truth</strong> : Parents may prioritize their children's survival opportunities (like choosing a better school) over a commitment to broader social equality and truth. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Inequality and Personal Bias</strong> : Leo points out that selfish biases, craving favorable inequality, lead to societal issues like racism and sexism. These biases result in a society that individuals may find unjust when they are adversely affected. </li>
<li><strong>Reflection on Corporations and Selfish Bias</strong> : Critiquing corporate and government actions, Leo notes that they operate on the same principles of self-serving bias as individuals, leading to societal dissatisfaction with perceived unfairness. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging Fundamental Assumptions</strong> : Ending the section, Leo prompts reflection on why society values order over chaos or peace over disorder, emphasizing the need to question these inherent biases in the pursuit of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Relative nature of preferences and biases</strong> : Leo challenges the perception that some preferences, such as being rich over being poor or freedom over slavery, are objectively better. He asserts these are biases influenced by survival instincts and are distortions in our cognitive processes. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of objectivity</strong> : Leo emphasizes that what people often consider as objective truths, such as the superiority of freedom over slavery, are actually subjective biases. He highlights that true objectivity would not distinguish between such concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Feelings and their influence on perceived truths</strong> : The video discusses how personal feelings can skew one's perception of what should occur in the universe. Leo points out that expecting the universe to align with one's feelings is both selfish and irrational. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging the basis of preferences</strong> : Leo urges viewers to question their preferences deeply, to the extent that they realize that there is no objective basis for preferring one thing over another, such as certain types of food or clothing. </li>
<li><strong>Biases and their impact on life</strong> : Leo discusses how biases can influence one's ability to understand the world, be happy, perceive reality honestly, and maintain healthy relationships. He stresses the importance of questioning biases to improve sense-making and emotional well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Bias and love</strong> : Leo examines the claim that biased actions towards one's children are made out of love. He illustrates how, in truth, biased actions can twist one's perception and corrupt their understanding of love, passing on distorted views to future generations. </li>
<li><strong>Suffering and the rejection of biases</strong> : Highlighting the distortion caused by biases, Leo explains that suffering itself is not worse than its absence from an objective standpoint. He discusses the potential benefits of learning to approach suffering without bias. </li>
<li><strong>Bias and the quest for truth</strong> : Leo concludes by revealing that even the preference for truth over falsehood is a bias, challenging viewers to contemplate the nature of truth and the existential implications of biases in their pursuit of it. </li>
<li><strong>Prayers canceling each other out</strong> : Leo discusses the futility of competing prayers, exemplified when sports teams or opposing sides in conflict pray to the same or different gods for victory. This creates a situation where divine intervention seems to cancel itself out, leading to a perfect symmetry&mdash;if God were to equally favor everyone, it would be as though God favored no one. </li>
<li><strong>Imagining a completely unbiased mind</strong> : He encourages the audience to conceptualize what an entirely unbiased mind would be like, suggesting that the elimination of all biases would allow one to become akin to God. This is because God, according to Leo, is a mind without bias. </li>
<li><strong>Selfishness as blindness to one's biases</strong> : Leo proposes that selfishness results from an inability to see one's own biases. By becoming conscious of biases and their consequences, individuals could choose to drop them. He asserts that biases are, in fact, existentially arbitrary and hold no objective reality. </li>
<li><strong>The definition of God tied to bias</strong> : Within this episode's context, God is defined as a mind with absolutely no biases. Therefore, by dropping all biases, a person aligns with the mind of God, achieving a godly state. However, the demand for materialistic or rationalistic proof of God is itself a biased stance that inhibits this realization. </li>
<li><strong>Bias as a self-defending mechanism</strong> : Leo characterizes biases as parasitic organisms in our minds, feeding off our energy, justifying, and defending their existence. He notes that biases often use fear to resist eradication, suggesting that the relinquishment of scientific and rational biases is necessary to experience the truth. </li>
<li><strong>God as love</strong> : He describes "God is love" to mean a state of being without bias. From this perspective, love is not just an emotion but the metaphysical understanding that all distinctions in reality are imagined. Realizing the non-difference between all forms enables one to love equally and infinitely. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite love and bias</strong> : Leo elucidates the concept of infinite love through the analogy of a buffet with a variety of foods. Picky eaters, who love only a few dishes, illustrate limited love due to biases. Infinite love would entail loving each dish equally and requires overcoming biased preferences and fears. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to new experiences</strong> : He points to fear and close-mindedness as the main barriers to infinite love. Letting go of prejudices and welcoming all experiences without bias leads to richer life experiences and the potential to achieve infinite love. </li>
<li><strong>The Mind of God and Openness</strong> : Leo describes the mind of God as accepting all experiences without preference. He proposes that individuals should strive for a similar openness, free from the constraints of bias and attachment, to expand their capacity to love. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming fear for infinite love</strong> : He illustrates how overcoming fear and close-mindedness is essential to embracing every possible experience, which is analogous to achieving a state of infinite love where no biases exist. </li>
<li><strong>God and the absence of bias</strong> : Leo reiterates the connection between a biased-free state of being and the mind of God. In God's view, all parts of reality are equal and without objective hierarchy, suggesting that one should aim to love all aspects of reality equally. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of Infinite Love Through Biases Overcoming</strong> : Leo explains how pushing oneself to expand and surrender all biases, one can eventually reach "maximum love," loving every part of the metaphorical buffet without bias. In this state, one transcends resistance, achieving what feels like a paradise where all experiences are equally embraced. </li>
<li><strong>Analogy of God's Bias-Free Mind</strong> : Leo compares God's infinite, unbiased mind to the human mind, suggesting that just as God embraces all forms without distinction since they're imagined within its own mind, humans can theoretically think any thought without bias or preference. </li>
<li><strong>Achieving Unbiased Thought</strong> : He describes an open-mindedness where one can appreciate all thoughts, even those that may initially provoke revulsion. This neutrality allows one to enjoy various thoughts, illustrating that the substance of the mind is love before it is corrupted by attachments and biased thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Bias and Attachment Linked</strong> : Leo emphasizes that a mind attached to any particular form, such as a pet or a pleasure, will develop biases for maintaining the existence of that which it is attached to. These biases shape how we interact with different entities, even after our attachment to the original object is lost. </li>
<li><strong>Link Between Spirituality and Release of Attachments</strong> : He explains that spiritual practices focusing on letting go of attachments serve the ultimate purpose of dismantling biases. This allows an individual to realize that everything is equally good, which expands their perspective and capacity for love, moving towards the ideal of infinite love. </li>
<li><strong>Investing in Finite Love Limits Infinite Love</strong> : Leo points out that investing love in finite forms, such as possessions or family, limits the capacity for infinite love. This finite, discriminatory love gets defensive and attempts to immobilize reality to preserve the attachment, leading to biased and asymmetrical love. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Creates Imperfection Perception</strong> : By holding onto biases and not loving all aspects of existence, including pain and suffering, one can't perceive reality as perfect. Any attachment generates a filter that distorts perception, leading to a love swapped from its infinite potential for a finite form. </li>
<li><strong>Implications of Mindfulness on Biases for Self-Growth</strong> : Through the pursuit to minimize or eradicate biases, an individual can progress towards a more accurate, enlarged perception of reality, less suffering, and a broader understanding. The challenge remains to maintain awareness of these biases and consistently question them to foster personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Perception of Perfection</strong> : Leo asserts that the typical human conception of perfection, such as desiring lobster every day, is inherently biased. He suggests true perfection encompasses all experiences, including those that are unpleasant or horrific, and equates it with the ability to love all aspects of existence equally. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of Impermanence</strong> : Leo relates the problem of human attachment and the desire for permanence to Buddhist teachings on impermanence, highlighting that much of human suffering stems from resisting the natural fluidity and change inherent in reality. </li>
<li><strong>Surrendering Attachments for Infinite Love</strong> : He posits that renunciation by spiritual teachers, ascetics, and monks is a deliberate move towards embracing infinite love rather than adhering to any moralistic or puritanical reasoning, and represents the highest form of intelligence and wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Renunciation Versus Materialism</strong> : Leo criticizes materialistic pursuits, implying that renouncing worldly pleasures allows one access to an ecstasy surpassing the fleeting joys such as those from orgasms, akin to choosing the radiance of the sun over the light of a candle flame. </li>
<li><strong>flexibility for Infinite Dreaming</strong> : Leo describes God as an infinite dreamer and states that to dream an infinite array of dreams, reality must remain fluid. He draws an analogy between watching every film once to experience the diversity of cinema and the way God experiences the entirety of creation. </li>
<li><strong>Finite Attachments and Love</strong> : Leo examines how attachments limit one's ability to experience a love that embraces everything, urging listeners to realize that all differences are, in fact, imaginary and that release from attachment can lead to experiencing infinite love. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of Love</strong> : He emphasizes that metaphysical love includes all experiences and emotions, not just the positive ones. True love as per his definition transcends positive and negative, marking genuine, boundless acceptance. </li>
<li><strong>Cautious Bias Removal</strong> : Leo advocates for the careful observation of personal and systemic biases with the intention to incrementally surrender them for greater clarity and love. He also warns against using bias-spotting to criticize others while ignoring one's own biases. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Biases</strong> : Leo addresses the biases within the scientific method, like favoring factual and rigorous research over fantastical and imaginative thinking, cautioning against interpreting such systematic approaches as superior and more truth-aligned ways of living. </li>
<li><strong>Inclusiveness of Consciousness</strong> : He argues that consciousness includes all aspects of reality&mdash;rational, irrational, creative, mystical, factual, and fantastical. Leo underscores that displacing the bias toward the rational and factual is needed for a comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Santa Claus as Infinite Consciousness</strong> : Leo argues that Santa Claus exists, not as a physical entity but as a concept within infinite consciousness. This challenges the scientific bias that devalues abstract, non-material aspects of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Methodological Bias in Science</strong> : Leo discusses the scientific community's methodological bias, which limits understanding to factual, objective realms and excludes fantastical, subjective aspects such as mystical experiences, resulting in an incomplete grasp of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Conservatism and Overqualification</strong> : He criticizes scientists for being overly conservative and seeking excessive evidence for their theories, leading to a failure to recognize and explore speculative, but potentially valid truths. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Against Marketing and Poetic Language in Science</strong> : Leo points out the lack of attention to marketing and poetic language within the scientific community, which hinders the communication and understanding of important scientific discoveries to the broader public. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Proving and Quantifying Reality</strong> : He notes the scientific bias of insisting on proving and quantifying all aspects of reality which overlooks truths that cannot be proven or quantified, as per Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. </li>
<li><strong>Analytical Bias in Scientific Methods</strong> : Leo criticizes science for its reductionist, left-brain bias, emphasizing analysis over holistic, right-brain perspectives, which leads to a distorted understanding of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Science's Rejection of Paradox and Contradiction</strong> : He argues that by rejecting paradox and contradiction, science misunderstands reality, arguing that paradox is a natural feature of infinity when expressed through dualistic language. </li>
<li><strong>Dismissal of First-person Experience and Mysticism</strong> : Leo comments on the scientific tendency to disregard first-person experiences, consciousness, intuition, and mystical methods, which limits the scope of scientific inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic and Social Influences in Science</strong> : He observes that the collaborative, bureaucratic nature of scientific work breeds collective ego and consensus biases, impacting the integrity of scientific discoveries. </li>
<li><strong>Science's Pragmatic and Utilitarian Bias</strong> : Leo argues that science's focus on practical, material manipulation creates a divergence from understanding metaphysical truth and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Constructivism vs. Deconstruction in Science</strong> : He reflects on his own journey from skepticism to the realization that science's goal to construct knowledge and technologies is biased. He advocates for deconstruction and challenging constructivist approaches to expand the search for truth. </li>
<li><strong>Constructivist Bias in Academia</strong> : Academic research often emphasizes constructive projects to attain positive evaluations or funding, but the bias towards construction may obscure truth, which could also lie in deconstruction. This neglect potentially cuts off deeper exploration into the nature of science and truth. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Towards Technology in Science</strong> : Scientists tend to focus on research that develops better technologies. This practical orientation often overshadows the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and leads to tremendous funding biases towards profitable technological research, over areas like paranormal or psychedelic studies. </li>
<li><strong>Materialism and Realism as Scientific Biases</strong> : Science is frequently criticized for its materialistic and realistic worldview. These perspectives influence scientific investigation and interpretation, potentially limiting the scope of scientific understanding and avoiding intangible phenomena exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Over-Seriousness as a Bias</strong> : A prevalent bias in science is a serious, rigid attitude, eschewing playfulness. This can limit creativity and hinder the ability to see reality from different, sometimes necessary, whimsical or conceptual angles, thus narrowing the range of scientific investigation. </li>
<li><strong>Science's Narrow Epistemic Attitude</strong> : Science's epistemology has evolved into a narrow, finite approach, potentially missing out on broader understandings of reality. Being playful with words and concepts might foster different, possibly more holistic epistemic attitudes. </li>
<li><strong>Biases Inherent in Every Paradigm</strong> : Paradigms tend to claim objectivity and unbiased perspectives, including science, which can be problematic. Acknowledging that the pursuit of science itself is a bias is crucial as it cannot encapsulate all of reality or truth, limiting the understanding of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of Methodological Bias in Science</strong> : The nature of science being finite means methodologies employed will inevitably bias research due to reality's infinite nature. Leo emphasizes the importance of an unbiased mind in making sense of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Biased Questions in Science</strong> : The types of questions asked in science are manifestations of biases. Assumptions within these questions can lead to narrowed fields of study, hindering the ability to explore and understand the full spectrum of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Specialization Bias in Science</strong> : Different scientific subfields have biases towards believing their domain is the most fundamental aspect of reality, creating blind spots and limiting the holistic understanding of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Difference Between the Mystic's Approach and Other Sciences</strong> : Mystic philosophy incorporates all aspects of reality rather than focusing on one domain, positing consciousness as the fundamental aspect that imagines all others. This meta approach aims to grasp a more pure form of the truth, inclusive of all science&rsquo;s domains. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness Cannot Escape from Reality</strong> : Skeptics' attempts to avoid acknowledging consciousness as fundamental are impossible because consciousness is omnipresent and not just one paradigm among many, but that which envisions all paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Biases Toward Sober vs. Psychedelic States</strong> : Claiming the sober state as more real than psychedelic experiences illustrates a bias towards sober reality. Leo argues the perceived distinction between these states is subjective and illusory, both being constructs of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Towards Truth</strong> : Leo clarifies his stance on psychedelic and sober states, insisting that he holds no preference for either but remains biased towards truth. He highlights the misconception that there's an inherent difference between these states, which he plans to address in another episode. </li>
<li><strong>Preference-Based Biases</strong> : He considers preferences for thinking versus feeling, or vision over sound, as biases in how we interface with reality. He suggests these preferences aren't inherently superior but simply different ways to experience life. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Ignorance</strong> : Leo warns against ignoring biases, as it can lead to selfish behavior and collateral damage. When biases are ignored in oneself but abhorred in others, it creates societal dysfunction and complaints of unfairness. </li>
<li><strong>Bias in Love</strong> : He postulates that biases are deviations from absolute love towards the finite. To achieve the highest form of love or an ultimate theory of everything, biases must be dropped. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Limits of Bias Elimination</strong> : Leo acknowledges that while it's beneficial to strive for unbiased perceptions, complete elimination of bias is impractical, as survival itself requires certain attachments and biases. </li>
<li><strong>Heritage of Selfish Biases</strong> : He points out that humans are descendants of survivors who managed to persist due to their selfish characteristics, making it challenging for modern individuals to achieve god-realization or pure love. </li>
<li><strong>Steps Towards Less Bias</strong> : Leo suggests a pragmatic approach, starting with becoming more conscious of biases and gradually removing them, beginning with smaller, less impactful ones. </li>
<li><strong>Final Warning on Bias Against Bias</strong> : As one progresses in shedding biases, Leo cautions against developing a bias against the bias of others, which can result in frustration and disappointment due to the biased nature of those around us. </li>
<li><strong>Recommendations for Further Learning</strong> : Leo directs listeners to Actualized.org for resources on existential and spiritual topics. He promotes his life purpose course, designed to provide a strong foundation for self-actualization and spiritual work. </li>
<li><strong>Future Discussions on Bias</strong> : He concludes by noting the vastness of the topic of bias and promises future episodes that will provide practical guidance on identifying and surrendering biases.</li>
