            <ul>
    <li><b>Infinite consciousness metaphor</b>: Leo employs a simple GoPro vlog to elaborate on the concept of absolute infinity using ordinary items like paper cutouts, aiming to conceptually explain reality's structure before urging personal experiential understanding.
</li><li><b>Inherent forms in consciousness</b>: Demonstrating with a paper kangaroo, Leo illustrates that all possible forms and their configurations are inherently present within the infinite 'paper' of consciousness, whether or not they are physically outlined or cut out.
</li><li><b>Differentiation by human cognition</b>: The metaphor extends to address how human minds interpret infinite consciousness by differentiating forms with particular logic and physics, which are not intrinsic to all of reality but are rather human–specific constructs.
</li><li><b>Illusion of separate forms</b>: Highlighting the illusion of separation, Leo communicates that what we perceive as our individual selves is just another form within the infinite consciousness, not fundamentally different from any other form.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as awareness</b>: Leo describes enlightenment as realizing and becoming aware of our true nature as formless, undifferentiated consciousness, a challenging shift from the distraction of identifying with differentiated forms.
</li><li><b>Metaphor expansion to infinite dimensions</b>: The vlog invites viewers to expand their imagination beyond two–dimensional representations to an infinite–dimensional block, containing all potential existence, and influencing how forms perceive and interact with each other.
</li><li><b>Existential revelation of self</b>: The narrative culminates in revealing that our perceived self is also an expression of the same infinite consciousness, dismantling the boundaries between self, others, and the totality of existence.
