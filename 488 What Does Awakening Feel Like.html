            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/fqUJI-NuiJM' target='_blank'>What Does Awakening Feel Like</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Defining "Awakening"</b>: Awakening is a complex and ineffable state of heightened consciousness, distinct from ordinary experience, that is difficult to convey due to its profound nature and the limitations of language.
</li><li><b>Personal Variability in Awakening Experience</b>: Individual experiences of awakening can differ greatly due to factors such as neurology, genetics, and personal interpretations; what Leo describes is subjective and may not exactly match another person's experience.
</li><li><b>Awakening vs Ego Reactions</b>: It's crucial to differentiate between the pure experience of awakening and the ego's reactions to it. These reactions, such as shock or drama, are not the awakening itself, which can be complicated to discern.
</li><li><b>Awakening vs Mystical Phenomena</b>: Awakenings should not be confused with other mystical phenomena, like seeing angels or religious figures. Awakening pertains to a profound realization of self, rather than merely visionary experiences.
</li><li><b>The Consciousness Dial Analogy</b>: Leo illustrates the concept of awakening by likening consciousness to a dial that ranges from deep sleep (near zero) to limitless levels of "sobriety". An awakening cranks this dial to an unimaginable degree, often inducing terror due to sheer intensity.
</li><li><b>Phenomenological Feel of Awakening</b>: Awakening is characterized by an extraordinary lucidity and sharpness of perception, where reality remains physically unchanged but is comprehended in a radically new light. The familiar such as a coffee table, is seen in its 'true' form for the first time.
</li><li><b>Awakening as Heightened Lucidity</b>: The awakening experience can be described as a profound increase in lucidity, making the entire environment–including inanimate objects–appear crystalline, luminous, and as though viewed in a vacuum.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization of Matter</b>: Through awakening, what is commonly perceived as matter becomes understood as luminous consciousness itself, with objects taking on an appearance of both solidity and mirage–like qualities.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization of Physicality</b>: Objects maintain their physical properties like solidity and color but one's perception of them changes; they're understood as mirages within consciousness, with even solidity revealed as another aspect of the mirage.
</li><li><b>Hyper Presence</b>: An extreme state of presence is achieved that can be unsettling in its intensity, surpassing anything previously known or thought to be possible.
</li><li><b>Physical Transformed to Spiritual</b>: Matter is reinterpreted as spirit or divinity. Everything one sees–the room, one's body–is recognized as the illuminated mind of God rather than physical substances subject to biological processes.
</li><li><b>Qualia as Absolute Truth</b>: Experience and sensation, or qualia, are not temporal occurrences but eternal manifestations in the mind of God, leading to the realization that phenomena are not governed by physical laws but are divine, acausal, and instantly manifesting.
</li><li><b>Realization of God</b>: One has an immediate and profound realization of the reality of God, not as a speculative idea, but as a direct, present, and experiential truth.
</li><li><b>Identifying as God</b>: Moving beyond the realization that the surroundings are divine, one turns inward to discover that they are not just a part of God but the entirety of God, overcoming a wall of denial and fully embracing this identity.
</li><li><b>Universe Awakening to Itself</b>: This transition leads to the understanding that the individual is the universe experiencing itself, and that human existence was simply a dream of the universe.
</li><li><b>Cosmic Self–Perception</b>: One's sense of being a small human within a vast universe is replaced by the realization that they are the cosmos itself, transcending physicality and embodying a metaphysical, universal identity.
</li><li><b>Infinite Scale</b>: The concept of scale becomes meaningless as one experiences infinite complexity at every level, from the micro to the macro; every part of existence holds the potential for infinite exploration and is a self–contained universe.
</li><li><b>Existential 'I Am–ness'</b>: An existential realization occurs where one identifies as existence itself, with no possibility of non–existence.
</li><li><b>Transcending Death</b>: Death is either experienced as an ego death and thus a release from an illusory limitation or understood as an impossibility because one's true identity is eternal existence.
</li><li><b>The Surreality of Awakening</b>: Awakening induces a surreal sense of having "broken" reality, transcending the imagined physical constraints of the brain and mind, leading to profound shifts in perceived reality.
</li><li><b>Shock and Obviousness of Awakening</b>: The feeling of awakening is so unexpected and shockingly clear that it can induce laughter because what seemed doubtful before now appears as the most obvious truth – that one is the entire universe dreaming up their life.
</li><li><b>Radical Nature of Realization</b>: The realization that comes with awakening is so radical it defies all definitions of the term, creating a paradigm shift in understanding reality as something far different from prior expectations.
</li><li><b>Deconstructing Misconceptions</b>: Preconceived notions about awakening fall apart as one recognizes them as mere stories and delusions; what is experienced in awakening is starkly different and far more profound than any previous ideas or expectations.
</li><li><b>Map versus Territory</b>: During awakening, one's experience reveals the territory of true reality, highlighting how wrong the map – our constructed perceptions and concepts about reality – was in comparison.
</li><li><b>Realization of Life's Illusion and Perfection</b>: The awakening process uncovers the realization that there never was a separate self and that what was previously considered 'nothing' is actually the rich entirety of life, redefined as both 'nothing' and 'everything.'
</li><li><b>Oneness and Unity with All</b>: In the state of awakening, one recognizes they are not just connected to everything but are everything, including all people and objects; even memories and the past take on new meaning as constructs contributing to this moment of awakening.
</li><li><b>Understanding Infinity and Existence</b>: An awakening can lead to the realization of being infinity itself, which brings an overwhelming sense of completeness and deep peace, marking a profound existential shift.
</li><li><b>Struggle for Definition</b>: The ego's attempt to define the undefinable nature of God or self will fail, leading to the recognition that the essence of reality is an ungraspable mystery.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Perfect Beauty and Love</b>: The actualization of awakening allows for the realization of one's own infinite beauty and perfection, leading to complete self–acceptance, love, and the melting away of self–judgment.
</li><li><b>Gradual Process and Multiple Facets of Awakening</b>: Awakening is not a single event but rather a collection of many glimpses and aspects that unfold over years, or even decades, of spiritual work and integration.
</li><li><b>Highest Levels of Awakening</b>: At the highest levels, physical distinctions collapse as consciousness expands; one becomes a perfectly conscious point that contains everything, transcending form and the known physical universe.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Conveying Awakening</b>: The experience of awakening cannot be fully conveyed or understood through usual concepts of experiences or states of the brain; it transcends all physical, biological, and scientific processes and is not a product of causality. 
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Awakening as an Experience</b>: Mistaking the awakening for a mere 'experience' is a misunderstanding, as it is not a state produced by the brain but the realization of absolute truth, not limited or caused by any natural or mechanical processes.
</li><li><b>Existential bind of discussing awakening</b>: Leo explains the paradox of discussing awakening: keeping silent about it keeps others unaware, but discussing it can lead to misunderstandings due to the limitations of language, mind, and one's current level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as a master control knob</b>: Leo emphasizes that to truly understand awakening, one must 'crank' the knob of consciousness to higher levels, as no amount of thinking, logic, or science can help if you are stuck at a lower level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Resources for exploring awakening</b>: Leo advises his viewers to read his recommended book list, containing works by experts and masters, to help lend credibility to the seemingly unbelievable nature of awakening.
</li><li><b>Warning against simplistic teachings of awakening</b>: Leo criticizes certain neo–Advaita teachings that claim awakening is ordinary and non–astounding, arguing that a true experience of awakening is astonishing and rips apart one's reality.
</li><li><b>The middle ground in spiritual awakening</b>: He highlights the importance of not getting stuck chasing peak experiences or renouncing progress as purely egoic, but rather finding a balance that recognizes the extraordinary depth of awakening.
</li><li><b>Recognizing incomplete awakenings</b>: Leo warns that many individuals believe they are fully awakened when they haven't fully grasped the depth of reality. He asserts that someone who is truly awakened can instantly recognize when others are not.
</li><li><b>Awakening versus mystical visions</b>: He differentiates between genuine awakening, which is a profound shift in consciousness and self–realization, and mystical visions or encounters with entities, which he considers tangential to pure awakening.
</li><li><b>Continuous exploration of awakening</b>: Leo concludes by acknowledging that he is still discovering new facets of awakening and promises to share these insights with his audience in the future. He mentions the facet of 'self–design' as an example of a complex aspect of awakening he has yet to discuss in full.
