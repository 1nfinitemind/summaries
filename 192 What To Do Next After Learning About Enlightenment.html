            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PgJmngka9io' target='_blank'>What To Do Next After Learning About Enlightenment</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Initial confusion post-enlightenment</strong> : After watching Leo's video on enlightenment, one can feel confused and torn between their regular life and the new, revealed truth of spiritual enlightenment. This may create emotional turmoil and a sense of existential aimlessness. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional reactions and the ego</strong> : The emotional responses to enlightenment&mdash;such as sadness, depression, and emptiness&mdash;are natural ego reactions to having one's worldview challenged. Leo advises against making these emotions into something bigger or more destructive than they are. </li>
<li><strong>Gradual desensitization to enlightenment truths</strong> : Enlightenment concepts may initially be shocking, but as with other aspects of life, repeated exposure leads to desensitization. Leo suggests allowing time for the emotions to settle without making hasty life changes. </li>
<li><strong>Skepticism as a healthy response</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to maintain skepticism towards his teachings on enlightenment. Even if he isn't lying or incorrect, contemplating his possible inaccuracies helps viewers stay in an "unresolved state," which is beneficial for embracing uncertainty over seeking premature closure. </li>
<li><strong>Continuation of everyday life</strong> : Despite the profoundness of enlightenment teachings, Leo emphasizes that viewers should not undertake drastic actions based on his revelations. Actions taken while still caught in the illusion may not liberate but may actually perpetuate the very illusions the teachings aim to dispel. </li>
<li><strong>Sustaining self-help and responsibilities post-enlightenment</strong> : Viewers should not see the enlightenment message as a justification to neglect self-help practices, responsibilities, relationships, or health habits. These parts of life persist and are not negated by intellectual understanding of enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Different life stages and readiness for spiritual work</strong> : Leo acknowledges that viewers are at various stages in their lives and personal development. Spiritual alignment, being an advanced stage of growth, may not be immediately attainable for everyone, especially those struggling with basic survival issues or those new to personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Sustainable integration of spiritual practice</strong> : Leo advises making small shifts in daily life to accommodate spiritual work, rather than trying to completely transform one's life, stressing the importance of handling basic life issues such as relationship problems or health concerns before fully committing to spiritual enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Longevity of the spiritual journey</strong> : He emphasizes that spiritual enlightenment is a long process that can take years, underscoring the necessity to continue living an ordinary life, maintaining a job, and fulfilling everyday responsibilities. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of ignoring current life issues</strong> : Leo warns that neglecting current life issues and responsibilities will lead to suffering, as one has not yet escaped the illusion of self; any attempt to run away from life&#39;s problems will carry the suffering with you. </li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing comfort for spiritual pursuit</strong> : He suggests that before one can effectively pursue spiritual enlightenment, they may need to engage in fundamental personal development to create a comfortable life, enabling the focus and emotional stability needed for such a significant journey. </li>
<li><strong>Receptivity to enlightenment under duress</strong> : Leo points out that someone facing severe life challenges, such as homelessness or extreme poverty, will not have the mental clarity or focus to commit to spiritual enlightenment. Stabilizing one's environment is crucial for the work ahead. </li>
<li><strong>Progressive stages of learning</strong> : Analogous to the educational system, where one must master the basics before advancing to more complex concepts like calculus, Leo suggests individuals assess their 'grade level' in life and focus on appropriate personal and spiritual growth stages. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding extremes on the enlightenment path</strong> : He warns against two extremes: completely abandoning one's life for spiritual enlightenment, which can be risky, or fully rejecting spirituality and 'going back to sleep', leading to potential regret. </li>
<li><strong>Adopting the Middle Path</strong> : Leo suggests a balanced approach, keeping up with responsibilities such as family, work, and health&mdash;maintaining a regular lifestyle while slowly incorporating spiritual practices like meditation without drastic changes. </li>
<li><strong>Maintaining self-help and personal growth</strong> : Even after enlightenment, self-help remains valuable. Leo encourages continuing personal development as it prepares one for greater spiritual understanding and the eventual realization of enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Daily meditation as a foundation</strong> : He recommends starting a daily meditation practice to build focus and the ability to objectively observe one&#39;s thoughts, which is essential for spiritual work and aligns with the middle path approach. </li>
<li>Mindfulness Practice: Continue practicing mindfulness in and out of meditation&mdash;it's beneficial for the enlightenment journey. </li>
<li><strong>Time Allocation for Enlightenment Work</strong> : Dedicate between 20 to 60 minutes per day for enlightenment practices. This time can be easily found by reducing activities like watching TV, partying, or aimless internet browsing. </li>
<li><strong>Distraction Elimination</strong> : Remove pursuits of success, fame, money, sex, love, and bodily pleasures, which are ego-driven distractions filling up one's schedule. </li>
<li><strong>Handling Materialistic Pursuits</strong> : While not abandoning the pursuit of success or pleasure entirely, moderate involvement is key to prevent ego-driven overindulgence from dominating one's life. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Depression Post-Realization</strong> : Initial depression following enlightenment realization is normal and temporary. You will bounce back and life will become exciting again. </li>
<li><strong>Ego's Resistance to Enlightenment</strong> : Be mindful of the ego's tendency to reject enlightenment and intensify material desires as a means of coping with realizations about the self. </li>
<li><strong>Danger of Rejecting Enlightenment</strong> : An overreaction to enlightenment truths by choosing materialistic fulfillment can lead to years of chasing desires without true happiness. </li>
<li><strong>The Beauty of Realizing Non-Self</strong> : Although the realization of non-self may seem daunting, it is ultimately a liberating and positive truth about one's existence. </li>
<li><strong>Promises of Enlightenment</strong> : Remember the profound promises of the enlightenment journey, such as eternal happiness, peace of mind, and immortality. </li>
<li><strong>Continuing Personal Development</strong> : Share enlightenment teachings to contribute to a more peaceful world, and sign up for Leo's newsletter for ongoing guidance and traditional personal development resources.</li>
