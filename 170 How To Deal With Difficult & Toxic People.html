            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ll2DXQrVMp4' target='_blank'>How To Deal With Difficult & Toxic People</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Toxicity spectrum</strong> : Leo explains that there is a range of toxicity in people's behaviors, with mild annoyance at one end and abusive behavior at the other. He points out that no matter how positive you are, being surrounded by negative relationships can severely limit your potential and make you miserable. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy on toxic people</strong> : Leo's strategy is to eliminate toxic people from one's life because life is challenging enough without added negativity from others. He advocates for surrounding oneself with supportive and positive people. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of top five contacts</strong> : Citing Jim Rohn's concept, Leo highlights the idea that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with, making it critical to choose those influences wisely. </li>
<li><strong>Types of toxic people</strong> : He identifies various roles people can play in one's life and may be toxic, such as bosses, co-workers, clients, friends, intimate partners, and family members. Family relationships are particularly hard to address because they are deeply rooted. </li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of toxic people</strong> : Symptoms of toxicity include depression, negativity, limited beliefs, close-mindedness, anger, violence, drama creation, criminal activities, and addictions. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate solution for toxic relationships</strong> : Leo suggests the best approach to deal with toxicity is to cut toxic people out of one's life entirely. This, he compares to excising a tumor to prevent negativity from infiltrating one's psyche and life habits. </li>
<li><strong>Cutting across all relationships</strong> : He encourages cutting ties with anyone who violates your standards and values, regardless of their relationship to you, including family members. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgment of difficult choices</strong> : Leo recognizes that cutting out family can be particularly challenging for many people but maintains that it is necessary if they are toxic. He urges viewers to have the courage to make these hard choices for their well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Inevitability of Cutting People Off</strong> : Leo insists that the capability to cut off anyone applies universally, regardless of the duration of the relationship or other excuses, reinforcing the necessity of maintaining boundaries and upholding personal principles. </li>
<li><strong>Boundaries Even with Family</strong> : He emphasizes that boundaries must be imposed on everyone, including family members, as they might exploit lack of boundaries to fulfill their own desires, especially if they operate from a space of low consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Severity of Boundary Violation Determines Response</strong> : Leo explains that although close relationships might warrant more leniency, there remains a threshold of tolerance that, once exceeded, necessitates enforcement of boundaries, even to the point of cutting someone off. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Strategies for Cutting Off Toxic Individuals</strong> : He suggests direct confrontation and notification of relationship termination, blocking communication channels, initiating breakups or divorces, job changes, firing toxic employees, ending problematic client contracts, and even relocation if the environmental influence is too negative. </li>
<li><strong>Not All Need to Be Cut; Some Can Reform</strong> : Leo mentions that some individuals might change if a serious conversation about violated values occurs, but he warns that many in low consciousness states may not respond and will persist in their detrimental behaviors. </li>
<li><strong>Assessing Character and Responding Accordingly</strong> : He encourages developing a keen sense of judgment to recognize incorrigible characters who will likely continue their negative patterns, understanding when to avoid and when to sever ties. </li>
<li><strong>Chess Skewer Metaphor for Dependency</strong> : Using a chess metaphor, Leo illustrates how personal vulnerabilities and dependencies on others make it challenging to cut them off, likening it to a tactical disadvantage in the game. </li>
<li><strong>Redesigning Life to Reduce Vulnerability</strong> : The long-term strategy he advocates involves restructuring one&#39;s life for financial, relational, and emotional independence, ultimately minimizing the risk of being "skewered" by toxic individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Inability to Cut Off</strong> : He identifies financial dependence, intimate relationship needs, and employment opportunities as reasons why people might feel unable to remove someone toxic from their lives. </li>
<li><strong>Total Independence Reduces Exposure to Toxicity</strong> : Leo concludes that the ultimate goal is to reach a level of self-sufficiency where you're not tied down by the toxic people in your life, granting you the freedom to enforce boundaries decisively. </li>
<li><strong>Achieving Abundance and Independence</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of becoming independent in various aspects of life, including financially, in relationships, and within one's business and social circles. Through achieving abundance, enforcing boundaries becomes easier as dependency on any particular individual is reduced. </li>
<li><strong>Long-term Planning to Escape Toxic Situations</strong> : If you feel trapped by toxic relationships, Leo suggests creating a long-term plan to 'untrap' yourself by assessing your situation and identifying steps towards gaining independence over the next few years. </li>
<li><strong>Limiting Exposure</strong> : Leo advises if you cannot cut a toxic individual out of your life, you should assess how much time you spend with them and reduce it. This simple step can halve the toxicity you experience and is applicable even to family, friends, and significant others. </li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Positive Influences</strong> : Adding positive people and digital media, such as self-help videos, audiobooks, and attending seminars, can counterbalance the negative presence of toxic individuals and serve as "virtual associates" that uplift and inspire. </li>
<li><strong>Handling Toxic Outbursts</strong> : When faced with a toxic outburst, Leo emphasizes the importance of not engaging with the person physically, mentally, or verbally. Walking away and practicing mindfulness can prevent the situation from escalating and help maintain emotional stability. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Judgment and Using Toxic Relationships for Growth</strong> : Instead of judging toxic people, Leo suggests using them as mirrors for personal growth. Recognizing similar faults in ourselves through their behaviors can lead to self-improvement. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Leo's Content</strong> : Leo invites viewers to engage with his content by commenting, liking, sharing, and subscribing to his newsletter for further insights into mastering oneself, improving psychology, handling relationships, and living passionately.</li>
