            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/O7COBxw71MM' target='_blank'>The Theme Of Things Going Full-Circle</a></h1>
            <p><em>"There is nothing that fails like success." - G.K. Chesterton</em></p>
<p><em>"When you add to the truth, you subtract from it." - The Talmud</em></p>
<p><em>"God is best known by not knowing him." - St. Augustine</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theme of Things Going Full Circle</strong> : Leo introduces the profound theme of 'things going full circle' in life, which is seen in personal development and various life aspects. He distinguishes between a conventional understanding, like the hero&#39;s journey, and a more paradoxical interpretation where extreme opposites on a spectrum, such as black and white, can actually loop back to connect with each other in unexpected, transformative ways. </li>
<li><strong>Conventional Full Circle vs. Paradoxical Full Circle</strong> : The conventional understanding of full circle involves a starting point, a journey with varied experiences, and a return to the origin&mdash;much like the hero's journey. However, Leo emphasizes a second, paradoxical meaning where the extremes of a spectrum can loop around, leading from one extreme to the other, such as pure black transitioning directly to pure white, implying major life shifts when these points are reached. </li>
<li><strong>Frivolous Examples of Full Circle</strong> : Leo shares whimsical instances of full circle phenomena, like art that is so bad it becomes good and jokes so unfunny they're funny. He notes these are more light-hearted and don't capture the more significant examples he's collected that illustrate how reality can be counterintuitive. </li>
<li><strong>Atheism vs. Theism Full Circle</strong> : Atheism and theism, typically seen as diametrically opposed, can actually transition into each other. Atheists may find God in the experience of profound nothingness, while theists may encounter nothingness as God, challenging both atheists' and theists' conventional beliefs. This example epitomizes the full circle theme by demonstrating how extreme views can shift dramatically, flipping one's understanding entirely. </li>
<li><strong>Hedonism and Asceticism</strong> : Leo contrasts the hedonist, who seeks endless pleasure but ends up unsatisfied and miserable, with the ascetic, who finds greater, unimaginable joy through solitude and self-awareness. This example illustrates how the pursuit of indulgence can paradoxically lead to despair, whereas extreme self-denial can culminate in profound happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Realignment with Reality through Full Circle Understanding</strong> : Leo expresses his hope that by explaining the full circle theme, listeners will develop the ability to see where these kinds of situations occur in life, helping them to understand life&#39;s paradoxes and design a better life for themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Asceticism Misconstrued</strong> : Most people view the ascetic path to happiness&mdash;which actually works&mdash;as a route to suffering. This misconception prevents them from considering or seriously pursuing this viable strategy, highlighting how easily people can misunderstand the nature of certain paths to happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Selfishness Misinterpreted</strong> : Selfish individuals assume happiness comes from greed and personal gain, yet the greatest joy in life comes from selflessness, which appears counterintuitive to them. True selflessness involves contribution and doing good for its own sake, not personal gain. </li>
<li><strong>Effective Selflessness</strong> : People often mistake selflessness for a lack of boundaries, allowing themselves to be taken advantage of. However, true selflessness includes boundaries that enable one to contribute more effectively. Selfish individuals might only appreciate selflessness after an "inflection point" where they choose to become selfless, transforming their lives. </li>
<li><strong>Freedom Through Discipline Misconception</strong> : The pursuit of freedom without discipline often leads to collapse, whereas discipline, like forming healthy habits and working hard, leads to an unexpected deeper freedom. People chasing freedom fail to see this paradox. </li>
<li><strong>Empiricism Leads to Mysticism</strong> : Hardcore empiricism, when followed to the extreme, breaks down concepts until material reality becomes mystical. Skeptical empiricists don't see this coming as they conceive empiricism and mysticism to be at opposing ends. </li>
<li><strong>Nihilism's Inflection to Meaning</strong> : True awareness of nihilism reveals that nothing has inherent meaning, which paradoxically flips everything to become incredibly meaningful. This is missed by those who superficially subscribe to nihilism and those overly attached to finding meaning within concepts and physical forms. </li>
<li><strong>Morality versus Amorality Comes Full Circle</strong> : Taking amorality to its extreme reveals that nothing is inherently evil, transforming one's worldview to see everything as good. True saints understand this, choosing to embody goodness not because of imposed morality but out of conscious choice. </li>
<li><strong>Misunderstood Nihilism and Morality</strong> : Misinterpretations abound when nihilism isn't fully realized, leading to depression rather than peace; morality is confounded with lip service, whereas true understanding of amorality results in saint-like behavior. Both concepts often fail to be embraced to their deepest extents, reflecting society's limited comprehension of these philosophies. </li>
<li><strong>Moralism versus True Morality</strong> : Leo discusses the distinction between surface-level moralism and the depth of true morality. He criticizes moralistic approaches that follow rules and should statements in the hope of rewards or to avoid punishment. True morality, as he describes, arises when one realizes that good and evil are constructs and chooses to act virtuously out of intrinsic desire rather than obligation&mdash;demonstrated through the saintly example of Jesus versus the emulation by priests and popes who fail to grasp the full-circle journey. </li>
<li><strong>No Purpose versus Strong Purpose</strong> : Leo tackles the criticism of his discussions on life purpose in the face of inherent purposelessness. He asserts that recognizing the meaninglessness of all paths allows for the freedom to design one's purpose, arguing that this realization paradoxically leads to a strong sense of purpose. Historical figures like Jesus and Buddha had impactful lives stemming from the full-circle understanding that their purpose was ultimately pointless. </li>
<li><strong>Weakness versus Power</strong> : The video explores the paradox of power, suggesting that the acquisition of traditional forms of power (money, military force) leads to weakness, while relinquishing the desire for power results in true strength. He cites Gandhi's nonviolent resistance and philosophical anecdotes to illustrate that the greatest power comes from having nothing to lose. </li>
<li><strong>Introversion versus Extraversion Paradox</strong> : Leo posits that extreme introversion can circle back to complete extroversion through intense self-reflection and the realization that there is no interiority to the mind. By recognizing that thoughts and emotions are part of the external world, a deeply introverted person can live fully extroverted, dissolving the false duality between inner and outer worlds. </li>
<li><strong>Divine versus Mundane</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the mundane becomes divine when examined closely, challenging the perception that divinity is separate from everyday life. He encourages seeing the ordinary as divine by becoming conscious of the inherent magic in reality that is often overlooked or taken for granted. </li>
<li><strong>Life and Death</strong> : Discussing the relationship between life and death, Leo states that preoccupation with avoiding death can make life miserable. He suggests that accepting and embracing death as a fundamental part of life can lead to more authentic living, thus connecting the seemingly opposite concepts of life and death in a full circle. </li>
<li><strong>Duality versus Non-duality</strong> : Leo elucidates how duality and non-duality are not distinct but interwoven. From a non-dual perspective, recognizing duality as an aspect of non-duality is key, whereas being trapped in a dualistic mindset prevents seeing the unity inherent in all things, including the dual and non-dual aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Duality of Non-dual and Dual Realities</strong> : The concept of duality is highlighted, where Leo points out that in the non-dual state, the distinction between dual and non-dual disappears, emphasizing the interconnectedness of both states. </li>
<li><strong>Knowing vs. Unknowing Revelation</strong> : Leo describes the paradox of knowledge, explaining that the pursuit of knowledge can lead to a form of ignorance, while a conscious effort to unlearn can lead to the ultimate understanding that everything is fundamentally unknowable. </li>
<li><strong>Personal vs. Impersonal Interconnectivity</strong> : He discusses the illusion of a personal and impersonal reality, revealing that when one fully embraces the impersonal aspect of reality, it flips to become a deeply personal connection, intertwining the two seemingly opposite concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Subjective vs. Objective Experience</strong> : Leo touches upon how the division between the subject and object can collapse, leading to an experience where complete subjectivity results in becoming one with the object, leading to absolute objectivity. </li>
<li><strong>Solipsism and Universal Nothingness</strong> : Leo explains the full-circle concept of solipsism, stating that the realization that one's own self isn't real leads to the understanding that all beings share the same fundamental nothingness, thus connecting everyone. </li>
<li><strong>Genuine Skepticism</strong> : He emphasizes that true skepticism involves not just doubting external concepts but also one's own skepticism, which can prevent falling into self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>Ordinary vs. Unique Dichotomy</strong> : Leo's explanation suggests that trying to be unique often results in conformity, whereas embracing one's ordinariness can paradoxically lead to a unique identity. </li>
<li><strong>'No Self' vs. 'True Self'</strong> : He elucidates the mystical concepts, explaining that realizing 'no self' leads to understanding the 'true self', which is the recognition of one's inherent nothingness. </li>
<li><strong>Nothingness and Infinity</strong> : Leo discusses the equivalence of nothingness and infinity, explaining that embracing nothingness leads to an experience of infinity, and vice versa. </li>
<li><strong>Absolutism in Relativity</strong> : He explores the idea that while many view relativity and absolutism as opposites, in truth, reality is so relative that this understanding becomes the only absolute. </li>
<li><strong>The Power of Inaction</strong> : Leo suggests that, counterintuitively, inaction&mdash;such as meditation&mdash;can lead to significant personal growth compared to constant action, which may result in little actual achievement. </li>
<li><strong>Ego Death and Flourishing Personality</strong> : The video describes how ego death does not result in a loss of personality but rather enhances and strengthens one's personality and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Masculine vs. Feminine Attraction</strong> : Leo offers insights into attraction dynamics, asserting that exhibiting feminine traits such as expressiveness and spontaneity can actually make a person more attractive. </li>
<li><strong>Attachment vs. Detachment in Success</strong> : He outlines that neediness and attachment can decrease the likelihood of success, whereas detachment can paradoxically increase success in various life aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Masculinity and Attraction</strong> : Leo explains that true masculinity includes being comfortable with one's feminine side, thereby allowing spontaneity, emotionality, and expressiveness, which are attractive traits to women. Acting overly serious and stoic&mdash;like an unsmiling James Bond&mdash;can repel rather than attract. </li>
<li><strong>Attachment and Success Dichotomy</strong> : Neediness, or attachment, reduces the likelihood of achieving one's desires. In contrast, detachment increases the chances of success, whether in negotiations, business, or personal relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Success Through Failure</strong> : Embracing failure is essential for success; failure should be frequent and used as a stepping stone. Conversely, success can breed complacency and laziness, potentially leading to downfall. </li>
<li><strong>Rationality and Paradox</strong> : Highly rational individuals may struggle to accept that rationality embraces paradoxes and can contradict itself. When rational thinking becomes self-aware and acknowledges its limits, it transcends its own boundaries. </li>
<li><strong>Suffering Leading to Peace</strong> : Excessive suffering can paradoxically lead to peace, as illustrated by the story of Eckhart Tolle who, on the brink of suicide, experienced ego death and found peace. However, this difficult path is not recommended. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom Misinterpreted as Stupidity</strong> : Profound wisdom can appear as stupidity to those at a lower level of consciousness. This misunderstanding is common when people encounter teachings from Zen masters, yogis, and mystics. </li>
<li><strong>Ideological Rigidity Versus Openness to Paradox</strong> : Ideologies can set rigid, linear expectations that block recognition of life's paradoxes. Breaking free from these limitations requires recognizing that reality is more counterintuitive and non-linear than ideology suggests. </li>
<li><strong>Merging Ideologies with Deep Reality</strong> : Empiricism can lead to mysticism, and philosophy or nihilism can limit understanding if not delved into deeply enough. Life's complexities call for flexible thought, beyond ideological rule of thumb. </li>
<li><strong>Reading Books for Profound Learning and Self-Actualization</strong> : Engaging with books is an essential part of deep learning and enlightenment, as they offer in-depth knowledge and inspiration that cannot be fully captured in audio-visual content. </li>
<li><strong>Power of Books and Action</strong> : Reading prompts thinking and reflection, leading to personal insights and a deeper understanding of life. This knowledge is best supplemented by action, implementing strategies from readings into practices like meditation. </li>
<li><strong>Engaging with Self-Improvement</strong> : Watching videos is not enough to master self-actualization, and one must read and apply the knowledge from books diligently to progress in mastering life and understanding complex concepts.</li>
