        <ul>
<li><strong>Self-Control Defined by Leo</strong> : Leo views self-control as the mastery of one's psychology and the driving force behind success, happiness, stronger relationships, better health, financial prosperity, and significant world impact. </li>
<li><strong>Life's Work as Self-Control</strong> : Leo suggests that one's life work ought to be the development of self-control and self-mastery, which will ensure other aspects of life, such as health and personal relationships, fall into place. </li>
<li><strong>Inner vs Outer World</strong> : Leo encourages the focus on internal psychology rather than external circumstances, emphasizing that successful people are those who impose their inner will on the outer world, adopting a creator mindset instead of a victim mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Difficulty of Developing Self-Control</strong> : He notes the complex nature of the human body and brain and likens the brain to a thermostat maintaining equilibrium across various survival processes&mdash;making self-control development a challenging task. </li>
<li><strong>Growth and Self-Control</strong> : According to Leo, self-control grows through emotional labor, introspection, and increasing awareness. He posits that such development potentially strengthens the prefrontal cortex, improving various aspects of self-mastery. </li>
<li><strong>Repercussions of Neglect</strong> : Leo warns that neglecting personal development and discipline can weaken the prefrontal cortex, leading to a dominance of the lower self over the higher self and feelings of guilt and loss of soul. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Tips for Self-Control</strong> : Leo provides actionable advice, such as maintaining disciplined habits, disconnecting from overstimulation, and spending time in contemplation to build self-control. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Self-Mastery</strong> : He emphasizes the importance of fully committing to self-mastery and self-control, convincing the audience that this commitment will have a transformative effect on one's personal life and the lives of their families. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Actualized.org</strong> : Leo directs viewers to Actualized.org, highlighting the site's transformative potential and his dedication to sharing the principles of psychological success and happiness.
