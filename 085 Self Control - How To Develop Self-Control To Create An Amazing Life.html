    <li><b>Self–Control Defined by Leo</b>: Leo views self–control as the mastery of one's psychology and the driving force behind success, happiness, stronger relationships, better health, financial prosperity, and significant world impact.
</li><li><b>Life's Work as Self–Control</b>: Leo suggests that one's life work ought to be the development of self–control and self–mastery, which will ensure other aspects of life, such as health and personal relationships, fall into place.
</li><li><b>Inner vs Outer World</b>: Leo encourages the focus on internal psychology rather than external circumstances, emphasizing that successful people are those who impose their inner will on the outer world, adopting a creator mindset instead of a victim mindset.
</li><li><b>Difficulty of Developing Self–Control</b>: He notes the complex nature of the human body and brain and likens the brain to a thermostat maintaining equilibrium across various survival processes–making self–control development a challenging task.
</li><li><b>Growth and Self–Control</b>: According to Leo, self–control grows through emotional labor, introspection, and increasing awareness. He posits that such development potentially strengthens the prefrontal cortex, improving various aspects of self–mastery.
</li><li><b>Repercussions of Neglect</b>: Leo warns that neglecting personal development and discipline can weaken the prefrontal cortex, leading to a dominance of the lower self over the higher self and feelings of guilt and loss of soul.
</li><li><b>Practical Tips for Self–Control</b>: Leo provides actionable advice, such as maintaining disciplined habits, disconnecting from overstimulation, and spending time in contemplation to build self–control.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Self–Mastery</b>: He emphasizes the importance of fully committing to self–mastery and self–control, convincing the audience that this commitment will have a transformative effect on one's personal life and the lives of their families.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Actualized.org</b>: Leo directs viewers to Actualized.org, highlighting the site's transformative potential and his dedication to sharing the principles of psychological success and happiness. He encourages taking immediate action toward self–mastery and viewing self–control as pivotal to life's work.
