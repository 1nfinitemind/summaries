            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/vYAEr_94EDY' target='_blank'>No Growth Possible Without Training</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of Training</b>: Training, as explained by Leo, is the action of consistent, focused practice within a specific field in life. It is a daily routine that includes performing designated drills to hone and develop skills in various areas such as art, sports, public speaking, and even morality.
</li><li><b>Training vs. Passive Learning</b>: Reading books, watching videos, and thinking or planning about training are not the same as actual training, which involves proactive practice rather than passive learning.
</li><li><b>Training vs. Everyday Work</b>: Leo differentiates training from routine work. He points out that while some jobs may involve learning new things, many consist of repetitive tasks that do not push for learning or growth. True training requires pushing beyond what one already knows.
</li><li><b>Self–initiated Training</b>: Leo challenges viewers to recall the last time they engaged in deliberate, self–initiated training without external enforcement such as school or work. He stresses the importance of personal discipline in pursuing growth, highlighting that adulthood often lacks structured opportunities for training, leading to stagnation.
</li><li><b>Vision and Life Purpose as Drivers of Training</b>: Emphasizing the need for a clear vision or life purpose, Leo argues that training is difficult and requires a compelling motive. He advocates for his life purpose course to help create a personally meaningful vision, which he views as essential for disciplined training.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Training</b>: Leo outlines the hurdles of training, which include the need for self–discipline, lack of external support, potential discouragement from one's social circle, the repetitive nature of training, and the emotional labor involved in pushing one's limits.
</li><li><b>Societal Barriers to Training</b>: He criticizes society and marketing for promoting quick fixes over disciplined effort and training. Leo suggests that these societal messages contribute to a culture of ease and decadence that inhibits personal growth and effort.
</li><li><b>Training as Emotional Labor</b>: Highlighting the demanding nature of training, Leo discusses that learning requires emotionally taxing work, which can be more draining than leisure, especially after a full workday.
</li><li><b>Development of a Training Habit</b>: To cultivate a taste for training, Leo advises consistent practice, which over time will transform what may initially seem monotonous into a fulfilling habit.
</li><li><b>Impact of Decadence on Training</b>: Leo connects the current societal attitudes to those before the fall of the Roman Empire, suggesting that the indulgence and lack of work ethic in society can lead to its decline. He underscores that society's preference for easy solutions undermines the value of dedicated training.
</li><li><b>Erosion of values via success</b>: Success led to the complacency and decay of the Roman Empire, highlighting how achievement can ironically undermine the discipline that facilitated it initially.
</li><li><b>Training and pleasure</b>: Leo discusses the common desire to maximize pleasure, sex, and substance use, which conflicts with the less immediately gratifying nature of training, deterring many from committing to it.
</li><li><b>Maturity for training</b>: Recognizing the long–term benefits of training necessitates a maturity that is rare in the current era, where people are less inclined towards demanding self–improvement practices.
</li><li><b>Getting started with training</b>: The journey begins with a clear life vision, specifying what to train in, and understanding the reasons behind it. Without a vision, enduring the challenges of training is unfeasible.
</li><li><b>Breaking down skills and creating drills</b>: Identifying necessary skills for one's vision allows for targeted training. Creating specific drills and dedicating time to practice are crucial for skill development.
</li><li><b>Building momentum with consistent practice</b>: Momentum in training accumulates over years, not months, demanding mental preparation for long–term commitment and persistent effort.
</li><li><b>Developing a taste for training</b>: Appreciation for the training process emerges with time, especially for those who haven't trained consistently for years or even decades.
</li><li><b>Demosthenes' example of mastery through training</b>: The story of Demosthenes, an ancient Greek orator, exemplifies the dedication needed for mastery–overcoming personal challenges with rigorous and inventive practice techniques.
</li><li><b>Training as character development beyond success</b>: Training is valued not just for material success but for character development. It creates reliable, proactive individuals who contribute positively to society without excuses.
</li><li><b>Vision coupled with training equals success</b>: Successful people across various domains are distinguished by their intensive training, driven by clear visions of what they aim to achieve.
</li><li><b>Training as a lifelong endeavor</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of continual training, especially for young people under 20, to build a solid foundation for their future.
</li><li><b>Accepting training as a cost for mastery</b>: Recognizing training as a necessary commitment with emotional costs, one must persevere despite failures backed by a compelling vision.
</li><li><b>Resource reminder – Actualized.org</b>: Leo concludes by reminding viewers of the support resources available on Actualized.org, including a life purpose course, book list, and further content for ongoing growth.
