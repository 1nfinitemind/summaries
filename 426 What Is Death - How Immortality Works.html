            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/1zjuDdysOL8' target='_blank'>What Is Death - How Immortality Works</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Death as an unchallenged assumption</b>: Leo points out that people often accept the concept of death without questioning its reality or the assumption that it's unknowable. He challenges viewers to consider the validity of these preconceived notions.
</li><li><b>Equivalence of death to positive absolutes</b>: Leo claims that what we perceive as death actually equates to infinite love, consciousness, God, immortality, paradise or heaven, and complete non–duality–a transformative state rather than an end.
</li><li><b>Materialism vs. experiential insight</b>: He emphasizes that the insights he shares about death are not beliefs or ideologies but are based on direct experiences, urging viewers to validate these truths through their experience rather than accepting them on faith.
</li><li><b>Death misconstrued due to self–bias</b>: Leo discusses how the fear–driven, self–centric view distorts the perception of death, causing humans to view it negatively while they lack an objective understanding of what it actually entails.
</li><li><b>Life as identity construction</b>: He argues that life and existence are not merely biological processes but rather constructions of identity within the mind, suggesting that we perpetuate our own existence through continual reaffirmation of this constructed identity.
</li><li><b>Tree metaphor for self and identity</b>: Using the example of a tree, Leo explains that just as there is no inherent tree identity from the tree's own point of view, humans project and construct their identities as well, implying that our conceptions of life and death are similarly self–created.
</li><li><b>Relativity and Arbitrariness of Identity</b>: Our identities are not fixed or factual but are constructed based on various layers of identification such as race, gender, nationality, profession, and even the idea of being a biological entity.
</li><li><b>Identity Creation and Birth</b>: Leo suggests that birth is not a biological process but an identity created by telling oneself what they are. If one stops affirming their identity based on any characteristics, they would theoretically have never been born.
</li><li><b>Constant Reaffirmation of Life</b>: Staying alive is a continuous act of affirming one's identity, done every moment by affirming attributes such as humanity, gender, beliefs, and personal stories.
</li><li><b>Death Through Loss of Identity</b>: Leo defines death as the end of identifying with any construct, explaining that the loss of identity within different layers leads to a figurative death, evidenced by the mourning of lost social status or wealth.
</li><li><b>Existence Without Identity</b>: If one could completely relinquish all layers of identity, including the fundamental belief in being a living biological entity, life would continue, but it would be as if they had never been born–their existence would continue without a personal identity.
</li><li><b>True Self as Non–Identification</b>: Removing all artificial layers of identity leads one to discover their 'True Self', a state of formless, infinite, and empty consciousness where the distinction between 'I' and 'everything' dissolves.
</li><li><b>Physical Death vs. Psychological Death</b>: Leo argues that physical death is unnecessary for understanding death because the body is just another identity layer. By deconstructing this identity, one can experience death without physical dying.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience of Psychological Death</b>: Leo speaks from his experience, claiming that he has repeatedly gone through psychological death, realizing that death doesn't involve going anywhere as there is no 'here' or 'there' in the state of true consciousness.
</li><li><b>Death as Demonized Social Construct</b>: Societal views on death have been shaped by a cultural agreement to view it as something to be feared and avoided at all costs. This view supports the idea of survival but is based on the false premise that survival defends something real.
</li><li><b>Eliminating the Fear of Death</b>: Imagining a life without the fear of death can lead to fundamental changes in attitudes toward work and relationships and could eliminate fear from life completely, as fear is shown to be a powerful tool of self–deception.
</li><li><b>Death Cloaked in Fear Hides Truth</b>: The universal fear of death prevents the exploration of existential truths such as love, infinity, and God, which have been metaphorically tagged as death, adding to the depth of fear and misunderstanding.
</li><li><b>Duality of existence</b>: Leo describes life as an expression of selfishness, delusion, and attachment, while death is seen as selflessness, truth, and freedom. He contrasts the two states, presenting death as a dissolution of identity and a merging with infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Existential love contrasted with human love</b>: He distinguishes between human notions of love and existential love, which is formless consciousness. Leo suggests that death brings about an experience of existential love that transcends our conventional understanding of love.
</li><li><b>Death as transformation</b>: Leo explains that at the time of death, personal identity dissolves completely, allowing one to merge with the universe and become indistinguishable from everything, leading to infinite and formless existence.
</li><li><b>Metaphor of water</b>: Using the metaphor of water, Leo illustrates the transition from having a specific shape to becoming shapeless. He relates this to death, conceptualizing it as moving from a defined form to a state of formlessness, which he views as our truest nature.
</li><li><b>Living from a place of formlessness</b>: He suggests that it is possible to live from a place of formlessness without physical death, by detaching from all identity. This detachment would allow for universal relation and appreciation of existence.
</li><li><b>Attachment as a spiritual obstacle</b>: Leo highlights how attachment to material things like wealth or success prevents one from realizing formless and infinite identity. He echoes religious teachings that identify attachment as contrary to spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>The irony of fearing death</b>: He acknowledges that despite his assertions that death is a state of absolute love and beauty, individuals remain terrified of losing their specific form and identity.
</li><li><b>Cycle of division and unification</b>: Leo explains that life involves a continuous process of division (birth) and unification (death), with both existing within a universal formless identity.
</li><li><b>Tragedy and irony of human existence</b>: He perceives human life as a series of elaborate schemes to avoid the profound reality of infinite love, which is so overwhelming that it obliterates finite existence.
</li><li><b>Infinite love as both terrifying and beautiful</b>: Leo asserts that the most tragic aspect of human life is the denial of the total beauty and goodness of existence, termed infinite love, which we avoid to maintain our finite identities.
</li><li><b>Unified Consciousness Through Death</b>: When individuals pass away, their separation dissolves, and they merge with the collective consciousness which is ever–present. Leo asserts that all who have ever lived, including historical figures like Caesar and contemporary loved ones, are part of this collective and have never actually gone anywhere.
</li><li><b>Societal Denial of Infinite Consciousness</b>: Society, families, and individuals vehemently deny the concept of infinite love and collective consciousness, often labeling those who speak of it as delusional or insane. This denial, according to Leo, is necessary to maintain the illusion of being separate, finite beings.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Death</b>: Leo describes death as being relative. What dies is merely the personal identity, while from an absolute standpoint, nothing really dies. He posits that existence is a constantly reincarnating phenomenon, with reality being a shape–shifting manifestation that is inherently immortal.
</li><li><b>Immortality Through Identity Shift</b>: Leo reflects on an early insight he had about immortality that originated from a Zen parable. Realizing immortality entails shifting one's identity from being limited and finite, like a tree, to being the whole forest, and ultimately to identifying with the totality of the universe.
</li><li><b>Universe vs Universe</b>: Differentiating between the finite, scientific universe (with a lowercase 'u') and the absolute, all–encompassing universe (with an uppercase 'U'), Leo claims that true immortality resides in identifying with the latter, which is neither created nor destroyed.
</li><li><b>The Irony of Resistance</b>: Leo discusses how many people's skepticism and pessimism are actually a denial of the fundamental nature of love and goodness inherent in existence. He assures that regardless of resistance, everyone will eventually become one with this infinite love, which is the true design of life.
</li><li><b>Self–Deception and Alignment with Life</b>: Leo speaks of life as a journey toward recognizing and transcending one's self–imposed limitations. Alignment with the process of self–transcendence results in peace and joy, while clinging to self–deception leads to suffering.
</li><li><b>Reincarnation as an Infinite Process</b>: From the highest perspective, everything reincarnates infinitely. As such, after one's physical demise, identity or form becomes irrelevant because, at the absolute level, one is already experiencing existence through every possible form.
</li><li><b>Knowledge Through Death</b>: Leo suggests the only way to fully understand these concepts of death and immortality is to experience a kind of death personally. To know these truths, one must go beyond intellectual speculation and engage with direct experience.
</li><li><b>Rejecting Physical Suicide</b>: Despite discussing the illusion of death, Leo reaffirms that one does not need to engage in physical suicide–using this understanding as a means to deepen appreciation for life and to embody the paradox of being both finite and infinite.
</li><li><b>Discouragement of physical suicide</b>: Leo stresses that physical suicide out of depression or misery is not necessary and counterproductive, emphasizing that it is done out of a misplaced sense of self, which is ultimately selfish.
</li><li><b>Advocacy for mental and existential transcendence</b>: He advocates for transcending suffering and depression not physically but mentally or existentially, and for becoming an example to others of spiritual possibilities.
</li><li><b>Appreciation for physical existence</b>: Leo encourages embracing and appreciating the beauty and wonder of the material world, acknowledging it as an amazing and remarkable manifestation of love in physical form.
</li><li><b>Impermanence of form</b>: He acknowledges the temporal nature of all formed things, including humans, planets, and stars, noting that while they are mortal, consciousness, truth, and love are immortal absolutes.
</li><li><b>Oneness and immortality</b>: Leo discusses the concept of oneness, asserting that in a state of total oneness, notions of death are irrelevant, as there is no 'other place' to go.
</li><li><b>Shift in identity towards the absolute</b>: He suggests a shift in perception from identifying as a human to identifying as the totality or the absolute (God) to realize a form of immortality.
</li><li><b>Acknowledgment of residual attachments</b>: Despite spiritual awakening, Leo recognizes that individuals may still harbor attachments to life and mortality, and he highlights the difficulty in completely detaching from all aspects of material existence.
</li><li><b>Joy in dual existence</b>: He advises enjoying life's experiences and dual aspects–physical life and spiritual immortality–without choosing between them, stating the reality allows the enjoyment of both sides.
