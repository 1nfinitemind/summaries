            <ul>
<li><strong>Credibility of coaching programs</strong> : It's essential to join a life coach training program that is reputable, well-reviewed, and offers certification through the International Coaching Federation (ICF). The ICF is a global standard body for coaching, so aligning with their accredited schools is advisable. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of certification programs</strong> : Although not strictly necessary, certification programs teach the fundamental aspects of being a coach. They offer practical experience and critical techniques that books or seminars alone cannot provide. </li>
<li><strong>Cost of quality coaching programs</strong> : A substantial coaching program may cost between eight to ten thousand dollars, like the one provided by Ipek. This investment is competitive and reasonable compared to other professional trainings and educations. </li>
<li><strong>Structure of the Ipek program</strong> : The program takes about ten months and is broken into four modules, each followed by a few months for homework and coaching practice. This schedule allows one to train while still maintaining their current job. </li>
<li><strong>Practical experience in coaching</strong> : In-person and over-the-phone coaching training is provided in a low-pressure environment among peers within the program, accompanied by immediate feedback from instructors. </li>
<li><strong>Going beyond the program</strong> : To excel as a coach, one should seek additional practice outside the program assignments by partnering with other trainees or seeking client opportunities, aiming for around 100 practice calls to gain confidence. </li>
<li><strong>Setting up a coaching business</strong> : Besides coaching skills, a coach needs to understand business, marketing, sales, and how to source clients. A good coaching program should provide business and marketing support to help set up a sustainable practice. </li>
<li><strong>Specializing is key</strong> : Selecting a niche such as life purpose, spirituality, career, money, fitness, or even a sub-specialty within these areas is crucial for marketability and success. </li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurial mindset</strong> : Coaches need to operate with an entrepreneurial mindset, as most will be self-employed, requiring a strong understanding of business, goal-setting, and self-motivation. </li>
<li><strong>Living as an example</strong> : It is vital for a coach to practice personal development actively and be the embodiment of the lifestyle they are selling to gain clients' trust. </li>
<li><strong>Useful Resources for Growth</strong> : Leo suggests utilizing resources like actualized.org for advanced professional development techniques, both for personal growth and enhancing one's coaching business.</li>
