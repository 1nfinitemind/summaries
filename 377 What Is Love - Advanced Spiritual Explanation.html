            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XdbcsRxDQvM' target='_blank'>What Is Love - Advanced Spiritual Explanation</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Real love is to love them that hate you." - Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
<p><em>"Accustomed long to contemplating love and compassion I have forgotten all<br />
difference between myself and others." - Milarepa</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational nature of love</strong> : Love is not a simple human emotion, but a fundamental, metaphysical property of the universe itself, more foundational than mathematics and physics. </li>
<li><strong>The universe as a conscious mind</strong> : The universe is portrayed as an intelligent, conscious entity capable of love, challenging the materialistic view that the universe lacks human-like qualities such as love. </li>
<li><strong>Love as an aspect of the absolute</strong> : Love is one of the facets of the absolute, alongside truth and consciousness, which are collectively referred to in Hindu philosophy as Satchit Ananda. Love is not confined to human experience but is universal. </li>
<li><strong>Human experience of love</strong> : Humans experience love as a reflection of the universe's capability to love. Each person&#39;s experience of love is just a small fraction of the infinite, universal love. </li>
<li><strong>Non-duality and love</strong> : The concept of love involves the dissolution of boundaries, acceptance of all reality, and experiencing unity with the entirety of existence, including at the moment of death. </li>
<li><strong>Life as a love simulator</strong> : Life is likened to a love simulator with the goal of becoming the most loving being possible, learning to love despite challenges and obstacles such as war, disease, and personal fears. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose and challenge of life</strong> : The ultimate purpose of life is framed as growing into the highest capacity of love, which involves overcoming personal fears and inhibitions, and fully surrendering to truth and reality. </li>
<li><strong>The myth of 'the good life' without love</strong> : Leo emphasizes that love is essential for true fulfillment in life; wealth and pleasures such as money, sex, and vacations are meaningless without the capacity to love, leading to a fundamentally unsatisfying existence. </li>
<li><strong>Ineffectiveness of purchasing love</strong> : Love cannot be bought as it is an intrinsic quality that must be nurtured and developed. This requires effort, particularly in loving the challenging aspects of life, which is where real growth and fulfillment are found. </li>
<li><strong>Guided Visualization Exercise</strong> : Leo guides the audience through a visualization to recall a memory of love, amplifying that feeling to encompass a universal love for all existence, and demonstrates that love is an active, deliberate creation. </li>
<li><strong>Personal responsibility in creating love</strong> : The audience is encouraged to proactively generate love rather than passively waiting for it. If one struggles with the exercise, it indicates a need to practice and develop their capacity to love. </li>
<li><strong>The true test of unconditional love</strong> : Leo discusses the ultimate test of love as the ability to love all aspects of existence, including those perceived as negative or evil. This indiscriminate and unconditional love is seen as a reflection of the universe's infinite love. </li>
<li><strong>Non-judgment and the illusion of judgment</strong> : Leo posits that non-judgment is crucial for love and that all judgment is delusional. From a universal perspective, everything is perfect and loved unconditionally, a state that humans find challenging to reach. </li>
<li><strong>Spirituality and the art of love</strong> : Spirituality is defined as the art that expands one's capacity to love, aiming for infinite capacity. This is hindered by the ego's selfishness and fear. </li>
<li><strong>Conditional vs. Unconditional Love</strong> : Leo contrasts conditional love (which serves the ego) with unconditional love (which transcends the ego). Fear of ego dissolution is identified as the main barrier to unconditional love. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of hate as a form of love</strong> : Hate is described as a dense and distorted form of love, resulting from an excessive love of the self that manifests as hatred towards others. Love is fundamental in all its forms, whether crude or evolved. </li>
<li><strong>Love's transitory states</strong> : Much like water transitioning from a solid (hate) to liquid (familial love) to gas (unconditional love), love has different states. Most only experience the first two, while few achieve the third, more expansive state. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding love through actions of 'evil' individuals</strong> : Leo declares that even people who commit evil acts, like Hitler, do so out of love&mdash;a highly conditional form that is protective and fearful of their own identity or ideology. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Love and Projection of Hatred</strong> : Despite misconceptions, narcissists cannot fully love themselves; they selectively love aspects they find easy to accept and hate other parts, which they then project onto others. </li>
<li><strong>Racist Ideologies and Denial of Unity</strong> : Racists specifically deny the unity of all people and project their self-hatred towards other races, falsely believing their race to be superior due to a refusal to accept universal oneness. </li>
<li><strong>Conceptualizing Self-Acceptance</strong> : True self-love requires accepting all facets of oneself without discrimination and seeing every part as inherently good and a piece of creation, challenging the ego's tendency to label and deny aspects of the self. </li>
<li><strong>Love's Counterintuitive Nature and Societal Impact</strong> : The struggle to love is amplified by societal competition and survival instincts. Love is counterintuitive, requiring a relinquishing of self to the point of being willing to face death, which society and the ego resist. </li>
<li><strong>Inversion of Love and Hate by the Ego</strong> : The ego, or "devil," distorts reality by inverting concepts&mdash;turning love into hate and vice versa. Self-proclaimed 'good' actions, like hating perceived enemies, are rooted in a misunderstood, ego-based version of love. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Religion on Love's Perception</strong> : Major religions often fail to teach unconditional love and are co-opted as tools for power, resulting in followers believing love is restricted to their own tribe or group, contrary to the true, expansive nature of love. </li>
<li><strong>Barriers to Universal Love</strong> : Closed-mindedness, neediness, ideological leanings, and fears are among the many barriers that prevent an individual from loving unconditionally. </li>
<li><strong>Spiral Dynamics on Love Evolution</strong> : Love evolves through various stages in spiral dynamics, ranging from tribal (Stage Purple) to narcissistic (Stage Red), orthodox religious (Stage Blue), rational individualistic (Stage Orange), communal (Stage Green), knowledge-focused (Stage Yellow), and highest universal (Stage Turquoise), each with distinct conceptions of love. </li>
<li><strong>Transition from Stage Orange to Green</strong> : Many modern men, stuck in the individualistic Stage Orange, struggle to transition to Stage Green, which requires an awakening to love's broader, more inclusive aspects and an understanding of one's role within a communal or societal context. </li>
<li><strong>Potential for Community Love at Stage Turquoise</strong> : At Stage Turquoise, love reaches its deepest, untethered form&mdash;embracing all existence, truths, and even traditionally negative concepts like evil or suffering, reflecting a profound unity with the universe and the transcending concept of oneself as god. </li>
<li><strong>Turquoise community ideal</strong> : Turquoise communities are rare and marked by their remarkable functioning, a testament to high levels of love and development. </li>
<li><strong>Development of love through ego dissolution</strong> : True love, as described by Leo, can only be fully experienced through the dissolution of the ego and the pursuit of enlightenment, which requires time and dedication. </li>
<li><strong>Improving capacity to love before enlightenment</strong> : Practicing love and moving up the Spiral Dynamics stages, such as transitioning from orange to green, can increase one&#39;s capacity for love. </li>
<li><strong>Opening up the heart chakra</strong> : Opening the heart chakra, a significant process, greatly enhances loving and compassionate capabilities beyond mere visualization, impacting both psyche and physiology. </li>
<li><strong>Visualizing love</strong> : Regular visualization of oneself as more loving, even as a simple, daily five-minute practice, can help cultivate a more loving nature. </li>
<li><strong>Proactively creating love states</strong> : Actively filling oneself with love throughout the day, in various situations, trains the individual to consistently embody a state of love. </li>
<li><strong>Experiencing deep, intentional suffering</strong> : Self-induced, mindful suffering such as solo meditation retreats can magnify compassion and offer insights into humanity&#39;s challenges, enhancing one's capacity to love. </li>
<li><strong>Using psychedelics for love development</strong> : Psychedelics can facilitate experiences of infinite divine love, acceptance of oneself, and understanding of one&#39;s fears, as well as cultivating compassion through challenging trips. </li>
<li><strong>Other practices for developing love</strong> : Engaging in truthful everyday activities, overcoming fears, and practices such as acceptance, non-judgment, surrender, kindness, and vulnerability can further enhance love. </li>
<li><strong>Personal transformation for love</strong> : Embracing vulnerability, even at the risk of being hurt physically or emotionally, is crucial for the transformation needed to become deeply loving. </li>
<li><strong>Gender variations in love practices</strong> : Men can cultivate love by embracing vulnerability and femininity, while women should concentrate on being more feminine instead of competing in male-dominated environments. </li>
<li><strong>Unconditional self-love</strong> : Practicing unconditional self-love is key, as it lowers the barriers to loving others and assists in remaining loving during challenging times. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing emotion</strong> : Allowing oneself to be emotional and even cry can be a powerful love practice, as real love can move one to tears by the sheer beauty of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Societal discomfort with public love</strong> : Displays of love can be uncomfortable for those with a lower capacity to love, highlighting the need for courage to express love regardless of societal reactions. </li>
<li><strong>Conditioning self-love</strong> : During tough times, it is important to consciously choose love over ego-driven reactions like lashing out, which requires immense inner strength and presence. </li>
<li><strong>Role models in understanding love</strong> : Studying the lives of individuals like Mahatma Gandhi and Jesus Christ, who embodied a high level of love often at great personal cost, can provide valuable lessons in how to cultivate love. These exemplars faced extreme reactions, from adoration to demonization, because their deep love highlighted the stark difference to those whose egos are entrenched in hatred. </li>
<li><strong>Cost of unconditional love</strong> : Emulating the love modeled by figures such as Christ and Gandhi involves surrendering one's ego, ideologies, beliefs, and even life&mdash;a cost so steep that few achieve it. The ego's inherent divisiveness precludes the possibility of unconditional love. </li>
<li><strong>Traditional religion and love</strong> : Orthodox religions often fail to teach full non-duality and the dissolution of the ego, which are necessary for unconditional love. This results in a judgmental and moralistic approach that limits the ability to truly love. </li>
<li><strong>Burning the candle at both ends</strong> : Achieving a deep understanding of love requires a dual approach: pursuing spiritual awakening through practices such as self-inquiry and meditation, while concurrently practicing being more loving every day. These efforts will converge and synergize over time. </li>
<li><strong>Love as an aspect of enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment has many facets; one is no-self, but a complete understanding also includes an insight into infinite love. Simplistic views of enlightenment can overlook integral elements like infinite intelligence and love. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance of ignorance and evil</strong> : Fully embracing love necessitates an understanding of the roots of ignorance and evil and recognizing that from a higher perspective, hatred is a distorted form of love fueled by ignorance. </li>
<li><strong>Manifestation of love in life</strong> : Love can manifest in tangible forms like career, relationships, and core principles. Realizing this, Leo created Actualized.org as a material manifestation of his love for reality and personal insights, exemplifying how one can transform their love into their life's work. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming personal and societal barriers to love</strong> : Personal weaknesses, limitations, and societal conflicts pose significant barriers to expressing love. By systematically addressing these challenges, one can greatly enhance their capacity to love and imbue their life with a deeper sense of purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Potential for love</strong> : Most people only realize a fraction of their ability to love, and by focusing on growth and aligning various life aspects with love, they can significantly transform the quality of their life to become more loving individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Limited capacity for love</strong> : Many people can't love life fully due to their low capacity for love; personal growth is key to becoming more loving and improving the quality of life. </li>
<li><strong>Leadership and love</strong> : Great leaders must possess a strong capacity to love, as those who can't love become tyrants, while those who love greatly are often idolized and become the foundation of religions. </li>
<li><strong>Personal cost of love</strong> : Embodying love like historical figures such as Jesus is rare and requires overcoming selfishness, fears, ideologies, and self-deceptions. </li>
<li><strong>Developing love</strong> : Cultivating love takes strategic, pragmatic work and a clear vision, not just fleeting emotional states; one must be willing to surrender wholly to love. </li>
<li><strong>Transformative commitment to love</strong> : True commitment to love demands transforming your entire life, setting boundaries, and ensuring one neither tolerates abuse nor abuses oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Visionary love</strong> : Loving at the highest levels is about living with purpose and uplifting oneself and those around, which is why it is so rare and powerful. </li>
<li><strong>Mystical experience of love</strong> : To truly understand love, one needs to have a direct experience of absolute love through spiritual practices or the aid of psychedelics like mushrooms, LSD, or 5-MeO. </li>
<li><strong>Conditional love assessment</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to reflect on the conditions they impose on love and to identify the fears that limit their ability to love unconditionally. </li>
<li><strong>Homework assignment</strong> : Analyze instances of conditional love and fear throughout the following week, and start a process of self-actualization by confronting these internal barriers. </li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Actualized.org resources</strong> : Leo suggests using his website's resources for self-actualization and warns against idolizing him, stressing the importance of independent thinking and personal investigation.</li>
