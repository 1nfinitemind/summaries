            <ul>
<li><strong>Philosophical inclination towards thought experiments</strong> : Leo describes their tendency to engage in philosophical thought experiments, questioning the finality of enlightenment similar to the transition from dreaming to waking. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Absolute Truth within human limits</strong> : Leo wonders if what we perceive as Absolute Truth or spiritual awakening could still be confined within an unrecognized paradigm due to human cognitive limitations. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute and infinity as ultimate states</strong> : Ralston refutes Leo's speculation by affirming that everything is relative except for the concepts of absolute and infinity, which represent the ultimate states that cannot be transcended. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite creative potential of consciousness</strong> : Ralston posits that while infinity cannot be surpassed, within the relative domain there is an endless potential for learning and creating distinctions, embodying the infinite nature of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Dismissal of conceptually transcending infinity</strong> : Unexpectedly, a possibility is briefly entertained that current understanding of infinity and absoluteness might be incorrect, but this notion is quickly dismissed as not a true possibility. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious equates to existence</strong> : Ralston summarily states the principle that everything is a manifestation of consciousness, with the liberty to use any terminology for its description. </li>
<li><strong>Humorous take on descriptive terminology</strong> : Despite the open approach to descriptive terms, Ralston humorously advises against using nonsensical words such as 'raspberry' to describe consciousness, indicating a limit to the flexibility in terminology.</li>
