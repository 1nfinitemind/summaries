            <ul>
    <li><b>Philosophical inclination towards thought experiments</b>: Speaker 1 describes their tendency to engage in philosophical thought experiments, questioning the finality of enlightenment similar to the transition from dreaming to waking. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Absolute Truth within human limits</b>: Speaker 1 wonders if what we perceive as Absolute Truth or spiritual awakening could still be confined within an unrecognized paradigm due to human cognitive limitations.
</li><li><b>Absolute and infinity as ultimate states</b>: Speaker 2 refutes Speaker 1's speculation by affirming that everything is relative except for the concepts of absolute and infinity, which represent the ultimate states that cannot be transcended.
</li><li><b>Infinite creative potential of consciousness</b>: Speaker 2 posits that while infinity cannot be surpassed, within the relative domain there is an endless potential for learning and creating distinctions, embodying the infinite nature of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Dismissal of conceptually transcending infinity</b>: Unexpectedly, a possibility is briefly entertained that current understanding of infinity and absoluteness might be incorrect, but this notion is quickly dismissed as not a true possibility.
</li><li><b>Conscious equates to existence</b>: An unknown speaker summarily states the principle that everything is a manifestation of consciousness, with the liberty to use any terminology for its description.
</li><li><b>Humorous take on descriptive terminology</b>: Despite the open approach to descriptive terms, Speaker 2 humorously advises against using nonsensical words such as 'raspberry' to describe consciousness, indicating a limit to the flexibility in terminology.
