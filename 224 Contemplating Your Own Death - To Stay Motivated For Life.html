            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of acknowledging life's brevity</b>: Leo notes that many people, including our peers and family, lack awareness of life's shortness, which leads them to waste precious time and fail to realize there are no second chances.
</li><li><b>Perception of death in history and philosophy</b>: Leo remarks how, historically, philosophers like Marcus Aurelius used contemplation of death to gain perspective, while the Buddha sought something beyond death, leading to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Life's miraculous and singular nature</b>: Leo reflects on the uncanny nature of existence and consciousness, emphasizing that, despite our scientific advancements, there is still much to learn about the relationship between consciousness and matter.
</li><li><b>Complacency risk from afterlife beliefs</b>: He cautions about believing in an afterlife, which might lead to a lack of urgency in living our current life to the fullest.
</li><li><b>Dangers of distraction from death</b>: Leo argues that most people distract themselves with daily activities, relationships, and work to avoid confronting the existential void and the fear of death that underlies their lives.
</li><li><b>Guided visualization exercise</b>: Leo instructs listeners to prepare for a visualization exercise designed to confront their own mortality and consider what it's like to never experience anything again, highlighting the inevitable loss of all life's experiences.
</li><li><b>Visualization to comprehend mortality</b>: Leo guides a visualization to grasp the finality of death by considering the loss of one's senses and experiences, emphasizing that existence itself is a multifaceted miracle, and prompting listeners to understand this is their one chance at life.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of life's finiteness</b>: Leo encourages embracing life's finite nature as a positive aspect instead of fearing it, suggesting that living a rich life irrespective of its length brings contentment and peace, allowing for acceptance at life's end.
</li><li><b>Powerful spiritual experience</b>: Contemplating death is described as a grounding and prioritizing spiritual exercise, offering a fresh perspective on life priorities and helping eliminate petty concerns and small–mindedness.
</li><li><b>Reflective questions post–exercise</b>: Leo encourages immediate contemplation on what one would miss the most about life, their desires and aims in life, and what is truly worth engaging in, leveraging the heightened state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Reassessment of life's activities and goals</b>: Leo underscores the importance of avoiding pettiness and reevaluating one's goals, questioning whether they reflect a small–minded or large–minded approach to the finite human existence.
</li><li><b>Exercise for sustained contemplation of death</b>: He provides a seven–day exercise where each morning participants remind themselves of their mortality and complete the sentence "If I was more conscious of my death, I would ________" with ten rapid responses.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org resources</b>: In conclusion, Leo suggests regular engagement with Actualized.org for progressive self–improvement and self–actualization, committing time each week to stay on course towards an extraordinary life.
