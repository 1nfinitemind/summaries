        <ul>
<li><strong>Transition to deeper meditation</strong> : Leo outlines a transition from beginner to advanced meditation stages, explaining that this guide is an extension to a popular 'no-bullshit' introductory meditation video, designed to take practitioners from cluelessness to advanced depths of meditation practice. </li>
<li><strong>Common problems in meditation</strong> : He aims to address pitfalls that meditate encounters during their practice, offering guidance on avoiding them, and will provide a schedule for meditative practice. </li>
<li><strong>Stage one - Simple Observation</strong> : The first stage, called 'simple observation', involves allowing the mind to wander without intervention, simply observing thoughts, emotions, and sensations as they arise without trying to control or engage with them, despite the difficulty and potential frustration of doing so. </li>
<li><strong>Discipline and daily practice</strong> : Emphasizing that meditation is a disciplined practice that requires daily effort, Leo advises a minimum of 20 minutes per day in a quiet space, with a timer to ensure consistency and measure progress through the stages. </li>
<li><strong>Stage two - Active Detachment</strong> : The intermediate stage involves 'active detachment', where practitioners work on actively releasing thoughts as they come up in an attempt to find moments of peace, while also managing the stickiness of recurring thoughts without panic or frustration. </li>
<li><strong>Releasing thoughts without resistance</strong> : A pivotal part of stage two is to avoid resisting the appearance of thoughts, as well as rejecting the urge to manipulate or prevent them from arising, which can be counterproductive. </li>
<li><strong>Stage three - Awareness Focus</strong> : The advanced stage, 'awareness focus', requires focusing on the phenomenon of awareness itself, recognizing that experiences, thoughts, and feelings are content within the field of awareness, which is distinct from the content and should be maintained without absorption into any particular content. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and maintaining awareness</strong> : As content constantly arises and dissipates in the field of awareness, practitioners work on maintaining focus on being aware, gently bringing the mind back when it wanders, which is a common challenge at the beginning of this stage. </li>
<li><strong>Meditative discipline and improvement over time</strong> : Leo notes that maintaining meditative focus is a skill that improves with time and discipline, encouraging practitioners to persist and gradually extend the duration of maintaining awareness focus. </li>
<li><strong>Profound question of awareness</strong> : He recommends exploring the profound question, "What is awareness anyway?" recognizing it as potentially the most profound question one could explore in a lifetime. </li>
<li><strong>Stage Three of Meditation - Awareness Focus</strong> : Leo suggests that during this stage, the meditator should become curious about what awareness itself is, without trying to logically deduce or introspect what it might be. This phase is not about thinking or therapy but maintaining a posture of observation. </li>
<li><strong>Common Meditation Mistakes</strong> : Leo points out several common mistakes such as experiencing panic and frustration upon realizing that one cannot control their thoughts, expecting meditation to be calm from the start, not using a timer, trying to stop thoughts completely, resisting arising thoughts, confusing meditation with daydreaming, and attempting to meditate when tired. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance in Meditation</strong> : Emphasizing the importance of acceptance for all experiences during meditation, Leo advises against selecting which to accept or reject as this choice contradicts the essence of meditation and can disrupt personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Goal-Setting in Meditation</strong> : Leo discourages setting session-specific goals during meditation as they add more thoughts to the mind, hindering the overall meditative objectives. Long-term meditation goals are positive, but they should not influence the actual practice. </li>
<li><strong>Bad Days in Meditation</strong> : The acceptance of 'bad' meditation days as part of the learning process is encouraged. Understand that fluctuations in the quality of meditation are natural and shouldn't be a cause for self-doubt. </li>
<li><strong>Strict Schedule for Meditation Stages</strong> : By following a rigorous, structured schedule, Leo suggests practicing each meditation stage for 30 consecutive days to establish consistency and genuinely understand each technique before moving to the next one. </li>
<li><strong>Trying Various Techniques</strong> : Exploring various meditation techniques is likened to trying on different pairs of shoes, with a full month dedicated to each technique to truly determine which fits best. </li>
<li><strong>Month-long Goals for Meditation</strong> : Creating month-long goals for each stage of meditation helps maintain interest and provides a structure that leads to a deeper understanding of one's mind from different angles. </li>
<li><strong>Future of Actualized.org</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to sign up for the Actualized.org newsletter to gain access to further content on meditation and self-actualization. He hints at upcoming projects and reinforces the power of mastering the mind to create an exciting life.</li>
