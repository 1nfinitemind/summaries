            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/8_E9KOBEmMw' target='_blank'>How Your Mind Distorts Reality - Needy vs Non-Needy Perception</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Foundation of Accurate Perception</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of perception accuracy, quoting psychologist Erich Fromm, who suggests that a person's stability is linked to their perception's adequacy. Inadequate perception leads to reliance on idols, while adequate perception allows independence.
</li><li><b>Deficiency vs. Being Cognition/Perception</b>: Leo introduces the distinction between deficiency cognition/perception (D–Cognition/Perception) and being cognition/perception (B–Cognition/Perception), which comes from Abraham Maslow. D–Cognition is influenced by personal deficiencies, while B–Cognition is the perception of the world as it is, free from personal desires.
</li><li><b>Characteristic of Self–Actualized Individuals</b>: B–Cognition is a hallmark of self–actualized individuals. It is undistorted by ego or self–agenda, allowing one to see things in their essence–passive, receptive, and benevolent.
</li><li><b>Abraham Maslow's Insights on Being Perception</b>: Maslow describes B–Perception as an attentive, careful, and ego–less form of perception, allowing one to see objects in their completeness without the influence of self–agenda.
</li><li><b>Differences with Deficiency Cognition</b>: D–Cognition, on the other hand, is an active perception influenced by ego needs, which distorts reality by projecting personal issues onto the objects of perception, leading to an anthropocentric and biased view.
</li><li><b>Problems with Anthropocentric Perception</b>: Leo points out how an anthropocentric perception can be problematic in science, becoming overly abstract, model–driven, and failing to distinguish between abstractions and actual perceptions.
</li><li><b>Difficulty with Paradox in Deficiency Perception</b>: D–Cognition struggles to handle paradoxes, leaning towards rigid rationalism and fitting reality into pre–set conceptual frameworks, resulting in dogmatism and ideological bias.
</li><li><b>Abstract Perception vs. Full Perception</b>: Maslow explains that ordinary cognition often involves classifying or comparing rather than fully perceiving the object, which can lead to misconceptions by imposing arbitrary continuums and evaluations.
</li><li><b>Aristotelian Thinking vs. Self–Actualized Perception</b>: Comparatively, less developed individuals may think in rigid categories as per Aristotelian logic, whereas a self–actualized person understands that opposites can coexist and interpenetrate within the same subject.
</li><li><b>Usefulness and Falseness of Abstractions</b>: Maslow argues that while abstractions can be useful for understanding, they are also inherently false since perceiving objects abstractly means neglecting certain aspects of their reality.
</li><li><b>Perception and Egoic Deficiencies</b>: Leo makes the case that our own egoic deficiencies, such as neuroses, warp our perception of reality. He emphasizes that the interface between us and reality is tainted by our mental health, and perception accuracy is closely tied to emotional maturity.
</li><li><b>Significance of Distortion in Perception</b>: Leo argues that the distortion created by our egoic deficiencies is not minor but a major factor leading to many life issues. This distortion, Leo says, is responsible for recurring dysfunctional patterns that persist despite attempts to change external conditions.
</li><li><b>Maslow on Fully Objective Perception</b>: Quoting Abraham Maslow, Leo underlines the importance of fully objective, desireless perception, which can only be achieved when nothing is needed from the object or person being perceived. This allows for the concreteness and abstractness to co–exist in the act of perception.
</li><li><b>Augmented Reality of the Human Mind</b>: Leo contends that the human mind lives in an augmented reality, where our concepts, fantasies, and desires distort our perceptions, and he challenges the notion that humans are the most self–aware beings.
</li><li><b>Concept of 'Ego Smog' by David Bohm</b>: Leo introduces David Bohm's concept of 'ego smog', which suggests our ego obscures our ability to clearly perceive reality. Thought affects perception in deceptive ways, creating systemic faults that influence all our experiences.
</li><li><b>Deep Systemic Problem of Perception</b>: Perception is posited as a bug in the mind's operating system. According to Leo, this causes many problems both personally and societally, such as war and intolerance, stemming from the mind's biases.
</li><li><b>Practical Approach to Being Cognition</b>: Leo stresses the importance of practice to develop being cognition. He encourages observing without imposing labels, judgments, or any kind of projection onto reality to see things as they truly are.
</li><li><b>Projections as a Function of Deficiency Cognition</b>: The various projections like labels, judgments, and values that we place onto reality are all parts of deficiency cognition. Leo drives home the need to recognize these projections' pervasiveness and their role in distorting our perception.
</li><li><b>Nonexistence of Relationships in External Reality</b>: Leo challenges the notion that relationships between objects exist independently of the mind. He points out that all relationships are mental projections, with the mind selectively focusing on relationships useful for self–preservation.
</li><li><b>Importance of Practice and Awareness</b>: Finally, Leo calls for practice and awareness to turn around deficiency perception. He accentuates that true self–actualization requires the development of being cognition and a shift from egoic projections to more accurate perceptions of reality.
</li><li><b>Emotional Reactions to Material Loss</b>: Leo describes how emotional attachment and perceived relationships to material possessions, like a car, produce strong emotional reactions when those possessions are damaged or lost.
</li><li><b>Value Assignments and Relationships</b>: Leo explains that the way we assign value and identify relationships to objects, such as ownership of a car or dealings with insurance companies, creates a complex web of emotional responses when circumstances change.
</li><li><b>Web of Relationships Influencing Psychological Problems</b>: Leo posits that psychological problems, such as depression or insecurities, are not isolated issues but rather manifestations of a vast web of relationships and projections ingrained in our mental software.
</li><li><b>Illusion of Separations and Boundaries</b>: Leo challenges the perception of objects as separate entities, suggesting that even common identifiers like 'car' create artificial boundaries within a unified phenomenal field, which in its essence has no distinct objects.
</li><li><b>The Ineffectiveness of Mental Knowledge Alone</b>: Leo emphasizes that absorbing information about perception does not change one's actual perception; actual change in perception requires practice and experiential understanding.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Changing Perception</b>: Leo acknowledges the difficulty most people have in grasping changes in perception experientially, which contributes to societal problems. He insists that solving these issues requires dedicated practice beyond passive listening.
</li><li><b>Existential Nature of Problems as Mind Fabrications</b>: Leo invites listeners to consider that the problems they perceive as deep and insurmountable are actually fabrications of the mind and don't exist outside of their perception.
</li><li><b>Exercise for Developing Being Cognition</b>: Leo offers a practice exercise to develop being cognition by objectively observing an object or person without assigning personal values or meanings, seeing it as it is in itself.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions About Rationalism and Being Cognition</b>: Leo cautions against the misconception that rational or scientific thinking equals being cognition, clarifying that true being cognition transcends mental constructs and categories.
</li><li><b>Connection Between Mindfulness, Enlightenment, and Being Cognition</b>: Leo links being cognition with enlightenment and mindfulness, emphasizing that these approaches help remove the 'ego smog' and allow for a more accurate perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Improvement Through Addressing Emotional Dysfunction</b>: Leo advises that addressing emotional dysfunctions and neuroses can improve being perception by reducing the distortive effects of deficiency cognition.
</li><li><b>Impact of Deficiency Cognition on Relationships</b>: Leo discusses how deficiency cognition can negatively affect relationships, with needy or pessimistic individuals illustrating the difficulty in perceiving reality without distortion.
</li><li><b>Being vs. Deficiency Perception</b>: Leo underscores the distinction between an ordinary person and a self–actualizing person: the capacity to perceive reality objectively, without the 'ego smog.'
</li><li><b>Reactions to self–help</b>: Some individuals respond negatively to self–help recommendations or resources, perceiving them as threats or as nonsensical information, which can lead to them disparaging the source or the person who introduced them to the concept.
</li><li><b>Perception on a spectrum</b>: Perception is a spectrum with most people falling somewhere between perfect clarity and heavy dysfunction, with the average person having a considerable level of dysfunction and deficiency in their perception.
</li><li><b>Connection of rationalism to perception</b>: Rationalism, thought to be a clear–sighted approach to truth, has a systemic flaw by which it warps and distorts perception. Rationalists may deceive themselves into believing their constructs are reality rather than figments of their own rationalization.
</li><li><b>Self–agenda versus reality</b>: There is a fundamental choice between remaining loyal to one's self–agenda or to reality. Loyalty to self–agenda leads to distortion of reality, while loyalty to reality will eventually crumble the self–agenda, which is itself a distortion.
</li><li><b>Inaccurate perceptions as the root of problems</b>: Inaccurate perceptions of reality create unnecessary problems and emotional turmoil, similar to a child fearing monsters under the bed. Clearing misconceptions can significantly enhance the quality of life.
</li><li><b>Importance of action for transformation</b>: Leo emphasizes the necessity of acting on cognitive insights to avoid falling behind in self–actualization. He assures that although difficult, personal transformation through eliminating 'ego smog' is deeply satisfying.
</li><li><b>Self–help and personal growth</b>: Leo encourages viewers to actively engage with his content and apply the exercises he suggests, promising that this will lead to remarkable and enjoyable progress in self–actualization.
