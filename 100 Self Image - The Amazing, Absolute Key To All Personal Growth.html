            <ul>
    <li><b>Self–Image as a transformative concept</b>: Self–image, which encompasses our mental model of reality and ourselves, holds great transformative potential for drastically improving our lives. Acknowledging and utilizing our self–image can lead to significant personal growth and change.
</li><li><b>Maxwell Maltz's Contribution</b>: Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon and author of "Psycho–Cybernetics," contributed core ideas about self–image. His observations of patients' responses to plastic surgery revealed that changes in physical appearance didn't always alter individuals' perceptions of themselves due to their self–image.
</li><li><b>Self–Image Defined</b>: Self–image is a subconscious framework through which we see ourselves and the world. It includes our beliefs, what we think is possible, and shapes our actions regardless of whether our beliefs are accurate. Our self–image is mostly influenced subconsciously by our upbringing and experiences.
</li><li><b>Beliefs Shape Reality</b>: The beliefs integrated into our self–image determine our behavior and personality. They can create self–fulfilling prophecies, even if the beliefs are illogical, false, or have no bearing on our actual abilities or worth.
</li><li><b>Potential and Self–Image Restrictions</b>: Beliefs such as being a poor speller, bad at math, or a failure are part of one's self–image and can have a negative impact on personal growth and opportunities. They can create a self–fulfilling prophecy, limiting potential improvements in those areas.
</li><li><b>Self–Image and Relationships</b>: Holding negative self–images, like believing oneself to be 'ugly,' can cause dependency on others for validation. This can lead to bitterness and stress, ultimately damaging relationships when validation isn't constantly received.
</li><li><b>Conscious Effort to Change Self–Image</b>: For significant and lasting change, deliberate action must be taken to address and alter self–image. Actions driven by willpower can be unsustainable, akin to lifting weight with one's back. Instead, engaging with the subconscious mind, where most behavior originates, is crucial.
</li><li><b>Persistence in Subconscious Change</b>: Altering the subconscious mind and, by extension, the self–image requires persistent effort. Reference to Maxwell Maltz's timeframe suggests that a minimum of 21 days is needed for lasting changes to take root, emphasizing the importance of consistency.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Coaching and Continuous Learning</b>: Coaching is highlighted as an effective method for uncovering subconscious beliefs and working on self–image. Leo also encourages engagement through comments and signing up for the Actualized.org newsletter to access exclusive content focused on overcoming limiting beliefs and the chance to win coaching sessions.
