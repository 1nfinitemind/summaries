            <ul>
    <li><b>Enhanced understanding of pain</b>: Leo discusses that accomplishments such as winning martial arts tournaments and undergoing dental procedures without painkillers are not exclusive to heightened consciousness but also hinge on a deep understanding of pain, a concept that most people do not fully grasp.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as a lens for insight</b>: He emphasizes that increased consciousness provides a unique perspective, allowing individuals to examine aspects of life differently, leading to profound realizations and advancements in various fields, including martial arts.
</li><li><b>Pre–enlightenment insights and post–enlightenment growth</b>: Leo shares that he had significant insights into martial arts principles before enlightenment, which were not exclusive to increased consciousness. However, after enlightenment, his dedication shifted towards using martial arts as a tool for personal growth and mastery of life lessons.
</li><li><b>Unprecedented discoveries in martial arts</b>: According to Leo, his post–enlightenment practice led to extraordinary findings regarding the most effective and effortless ways to use the body and principles of human interaction within martial arts, surpassing what he believes anyone has ever achieved in the history of the discipline.
</li><li><b>Ease of victory in the World Tournament</b>: He recounts that winning the World Tournament was relatively easy because his opponents lacked understanding of the principles he had mastered, leaving them confused and disadvantaged. This disparity in knowledge and application made the competition less challenging for him.
</li><li><b>Strategic achievement for credibility</b>: Leo clarifies his intent in winning the World Tournament was tactical; he wanted to ensure that people would take his insights seriously and be more inclined to listen to his teachings and ideas.
