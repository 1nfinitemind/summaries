        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6tLZ2a1uafk' target='_blank'>Understanding Default Positions</a></h1>
        <p><em>"It's hardest to see the ground directly beneath your feet"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Positions - Fundamental Concept</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of understanding the concept of default positions as foundational, recurring throughout his teachings, and critical for grasping the big picture of personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Defining Default Positions</strong> : Default positions are the beliefs or perspectives one holds without recognizing them as such, accepted naturally without needing proof, or are overlooked assumptions taken to be true. </li>
<li><strong>Debunking the Notion of Safe Default Positions</strong> : Leo aims to challenge the notion that certain positions are 'obvious truths,' not requiring evidence, while others are deemed questionable, arguing this approach is flawed and dangerous. </li>
<li><strong>Atheism Examined</strong> : Leo discusses the mistake atheists make in claiming they have no position; in practice, their emotions and behavior often reveal an active belief that there is no God, thus an unrecognized default position. </li>
<li><strong>Agnosticism's Hidden Position</strong> : Agnostics theoretically claim uncertainty about God's existence, but practically, they also hold positions manifested through their reactions to various religious beliefs, revealing their actual stance. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and Reality</strong> : Leo observes that people who haven't used psychedelics often hold the default position that their current reality is the utmost 'real,' failing to consider alternative, potentially deeper realities that psychedelics might unveil. </li>
<li><strong>The Epistemic Trap of Default Positions</strong> : Leo describes the irony of how default positions, such as his mother's skepticism towards psychedelics, prevent people from experiencing the very insights which could dismantle those positions, trapping them in their current beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Death as a Default Position</strong> : Leo argues that most people have concrete beliefs about death, both theoretically and practically, revealed in strong emotional reactions to life-threatening situations, refuting the idea that death is perceived agnostically. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Positional Belief in Death</strong> : Leo challenges the commonly held belief that death is an undeniable event, suggesting it is a perspective, not an absolute truth, and should be recognized as such to avoid misconceptions. </li>
<li><strong>Certainty of Death as Perspective</strong> : Leo challenges the common belief that one's death is a certain event, noting that most people never consider this a perspective but rather treat it as an unquestioned brute fact. </li>
<li><strong>Naive Realism and Rational Universe</strong> : He cites naive realism&mdash;the belief that we perceive the world directly and objectively&mdash;as a default position, along with the assumption that everything in the universe operates on rational principles. </li>
<li><strong>Reality Composed of Separate Entities</strong> : Leo points out the default position that reality is composed of discrete, separate objects, explaining that this is just one perspective which becomes convincing only because it lacks an alternative viewpoint for contrast. </li>
<li><strong>Absolutism in Time and Energy</strong> : He questions the default positions held until Einstein's time that time is absolute and energy is always conserved; positions that many still operate under despite scientific advancements. </li>
<li><strong>Speculative Positions and Skepticism</strong> : Leo examines positions such as "you can't get something from nothing" and overreliance on Occam's razor, cautioning against skepticism that questions everything except the skeptic's own perspective, creating delusion. </li>
<li><strong>Physical and Mental Default Assumptions</strong> : He critiques default positions such as associating consciousness solely with the brain, the necessity of physical pain, the belief in free will, and societal norms like marriage and attitudes towards homosexuality. </li>
<li><strong>Conventional Views of Depression and Nihilism</strong> : Leo suggests that depression is maintained actively, contrasting with the default view that sees it as being passively experienced. Similarly, he warns of the fallacy in nihilistic perspectives that view life as inherently bleak. </li>
<li><strong>Humanity and Society's Evolution</strong> : He calls into question the assumptions that humanity is highly evolved and that society is healthy, urging a deeper examination of these default positions to realize their inaccuracies and the potential they have to mislead. </li>
<li><strong>Happiness and External Conditions</strong> : Leo critiques the belief that happiness is determined by external conditions, comparing it to outdated notions of gravity, to highlight the oversimplification and misinterpretation of complex concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Positions Defending Themselves as Viruses</strong> : He likens unacknowledged positions to viruses that defend themselves by staying unnoticed, emphasizing the gap between what is professed in theory and what is observed in practice. </li>
<li><strong>Perceived Reality as a Default Position</strong> : Leo emphasizes that people deeply hold the default position that the reality they experience is actually real. He challenges the idea that reality's apparent "obviousness" might prevent critical examination of this perspective, even among philosophers. </li>
<li><strong>Empirical Investigation of All Assumptions</strong> : Leo warns against accepting any beliefs or positions without thorough empirical investigation. He suggests that failing to scrutinize givens can set one up for significant disasters. </li>
<li><strong>Mechanics of Self-Consciousness</strong> : He describes a mechanical issue in life and reality&mdash;the difficulty of seeing where one stands because one is standing on it. This metaphorically explains the challenge reality faces in becoming conscious of itself. </li>
<li><strong>Need for Self-Awareness in Complex Organisms</strong> : Leo discusses the necessity for humans to have more than a limited, narrow perspective of the world. He argues that a broader view is required to avoid creating disasters both individually and collectively. </li>
<li><strong>Default Positions as Tools for Self-Deception</strong> : Leo outlines how the mind constructs perspectives without acknowledging them as constructs, leading to them being perceived as inherent parts of reality. This results in self-deception and the creation of fantasies that are regarded as real. </li>
<li><strong>Active Maintenance of Constructions</strong> : He explains that individuals often don't recognize or admit to actively maintaining certain constructed states of being, such as depression and nihilism, which are not natural states but are perpetuated by the individuals themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges to Self-Observation</strong> : Leo speaks about how default positions prevent self-inquiry and self-observation, perpetuate biases, and lead to debating that is closed-minded and dogmatic, causing otherwise intelligent people to delude themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Raising Awareness and Objectivity</strong> : He suggests that acknowledging one's positions as mere positions requires increased self-awareness, self-honesty, and objectivity. Leo encourages not defending one's beliefs as self-evident but rather to admit they are subjective perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Observation as a Key to Awareness</strong> : Leo underscores the importance of observation, stating it is foundational to awakening awareness. He warns that ideologies that discourage observation limit personal growth and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Continuous Growth and Foundational Knowledge</strong> : Leo asserts the need for ongoing learning and stresses that while some topics may seem repetitive, they are essential for building a comprehensive, integrated understanding of life. He promises to deliver foundational building blocks for a greater understanding of life in future content.</li>
