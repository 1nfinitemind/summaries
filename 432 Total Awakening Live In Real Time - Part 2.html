            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/NnpRkE4L_io' target='_blank'>Total Awakening Live In Real Time - Part 2</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Finite limitations of humanity</b>: Leo continues to emphasize the finite nature of all forms of life, including humans, illustrating that limitations are inherent in every species and apparent in their abilities, like a bird's inability to swim or a fish's incapacity to crawl.
</li><li><b>Finite nature of spiritual figures</b>: Leo reiterates that all spiritual figures and teachers are finite beings. Even revered figures like Jesus or Ramana Maharshi are limited, and worshiping them will not lead one to the infinite, suggesting that one must go beyond adoration of these figures to reach a higher state.
</li><li><b>Gradations of consciousness and self–bias</b>: He describes how human consciousness varies from highly selfish individuals to those who expand their sense of self to include their family, community, and eventually the entire world, culminating in a pure, infinite consciousness devoid of self, which he equates with enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Self as an imaginary construct</b>: Leo argues that what we typically consider the 'self' is an imaginary construct, and as one transcends selfishness and fear, realizes there is no true self, achieving a state of infinite consciousness and love.
</li><li><b>Consciousness spectrum</b>: The spectrum Leo outlines ranges from the limited, selfish, and fearful end to those who surrender their beliefs and expand their consciousness, understanding that everything finite is an illusion and stepping into the fear of the unknown.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of spiritual messages</b>: He points out that misunderstandings about his teachings may arise from listeners' fears and biases, but maintains the truth he speaks is the highest form of love, cutting through falsehoods.
</li><li><b>Relative perspectives on spiritual practices</b>: Leo highlights the relativity of spiritual paths and practices, cautioning against limiting one's perception of God to any single belief system or practice.
</li><li><b>Role of belief in consciousness</b>: He describes belief as a barrier to consciousness, insisting that truth is not about belief in a deity but about realizing one's direct experience as consciousness itself, awakening to the idea of self as God.
</li><li><b>Prayer and self–awareness</b>: Leo discusses the common practice of prayer in various religious traditions and emphasizes that the apparent forsaking by a higher power is not a matter of being forsaken but a lack of self–awareness and higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Equal love for all levels of consciousness</b>: He explains God's impartial love for all individuals, regardless of their level of consciousness, using Hitler as an example to illustrate that even those with low consciousness are equally loved and that their death could be a salvation from their self–biased hell.
</li><li><b>The Hitler phenomenon as universal selfishness</b>: He uses Hitler's extreme actions as a manifestation of selfishness, present to some degree in everyone, underlying negative activities such as nationalism and other forms of harm.
</li><li><b>Selflessness and perception of wrong</b>: Leo suggests that absolute selflessness, which disregards pain, pleasure, and material status, would lead to a perception where no wrong can exist, challenging the notion that one's limited, twisted self is the reality when in fact it is the true fairy tale.
</li><li><b>Fear as a central roadblock</b>: Leo expresses that the primary obstacle to awakening and unconditional love is fear, which people often experience when faced with the message of infinite joy and love he delivers.
</li><li><b>Love and fear dynamic</b>: He details the conflict within individuals between love and fear, exemplifying how we simultaneously cherish and fear losing what we love, leading to a constant state of anxiety.
</li><li><b>Perception from infinite vs. finite</b>: Leo argues that from an infinite perspective, everything that occurs is inherently good, as God (or infinite consciousness) creates only positive experiences. It's our limited perspective that labels things as bad.
</li><li><b>Self–bias and fear</b>: Fear arises when consciousness becomes biased towards the self, leading to a desire for certain outcomes over others. Leo suggests that we envision consciousness as an infinite field, distorted by self–involved vortices.
</li><li><b>Awakening as unraveling distortions</b>: He describes spiritual awakening as the process of unraveling these vortices to realize that one is both the entire field and all vortices, thus expanding into infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Transformation through love</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of releasing fear and embracing love as the essence of life and consciousness, exploring and realizing oneself.
</li><li><b>Attachment leads to misunderstanding</b>: People may misinterpret or demonize Leo's message of highest love due to their self–bias and attachments, which skews their perception of the world.
</li><li><b>Relativity of spiritual practices</b>: He warns against being trapped in finite systems or beliefs about God, advocating for understanding and appreciating the complete relativity of all things.
</li><li><b>Prayer through personal consciousness</b>: Leo explains that prayer works not due to external deities but because it engages one's own consciousness, which is divine in nature.
</li><li><b>Continuous pursuit of awakening</b>: The ultimate goal is to continuously expand consciousness and realize the absolute relativity of everything, moving towards higher states of awareness and selflessness.
</li><li><b>Aspirations for viewers</b>: In conclusion, Leo invites viewers to realize infinite love, which is the true essence at their highest form, and wishes them continued growth on their spiritual journey towards enlightenment.
