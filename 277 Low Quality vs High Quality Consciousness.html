        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Hg8JDHlkIrM' target='_blank'>Low Quality vs High Quality Consciousness</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Prime Directive of Life</strong> : The fundamental purpose of every human being and all organisms is to improve the quality of their consciousness, which is the degree of accurate perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as a Daily Test</strong> : Each activity and interaction in life, even mundane ones like making breakfast, are tests and opportunities to operate either in low or high consciousness and to work towards elevating it. </li>
<li><strong>Low to High Consciousness Transition</strong> : The journey of life is inherently about moving from a state of low consciousness to high consciousness, which is a difficult and continuous process that requires conscious effort in every aspect of life. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of Consciousness</strong> : In this episode, consciousness is defined as the degree of accurate perception one has. Accurate perception is crucial because perception is all we have of reality, and inability to perceive reality accurately results in life problems. </li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate Perception as Root of Problems</strong> : Every problem in life, from relationships to business issues, originates from inaccurate perceptions of reality. Accurate perception is the key to a good life and can solve all problems. </li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of Low-Quality Consciousness</strong> : Traits include ego, fear, dogmatism, rigid beliefs, short-term thinking, unawareness of self-sabotage, unequal treatment of others, materialism, and arrogance. </li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of High-Quality Consciousness</strong> : High-quality consciousness is selfless, fearless, focused on direct experience, committed to truth, values growth, spontaneous, responsible for emotions, humble, has long-term vision, and loves indiscriminately. </li>
<li><strong>Your Emotions Reflect Your Level of Consciousness</strong> : Habitual emotions and feelings act as an accurate reflection of one's inner state and level of consciousness. Negative emotions correlate with lower consciousness, while positive emotions indicate higher consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Two Key Gauges of Consciousness Level</strong> : The quality of your feelings and motivations are critical indicators of your level of consciousness and personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Emotions as a Barometer</strong> : Emotions serve as a real-time gauge for one's consciousness level, with reactions to everyday situations revealing the quality of one's consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Suppression of Emotions and Awareness</strong> : Individuals with low-quality consciousness tend to suppress or remain unaware of their emotions, akin to ignoring warning signals on a gauge, leading to missed life improvements. </li>
<li><strong>Ignoring Emotional Signals</strong> : Leo describes people with low-quality consciousness as those who ignore signals from their emotions, likening it to placing a smiley sticker over a car gauge. They lose touch with what their feelings are trying to indicate about necessary life changes, ultimately leading to disastrous outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Micro-Level Motivations</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's motivations on a micro-level, beyond broad goals like career aspirations. He encourages assessing motivations throughout the day, such as during lunch hour or after work, as these reveal true levels of consciousness and dictate one's actions. </li>
<li><strong>Gauging Consciousness</strong> : He suggests a set of introspective questions to assess consciousness, such as examining feelings of love or fear, openness, self-governance, and the nobility of motivations. How one feels on an hourly basis and how one manages to stick to commitments like gym routines or creative projects can be telling of one's consciousness level. </li>
<li><strong>Suppressing True Feelings and Motivations</strong> : Leo warns against the long-term suppression of genuine feelings and motivations, noting that it can cause significant and unforeseen issues in one's career and relationships, eventually leading to dissatisfaction and erosion of these aspects of life. </li>
<li><strong>Addressing Unhappiness</strong> : He addresses questions about feeling generally unhappy with life, asserting that such discontent is indicative of low-quality consciousness. Leo argues that the remedy is to raise one's consciousness, and he challenges the assumption that depression or unhappiness stem from external factors, calling them illusions. </li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of Success, Sex, and Money</strong> : He argues that an overemphasis on success, sex, and money is characteristic of low-quality consciousness. Instead, he promotes transcending these desires for more fulfilling endeavors like creativity, contribution, and deep relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of Being Walked Over</strong> : Responding to the concern that high-quality consciousness may lead to being exploited, Leo explains that genuinely conscious individuals enforce boundaries and are unafraid of confrontation, thereby reducing the likelihood of being taken advantage of. </li>
<li><strong>Increasing Consciousness Daily</strong> : Leo encourages seeking out daily opportunities to elevate one's consciousness, stressing personal growth and incremental improvement, even in ordinary moments. Continuous practice and application in everyday life prevent a lapse into lower-consciousness behaviors, enhancing life quality. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Openness</strong> : Cultivating open-mindedness is crucial for high-quality consciousness. The ability to consider ideas and opinions different from one's own without emotional reactivity improves consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Self Governance</strong> : Controlling behaviors and actions effectively is a key factor in raising consciousness. Various techniques, including strategic thinking, can help improve self-governance throughout life. </li>
<li><strong>Facing Fear</strong> : Addressing the subtleties of fear that influence daily behavior is essential. Recognizing and confronting these fears can significantly elevate one's consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Transcending Ego Motives</strong> : High-quality consciousness involves the continuous observation and transcendence of selfish and ego-driven motives that occur in daily actions and decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong> : The prime directive of human life is to increase consciousness, which should be pursued in daily life, beyond occasional workshops or seminars. </li>
<li><strong>Utilizing Micro-Opportunities</strong> : Regularly capturing small moments for personal growth can profoundly impact the development of consciousness without being overwhelmed by the process. </li>
<li><strong>Integrating Growth into Daily Life</strong> : High-quality consciousness is not only theoretical but should be practiced in all aspects of life, prioritizing growth over pleasure, pain avoidance, or material gain.</li>
