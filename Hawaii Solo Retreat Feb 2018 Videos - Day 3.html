            <ul>
    <li><b>Self–inquiry meditation</b>: Leo described an intense meditative experience involving self–inquiry focused on a fork, leading to a profound examination of perception and identity, where he distinguished between the physical form and the emptiness of the perceiver within.
</li><li><b>Struggle with concentration</b>: Leo expressed difficulty in maintaining deep concentration during meditation, which he views as a key factor in attaining enlightenment. He described his mind's tendency to 'jiggle' when attempting to focus, highlighting the need for a disciplined and still mind to penetrate the concept of emptiness.
</li><li><b>Importance of observation</b>: He emphasized the importance of pure observation in meditation, recommending an approach free from analysis and internal commentary. Leo shared the challenge in overcoming the natural tendency of the mind to seek understanding and latch onto minor insights, which can distract from achieving a major breakthrough.
</li><li><b>Distractions amidst meditation</b>: Discussing the practical challenges faced during his retreat, Leo reported constant noise from helicopters flying overhead in the supposedly remote location in Hawaii. He acknowledged the disturbance but remained committed to his practice despite the annoyance.
</li><li><b>Self–discipline versus temptations</b>: Leo discussed the presence of potential distractions such as a laptop with entertainment options and a smartphone but affirmed his discipline in not succumbing to them. He reflected on past experiences of yielding to temptations and the subsequent negative feelings, recognizing the value of self–control.
</li><li><b>'Do Nothing' technique</b>: He explored the 'Do Nothing' meditation technique, which advocates for releasing control over the mind and thought process, praising its effectiveness and the contrast to other more effort–intensive techniques.
</li><li><b>Approach to multiple meditation techniques</b>: Leo closed by advising on the approach to trying out different meditation techniques, acknowledging the upfront costs of time and the need for repeated practice to accurately assess their effectiveness. He warned against the pitfall of switching techniques too hastily and stressed the importance of perseverance.
</li><li><b>Self–discipline in the face of temptation</b>: Leo reflects on having a variety of distracting options available on his laptop and smartphone but remains disciplined, resisting the urge to engage with them. Experience from past retreats has taught him the negative consequences of succumbing to such temptations, paralleling it with the diminishing allure of junk food after overindulgence.
</li><li><b>Advice for meditation retreat newcomers</b>: For those who might struggle with the discipline required during meditation retreats, Leo advises against bringing potential distractions such as a smartphone or laptop. If necessary, he suggests removing enticing content or disconnecting from the internet to maintain focus.
</li><li><b>Efficacy of the Do Nothing technique</b>: The Do Nothing meditation technique's power lies in its ability to promote effortlessness. By releasing the urge to control or direct the mind, Leo finds this method to align with the intrinsic nature of meditation. He emphasizes the gentle discipline required to let go continually during practice.
</li><li><b>Costs and benefits of technique experimentation</b>: Engaging with various meditation techniques involves a trade–off between the time and energy invested in learning and practicing them against the flexibility and potential discovery of an effective approach. Leo acknowledges the risk of not persisting with one technique during challenging periods, highlighting the importance of commitment to experience true progress.
