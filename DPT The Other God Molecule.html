            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/dpt-the-other-god-molecule' target='_blank'>DPT The Other God Molecule</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Discovery of DPT</b>: Leo shares his discovery of DPT (di propyl tryptamine), a potent psychedelic that led to deep awakenings, surpassing those from five Meo DMT. Despite initial hesitation due to negative trip reports, small doses revealed its potential, and larger doses facilitated profound breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>DPT and 5–MeO comparison</b>: Leo details how DPT lasts longer and is slower to peak compared to 5–MeO DMT, offering a smoother and more methodical experience suitable for contemplation. He appreciates DPT's unique vibratory body sensation and the capacity to direct his thought stream during full non–duality.
</li><li><b>Contemplative potential and non–duality experiences</b>: Leo emphasizes DPT's suitability for deep contemplation, recounting a profound trip where he penetrated the Godhead, realizing the nature of consciousness as pure, unlimited imagination, encompassing all physical and abstract forms within a "pure particle of unlimited, creative imagination."
</li><li><b>Imagination as fundamental reality</b>: He explores the idea that everything, including the sense of a physical world, is imagined by infinite consciousness. This realization allows him to understand the nature of God and consciousness more deeply, recognizing the boundary between imagination and reality as non–existent.
</li><li><b>Healing through imagination</b>: During his DPT experience, Leo discovers the substance's healing properties, tapping into the power of imagination to envision transformative healing, reflecting the limitless potential of consciousness when liberated from human constraints.
</li><li><b>Concept of Imagination as Reality</b>: The notion that imagination can become reality is highlighted, and while we are commonly limited by distinguishing between reality and imagination, in a heightened state of consciousness these boundaries dissolve. The potential of imagination is such that anything one could conceive might manifest as reality if one were conscious enough.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Human Form</b>: The human form imposes limitations on our imagination's power to transform reality; however, Leo postulates that if one were godlike enough, perhaps all physical boundaries could be transcended, allowing for miraculous changes such as altering one's body in impossible ways from a human perspective.
</li><li><b>DPT's Unique Quality for Healing and Enlightenment</b>: Leo notes that DPT provides a type of experience conducive to both healing and the pursuit of enlightenment, more so than the rapid onset and departure of 5–MeO experiences. He attributes the positive nature of his experiences with DPT to his extensive background with psychedelics and spiritual work, which prepared him for such profound journeys.
</li><li><b>Warnings for Newcomers to Psychedelics</b>: Leo advises that DPT is not suitable for new users or those not steeped in non–dualistic practices and contemplation. Without proper preparation and a pure mind, the psychedelic experience can become terrifying and negative, leading to 'bad trips.'
</li><li><b>Awakening Beyond Dreams and Awakenings in Conscious State</b>: A vivid and transformative dream following DPT use resulted in an awakening so deep it surpassed all his previous awakenings during conscious psychedelic experiences. He encountered a former role model, leading to a profound sense of annihilation and unity with the other, erasing all boundaries between self and others.
</li><li><b>Ineffable Nature of Deep Non–Duality</b>: The experience of total enlightenment encountered in a dream state is described as so all–encompassing that it defies communication and comprehension within human understanding. Leo expresses the solitary nature of such an awakening, as it is beyond sharing or even personal reflection due to its formless and annihilated nature.
</li><li><b>Dissolution of Self and Other</b>: Reiterating the complete collapse of self and other, Leo emphasizes the depth of this realization, where not even a sense of having been born can come to mind. In this state, the distinction between identities, desires, and even physical bodies is utterly obliterated, culminating in a total oneness that transcends all typical expressions of identity or separation.
</li><li><b>Non–dual experience in dreams</b>: Leo experienced an unprecedented dream awakening deeper than any prior psychedelic peak, questioning if DPT influenced this profound non–duality during sleep and recognizing the uniqueness of this experience compared to ones following 5–MeO use.
</li><li><b>DPT's legal status</b>: DPT remains unscheduled in many places but is controlled in certain countries and US states. Leo emphasizes the importance of local law awareness and the ambiguous legal standing of research chemicals, stressing caution and responsibility.
</li><li><b>Value of theoretical foundation in psychedelic use</b>: Leo stresses the necessity of a deep theoretical understanding of spirituality and non–duality before engaging with psychedelics, suggesting responsible use enhances one's journey towards greater depths of experience.
</li><li><b>Legality and accessibility of international psychedelic experiences</b>: There are legal pathways to using psychedelics, including retreats and clinics globally, and Leo advocates for undertaking these pathways despite cost and inconvenience, due to their transformative potential.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions surrounding psychedelics and enlightenment</b>: Leo refutes claims that psychedelics cannot lead to true awakenings, arguing they can facilitate profound insights and states of non–duality. He distinguishes between temporary enlightenment during peak experiences and the long–term embodiment of these states, asserting the value of the latter while recognizing its challenges.
</li><li><b>Individual variability in psychedelic experiences</b>: Personal brain chemistry and spirituality can heavily influence one's experiences with psychedelics like DPT. Leo's positive experiences may not be universal, and he advises others to approach with care and a readiness for profound self–reflection.
