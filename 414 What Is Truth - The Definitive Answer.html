            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/nvaPmKQVIuQ' target='_blank'>What Is Truth - The Definitive Answer</a></h1>
            <p><em>"How come Truth is such a slippery beast?" - Douglas Hofstadter</em></p>
<p><em>"If you find Truth you will become invincible." - Epictetus</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about truth</strong> : People often think that truth is defined as a belief, concept, philosophy, knowledge, theory, model, the domain of scientists or religious leaders, or that it must be logical and provable. They may also consider it irrelevant to everyday life&mdash;all of which Leo challenges as false. </li>
<li><strong>Relative vs. Absolute Truth</strong> : Truth is divided into relative and absolute. Relative truths are conceptual and exist in the mind, dependent on various factors, and include most things we consider certain. Absolute truth, however, is true under all circumstances, non-conceptual, and actual. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of Relative Truth</strong> : Statements like "the sky is blue", "the Eiffel Tower is in Paris", and "one plus one equals two" are cited as relative because they rely on contexts like location, time, symbols, interpretation, language, and the cognitive functions of the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Language and Cognitive Assumptions</strong> : Recognizing truths such as "the sky is blue" requires language and higher interpretative functions. Most humans take for granted assumptions like other beings' consciousness and understanding, leading to a narrow, human-centric view of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Contingency and Interpretation of Relative Truths</strong> : Relative truths are contingent upon various conditions and interpretations. For instance, "the sky is blue" depends on factors like the observer's planet, time of day, and even species, since not all beings may perceive color or even the concept of 'sky.' </li>
<li><strong>Correspondence Theory of Truth</strong> : This theory suggests that truths are what correspond with an external reality. Leo critiques it, indicating the gap between the raw existence of objects and our cognitive affirmation of their truth. </li>
<li><strong>Discovery of Absolute Truth</strong> : Leo shares a personal episode of realizing absolute truth while questioning the essence of truth. He describes it as a profound experience of present-moment being that arose when the conceptual notion of truth melted away. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Truth as Present Being</strong> : Leo elucidates absolute truth as the entirety of the present moment, encountered in an ordinary yet extraordinary realization. It's suggested that substances like LSD can facilitate this awareness, but the experience is also accessible to all through determined exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Homework to Understand Advanced Concepts</strong> : Leo stresses the complexity of understanding truth and encourages listeners to actively engage in questioning and seeking the truth themselves, rather than passively accepting his explanations. </li>
<li><strong>Correspondence theory of truth</strong> : The theory that truth corresponds to reality and relies on symbols and concepts is flawed because it confines truth to mental constructs rather than acknowledging the distinction between experiencing something as real (such as the sky being blue) and the mental affirmation of that experience. </li>
<li><strong>Difference between experience and mental affirmation</strong> : It's critical to distinguish between the raw experience of reality (like the sky's blueness) and the cognitive layer we add to it (believing or affirming that the sky is blue). This distinction exemplifies the gap between second-order mental constructs (relative truths) and first-order experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Relative truths and their opposites</strong> : Relative truths, unlike absolute truths, exist within a duality framework, where for every truth, there is a corresponding falsehood. This binary view does not apply to the concept of absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute truth as actual reality</strong> : Leo demonstrates that the actual existence of something (like one's hand or the room they are in) represents absolute truth. Absolute truth is just "that which is," encompassing all of reality and existence. However, he acknowledges the complexity in defining "isness" or existence itself. </li>
<li><strong>Existence as a prerequisite for truth</strong> : Leo equates existence with truth, and by extension, the actual state of reality at all points in space and time. He elucidates that knowledge of reality is just a part of actual reality, which includes everything and is synonymous with truth. </li>
<li><strong>Truth as the actual state of reality</strong> : Reality cannot be reduced to symbols or knowledge as it is the actual state of all "bits" or facts of existence, much like the state of all bits on a computer hard drive. Truth is not contingent on whether these bits are "on" or "off"; it encompasses all states and is independent of human knowledge or affirmation. </li>
<li><strong>Reality constructed by truth, not atoms</strong> : Contrary to scientific assertions that reality is made of atoms, Leo argues that reality is made of truth, which is a more fundamental constituent than particles. Understanding this requires a change in consciousness and can lead to epiphanies or awakenings. </li>
<li><strong>Truth as inescapable</strong> : Leo emphasizes that truth encompasses everything that ever was, is, or will be. Even the hypothetical absence of any state of reality would still be a form of truth, as truth is not conditional on particular circumstances or states. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of truth through conscious awareness</strong> : A profound realization of truth involves more than just cognitive understanding; it requires direct conscious awareness of reality and experiencing its realness. This understanding transcends conventional human experience and necessitates a deep self-awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Truth as the State of All Creation</strong> : From the perspective of an omniscient observer, the absolute truth includes every event in history and every possibility in the future. Every microscopic detail like a particle on a leaf is as much a part of the absolute truth as the totality of creation. </li>
<li><strong>Symbolic Equations and Isness</strong> : Through the equation "1+1=3", Leo illustrates that beyond symbolic correctness, there is a fundamental existence of the equation, making it a part of the ultimate truth. He distinguishes between "knowledge" (symbolic interpretation) and "isness" (existence as truth). </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Existence of False Concepts within Truth</strong> : Leo explains that concepts like falsehood and non-existence, despite being perceived as opposites to truth, actually exist as ideas within the mind. Thus, they are included in the absolute truth as they are part of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of Non-Existence</strong> : The idea of non-existence has to exist conceptually to be considered, which paradoxically brings it into existence. Consequently, Leo asserts that absolute truth only acknowledges existence, making non-existence and falsehood conceptually impossible. </li>
<li><strong>Conceptualizing Non-Existence</strong> : When people consider non-existence, they are engaging in mental exercises that lead to illusions and misunderstandings. The example of an imaginary kangaroo demonstrates that all conceptions, including those implying non-existence, are part of existence and thus, truth. </li>
<li><strong>Death and the Continuity of Existence</strong> : Challenging the traditional view of death, Leo suggests that our understanding of death as non-existence might be conceptually flawed, opening up possibilities that death may not be final. </li>
<li><strong>Defining Isness and Existence</strong> : The effort to define "isness" and "existence" is challenging due to the limitations of language, logic, and the human mind. Recognition of the truth requires a deep personal insight that transcends these limitations. </li>
<li><strong>Deepening Awareness to Understand Existence</strong> : Leo encourages a continuous and intensifying focus on existence itself (isness) to realize its true nature, which involves a shift in consciousness rather than the accumulation of knowledge or evidence. </li>
<li><strong>Truth as Inescapable and Absolute</strong> : Even if the universe were to be destroyed, the truth would persist, for truth reflects whatever is the case. Truth's existence is unconditional and independent of the universe's details. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Consciousness Shift to Realize Truth</strong> : To recognize truth, a fundamental shift in one's state of consciousness is necessary, beyond mere intellectual thinking or logical deduction. </li>
<li><strong>Analogy of the universe's states</strong> : Like bits in a hard drive, the universe can be in different states ('off', 'on', or anything in between), yet these states don't alter the intrinsic nature of existence or truth. </li>
<li><strong>Non-existence as a concept</strong> : Non-existence is a mental construct; it has to exist conceptually to be considered, so a 'wiped clean' universe would still embody pure, empty existence or 'isness', which is absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Truth prior to physical existence</strong> : Truth is fundamental, existing before all objects, time, space, and the universe; all these elements are merely aspects of ultimate truth. </li>
<li><strong>Experience and the illusion of perception</strong> : The concept of experience or perception is an illusion, cast by the mind to sustain the belief in one's human existence. Leo explains there is only absolute truth, and what we consider experience is a mind projection. </li>
<li><strong>Ego's co-option of truth</strong> : The ego converts actuality (absolute truth or isness) into a 'conceptual amalgam' conventionally perceived as experience, which hinders understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception of human experience</strong> : What is thought to be human experience is, in fact, the universe experiencing itself in various forms&mdash;emotions, sensations, and consciousness are all the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Absence of subjectivity</strong> : There are no biological entities, sense organs, perception, subjectivity, or individuals. Only absolute truth exists objectively. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional reactions as defense mechanisms</strong> : Fear, anger, or criticism against these ideas are mental defenses trying to preserve the illusion of personal existence and distract from the truth. </li>
<li><strong>Unification of metaphysics and epistemology</strong> : In non-duality, there is no experiencer or perceiver; pure experience or perception is recontextualized as absolute truth, merging metaphysics and epistemology. </li>
<li><strong>Paradoxical features of absolute truth</strong> : Absolute truth is infinite, singular, paradoxical, and cannot be proven, communicated, symbolized, enumerated, or captured by logic. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as pure existence</strong> : Pure consciousness has no form or quality and contains all qualities and forms; it is both everything and nothing, the embodiment of absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Complexity of understanding truth</strong> : Truth encompasses consciousness, God, love, and is multi-dimensional, eternal, all-powerful, and uncaused&mdash;it is the reality of oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Role of exploring truth</strong> : Exploring truth requires persistent effort and understanding its various aspects and is essentially realizing one's inherent truth, distinct from what is known or thought. </li>
<li><strong>Origin of Truth</strong> : Truth did not emerge from anywhere as the concept of origins and destinations are part of the truth itself. Anything that exists or is the case is truth. Therefore, saying that truth came from somewhere is nonsensical because that somewhere would also be truth. Truth is nothingness, which simultaneously is everything&mdash;this is infinity and encapsulates all of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Potential for Self-Delusion</strong> : Leo acknowledges that it might seem possible for one to be deluded about truth, especially when discussing the effects of psychedelics like LSD. However, truth is the most fundamental component of reality and cannot be further explained or justified with stories or validations. He advises using the techniques he's provided to personally access the truth. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute vs. Conceptual Truth</strong> : Leo differentiates between absolute truth, which is boundless and includes all concepts, and conceptual truths, which are subject to imagination and misunderstanding. Absolute truth is the sum of all possible concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Science's Validation of Truth</strong> : Leo questions the need for science to validate truth since truth is a personal realization. Those who award recognitions like the Nobel Prize may themselves lack awareness of what truth is. He suggests that external validation is not necessary for personal realizations of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Truth versus Relative Truths</strong> : While relative truths from science and math are practical for living and manipulating reality, they don't encompass absolute truth, which is infinite and doesn't require substantiation through relative truths. Absolute truth is non-dual, but it's useful to talk about relative truth when functioning in the everyday dualistic world. </li>
<li><strong>Utility and Practicality of Absolute Truth</strong> : Leo states that absolute truth is not practical in the conventional sense but is essential as it forms the substance of the universe and all existence. It's so fundamentally useful that it becomes impractical from a human perspective. The function of absolute truth is to be the substance and isness of everything that exists. </li>
<li><strong>Misguided motivation for truth</strong> : Asking "what's in it for me" regarding the pursuit of truth is an unhelpful approach, and stopping this mindset can solve many of life's problems. </li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of truth is a choice</strong> : There is no obligation to pursue truth; it should be motivated by curiosity, interest, or an appreciation for truth itself. Otherwise, one can choose not to engage with it. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of pursuing truth</strong> : While seeking truth may not appear practically beneficial, it can greatly reduce suffering, as suffering is rooted in illusion and falsehood. </li>
<li><strong>Selfish vs. Higher Motivations for truth</strong> : The pursuit of truth should ideally stem from an appreciation of its inherent beauty and love, not solely as an escape from suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Methods for discovering absolute truth</strong> : Practices like meditation, Kriya yoga, psychedelics, self-inquiry, contemplation, and consuming educational content are recommended pathways towards understanding truth. </li>
<li><strong>Extreme spiritual techniques</strong> : Historically, intense experiences like Vision Quests and authentic baptism have been used to uncover truth but can be painful and dangerous, thus not recommended. </li>
<li><strong>Validating the discovery of truth</strong> : Genuine awakening to absolute truth is inherently self-validating and evident to the individual without need for external affirmation. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and truth</strong> : Psychedelics are posited to reveal absolute truth, not due to their chemical composition but through the profound experiences they induce which are beyond logical explanation. </li>
<li><strong>Truth and love as identical</strong> : Truth, love, and consciousness are described as indistinguishably intertwined, constituting the very substrate of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Singularity of absolute truth</strong> : Absolute truth is singular and immutable, regardless of the diversity in personal interpretations or expressions of it. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's words and truth</strong> : Leo's words are not the absolute truth but serve as pointers to provoke personal exploration and realization of truth in the viewer. </li>
<li><strong>Claiming to know absolute truth</strong> : Professing to know the absolute truth is not egotistical if it is based on genuine experience rather than conceptual knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Warnings about truth</strong> : Caution is advised against those claiming proprietary knowledge of truth, and the concept of truth should not be reduced to mind or brain properties or mistaken for mere formlessness or cessation. </li>
<li><strong>Truth's evolving understanding</strong> : Recognizing that one's current comprehension of truth is sufficient for sharing but acknowledging there are deeper levels yet to be explored. </li>
<li><strong>Cessation and Formlessness</strong> : Leo describes that realization of the absolute truth doesn't necessitate cessation of experience; form and formlessness are identical. The relative domain is absolute truth disguised, indicating experiences and lack thereof are equally true aspects of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening does not guarantee absolute truth</strong> : Awakening experiences, such as glimpsing no-self or realizing one's own non-reality, do not equate to full comprehension of absolute truth. Deeper exploration and multiple awakenings may be necessary to grasp its full extent. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity of altered consciousness for truth</strong> : Absolute truth can't be thought into existence; it requires a significant change in one's state of consciousness, potentially achievable through psychedelics, yoga, concentration, or meditation retreats. </li>
<li><strong>Confusion between absolute truth and beliefs</strong> : What one may consider absolute truth is often mistaken. Thoughts and conceptions are likely to be falsehoods masquerading as truth. </li>
<li><strong>Psychology and truth connection</strong> : Personal dissatisfaction and emotional issues result from a disconnection with the truth. Therapy and self-actualization are akin to strengthening oneself to bear the truth, suggesting that facing truth is a therapeutic process. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Practical importance of truth</strong> : Leo conveys that awareness of absolute truth is crucial for understanding one's true nature and leading a fulfilled life, emphasizing that material success does not resolve the fundamental disconnect from truth. </li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of truth over material success</strong> : Instead of seeking wealth or status, becoming a truth-seeker is posited as the ultimate means to reduce suffering and bring about profound personal change. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org's role as a mental scaffold</strong> : The website serves as a temporary support structure to inspire self-discovery. Leo suggests using the provided resources as tools rather than dogma, to be discarded once their purpose is served.</li>
