<li><strong>Recognition of self-created stress</strong> : Leo stresses that all stress is self-created, emphasizing an advanced point in personal development where individuals realize stress arises from their own reactions, not the circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Accepting responsibility</strong> : He urges viewers to take full responsibility for their feelings and thoughts, understanding that every stressful situation in life is due to one's conscious or unconscious choices. </li>
<li><strong>Stress as a choice</strong> : Leo challenges the audience to see their stress as a result of choices they've made, such as their job, relationship, or lifestyle, and to be mindful of their ability to change these aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Inner-outer world dynamics</strong> : Leo highlights the importance of recognizing the distinction between the inner and outer worlds, indicating that the real source of stress is not external circumstances but one's response to them, echoing beliefs from various philosophies. </li>
<li><strong>Opportunities for change</strong> : He identifies that by acknowledging the self-creation of stress, individuals can find opportunities for improvement in their lives, such as changing jobs, leaving unhealthy relationships, or starting passion projects. </li>
