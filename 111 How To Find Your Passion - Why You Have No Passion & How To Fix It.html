            <ul>
<li><strong>Reality of Finding Passion</strong> : Most people lack a life passion, with 99% not having it figured out. Realizing that one is normal in this aspect is the first step, but understanding it takes time and effort to find true passion is crucial. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about Passion</strong> : Many have the misconception that finding passion should be effortless. However, the willingness to put in work towards discovering passion is essential, as it doesn't happen by accident. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of Effort toward Passion</strong> : Discovering genuine passion in one's life is a worthwhile pursuit. It can be so transformative that it justifies years of effort and potential sacrifices in other areas of life. </li>
<li><strong>Authenticity as a Core of Passion</strong> : Passion is intrinsically linked to authenticity. To find passion, one must partly discover and partly create it. The lack of a clear sense of identity leads to inauthentic living and hinders the emergence of true passion. </li>
<li><strong>Inauthenticity Obstacles</strong> : Conditioned by societal norms, parental expectations, education, and limiting beliefs, individuals lose touch with their authentic selves, obscuring what they genuinely love or dislike. </li>
<li><strong>Exploration as a Key to Identity and Passion</strong> : The underlying problem to the lack of passion is insufficient life experience. Exploring various aspects of life expands one's horizons and enables an authentic sense of identity, leading to the discovery of true passion. </li>
<li><strong>Iterative Nature of Discovering Passion</strong> : The process of finding one's passion is iterative and requires active discovery through exploring different jobs and experiences, interpreting what one dislikes as important information to guide future choices. </li>
<li><strong>Buffet Analogy for Life Experience</strong> : Life should be approached like a grand buffet, sampling various experiences and jobs to identify true likes and dislikes instead of settling prematurely for a path that may not align with one's authentic self. </li>
<li><strong>Engineer's Self-Discovery</strong> : Through job dissatisfaction, the engineer realizes he prefers interacting with people and dislikes working in large corporate environments, guiding his search for a new job with more collaboration and autonomy. </li>
<li><strong>Life as an Experimentation Buffet</strong> : Viewing career exploration as trying different foods at a buffet, one must pivot away from unenjoyable experiences towards those that fulfill authentic desires. </li>
<li><strong>Iterative Learning from Job Switching</strong> : As one switches jobs to find their passion, each experience, whether positive or negative, provides deeper insight, refining further understanding of personal dislikes and preferences. </li>
<li><strong>Passion as a Solution</strong> : Discovering one's passion can naturally resolve various life issues, reducing stress, and improving motivation, relationships, and overall well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Exploration to Uncover Authentic Self</strong> : To discover one's true self, Leo advocates reading widely, pursuing diverse education, traveling, trying different jobs, meeting new people, and being open to new experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Introspection and Isolation to Reveal Passions</strong> : Key to uncovering one's passion involves spending time alone, reflecting on experiences, and asking deep, introspective questions to align future actions with true interests. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Actualized.org in Finding Passion</strong> : The platform provides resources and encouragement for continual exploration and commitment to finding one's passion through newsletters, insights, and support in mastering personal psychology.</li>
