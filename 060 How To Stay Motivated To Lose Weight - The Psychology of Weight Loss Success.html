<ul>
<li><strong>Personal weight loss experience</strong> : Leo shares that as someone who was once 65 pounds overweight, he used these techniques to successfully lose weight and stay motivated throughout the process. </li>
<li><strong>Initial motivation</strong> : Understanding the core reason for weight loss is crucial to maintaining motivation. It should be a powerful and inspiring reason that highlights the extensive benefits in various areas of life, such as health, relationships, and self-confidence. </li>
<li><strong>Setting inspiring goals</strong> : Leo recommends setting weight-loss goals that are substantial enough to be motivational. Larger goals can often be more incentivizing and impactful than smaller, less noticeable ones. </li>
<li><strong>Vision over goals</strong> : Having a vision rather than just a goal is key. Envisioning detailed, long-term lifestyle changes is more effective than short-term motivations such as events or impressing others. </li>
<li><strong>Creating a vivid picture</strong> : Leo suggests sitting down to clearly visualize and write down the key changes that will occur with weight loss, enhancing motivation through detailed, vivid descriptions of the future. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of sustainment</strong> : He emphasizes the significance of sustaining motivation, requiring consistent reaffirmation of the weight loss vision and adopting habits that are a part of a permanent lifestyle change. </li>
<li><strong>Visualization and affirmations</strong> : Leo advises spending a few minutes daily on visualizing the end goal and using affirmations to reinforce the desired weight and image to program the subconscious mind, aligning it with conscious intentions. </li>
<li><strong>Habit formation challenges</strong> : Reminds listeners that the initial process of forming a habit can be difficult, often taking 30 to 60 days, and requires self-discipline and the understanding that it gets easier with time. </li>
<li><strong>Subconscious mind alignment</strong> : By maintaining a habit and discipline, the subconscious mind becomes more aligned with new behaviors, making it easier to follow through on weight loss actions. </li>
<li><strong>Focus on daily actions</strong> : Stresses the importance of narrowing focus to daily actions, refraining from feeling overwhelmed by the long-term process, and understanding that consistent daily efforts lead to weight loss success. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to lifelong changes</strong> : Leo shares that he made a lifelong commitment to health by changing his relationship with food and exercise permanently and advises others to adopt the same mindset for sustainable results. </li>
<li><strong>Achieving realistic expectations</strong> : He counsels setting realistic weekly weight loss targets and preparing for initial time periods without noticeable changes, emphasizing patience and consistent action for success. </li>
<li><strong>Maintaining motivation and expectations</strong> : Leo advises maintaining motivation by focusing on the long-term benefits and setting reasonable expectations for the rate and timeline of weight loss. </li>
<li><strong>Engaging with actualized.org</strong> : Encourages viewers to engage with his content by sharing their challenges and feedback, to share the video to help others, and to visit his website for more in-depth personal development resources and a free newsletter.</li>
