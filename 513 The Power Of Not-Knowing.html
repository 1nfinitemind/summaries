            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/RMXNQ-nGBSA' target='_blank'>The Power Of Not-Knowing</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Teach thy tongue to say 'I don't know', and thou shalt progress." -<br />
Maimonides<br />
In most situations, the truth is that you simply don't know.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The central theme of not knowing</strong> : Leo enlightens that not knowing is a deep, core topic tied to epistemology. He's been experimenting with and contemplating this subject for years, leading him to illuminate the profound realization that much of what we think we know, we actually do not. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding versus the assumption of understanding</strong> : Leo points out a counterintuitive facet of life where ignorant individuals often believe they understand everything, while the wise are acutely conscious of their knowledge's limits. Society rarely lays bare the fact that our supposed knowledge of fundamental concepts is often a mere presumption. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural constructs versus reality</strong> : Highlighting the constructed and biased nature of knowledge, Leo expresses that societal knowledge often prioritizes survival, sanity, and comfort over the pursuit of profound truth. Our lives are built around conceptual fortresses that are actually fragile, and under scrutiny, can unravel, showing the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging conceptual knowledge through the example of a fork</strong> : Using the example of a fork, Leo encourages a mindful exercise that distinguishes between a 'knowing mode' and a 'not knowing mode' to reveal the conceptual baggage we attach to simple objects. He aims to demonstrate that we don't truly understand even basic objects like a fork, which inherently questions our grasp on more complex aspects of reality. </li>
<li><strong>The limits of scientific knowledge</strong> : He challenges the notion that scientists or intellectuals have comprehensive knowledge, arguing that nobody truly knows what a fork is. This opens up philosophical considerations on the very possibility of knowing and the implications of potentially not knowing everything we interact with daily. </li>
<li><strong>Biased mind and constructed knowledge</strong> : Leo explains that our knowledge is constructed to fit the survival needs of the ego rather than seeking objective truth. The mind creates narratives that skew perception and understanding, which can lead to life problems that people attribute to external factors rather than recognizing their own limited understanding. </li>
<li><strong>The illusion and defense of knowing</strong> : He discusses how individuals and intellectuals create and defend their conceptual fortresses out of the need for survival and sanity, which results in defensiveness when challenged. This protective behavior showcases the fragility of our constructed knowledge and our unwillingness to confront the unknown. </li>
<li><strong>Spin on wisdom and ignorance</strong> : Leo presents the idea that wisdom is not about knowing everything but about recognizing the bounds of one's knowledge. This revelation pushes for a deeper contemplation of what it truly means to understand anything, pinpointing the misalignment between societal knowledge and true knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Valuing truth over being correct</strong> : The paradigm of valuing truth over the comfort of being right is brought forth as a significant factor in personal growth. Leo underlines that admitting ignorance is a step towards seeking genuine truth rather than clinging to potentially incorrect beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of society on knowledge and truth</strong> : Society and cultural conditioning, starting from childhood, obscure the lines between belief systems and objective reality. This has led to programs and ideologies that align more with societal survival and comfort than with truth, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and questioning this conditioning. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom vs. social conditioning</strong> : Wisdom involves understanding the difference between what we've been taught to know and what is actually known through direct experience. Reliance on social conditioning, beliefs, and speculations is often misconceived as knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Demystifying the concept of not knowing</strong> : Leo dissects the theoretical understanding versus the actual experience of not knowing, proposing exercises and shifts in perspective that encourage facing one's ignorance and embracing the uncertainty that comes with it. </li>
<li><strong>Practicing not knowing</strong> : He urges the viewers to experiment with transitioning into an 'unknowing mode' in various aspects of their lives, like business or relationships, to gain new insights and a deeper understanding of reality through directly confronting not knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding the pitfalls of false equivalency and misinformation</strong> : While recognizing the value of not knowing, Leo warns against the dangers of treating all information as equally valid, advising a discerning approach to avoid being misled by misinformation and to apply skepticism wisely in day-to-day life. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing not knowing with practical wisdom</strong> : Emphasizing the balance between philosophical questioning and everyday pragmatism, Leo encourages viewers to contemplate the unknown while still mastering practical applications in life and following their intuition amidst uncertainty. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectual humility and embracing the unknown</strong> : Continuously reminding oneself of the boundaries of our understanding is integral to the practice of not knowing. Leo emphasizes the potential growth from this humility and encourages viewers to test the teachings for themselves to find their own truths. </li>
<li><strong>Programming from Early Education</strong> : Children are heavily programmed with society's survival-oriented knowledge through formal education systems, rarely questioning the alignment of this knowledge with actual truth. </li>
<li><strong>Illusion of Knowing in Society</strong> : Society, including religion, science, history, and media, fosters a facade that mankind possesses extensive knowledge, while the depth of our ignorance is seldom acknowledged. </li>
<li><strong>Science's False Humility About Knowledge</strong> : Despite its claims, science often overestimates its understanding, displaying a false humility and unknowingly contributing to mankind's collective arrogance. </li>
<li><strong>Pressure to Claim Knowledge</strong> : Cultural norms push people to feign knowledge and consider not knowing as a weakness, yet recognizing one's ignorance can often be the most practical approach. </li>
<li><strong>Conformity and Survival Mechanisms</strong> : People typically conform to societal ideas for collective survival, which can lead to self-deception and the dangerous manipulation of abstract concepts like money. </li>
<li><strong>Ignoring Skepticism on Knowledge Possibility</strong> : Ancient skeptics like the Pyronians highlighted the impossibility of true knowledge, yet their arguments were overlooked in favor of knowledge that was pragmatic and instrumental for survival. </li>
<li><strong>Costs of Pragmatic Knowledge</strong> : The pursuit of pragmatic and instrumental knowledge, such as through science and business, incurs significant costs, including closed-mindedness, simplistic narratives, and a loss of connection with being and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Ego Mind's Discomfort with Uncertainty</strong> : The ego constructs narratives and oversimplifies reality to mitigate the discomfort associated with uncertainty, due to reality's inherent infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Mind's Constructive Role in Knowledge</strong> : Acknowledgement of the mind's role in co-creating reality and the entanglement between the mind and the world complicates the pursuit of knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Entanglement of Mind and Knowledge</strong> : The intricate interplay between the mind and reality causes difficulty in discerning what exists independently of perception, making the task of truly knowing anything more complex. </li>
<li><strong>Primordial desire for knowledge</strong> : Reality itself or 'God' has a fundamental desire to know itself, and this primordial urge is evident even in a child's curiosity or a scientist's pursuit. This is not merely trivial but a deep existential matter. Most people, including many scientists and skeptics, deny the possibility that reality wants to know itself, viewing reality as a material system incapable of self-knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Curiosity as a tether to God</strong> : Gura posits that humans are manifestations of reality or 'God', and their inherent curiosity is a thread leading back to the self-realization of being God. However, most people fail to follow this thread of curiosity deep enough to discover ultimate truths, getting lost in deceptions and misguided by others along the way. </li>
<li><strong>Science's quest to understand infinity with finite concepts</strong> : Science attempts to comprehend the universe through finite concepts and narratives, but consistently falls short because it tries to grasp the infinite with the finite. Gura suggests that no matter how much science progresses, it will never fully understand infinity, as infinity cannot be known through a sequence of finite concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Reality's profoundness and the error of science</strong> : Leo Gura declares that reality is too profound to be knowable. This is a fundamental mistake of science and logically-minded individuals who believe they can understand reality through logical reasoning, modeling, and explanation. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectual arrogance and the challenge of admitting ignorance</strong> : Gura addresses the difficulty, especially among those considered knowledgeable like academics, in humbly admitting 'I don't know'. People often prefer protecting their ego and reputation over admitting their misconceptions. He urges the development of courage to confront and accept not knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Encouragement to embrace the state of "I don't know"</strong> : Leo Gura motivates us to stand in uncertainty and explore where admitting "I don't know" can lead. By engaging with uncertainty and the unknown, one can unearth insights and depth of understanding that were previously unimaginable. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of knowing and not knowing</strong> : Gura acknowledges the apparent contradiction of emphasizing 'not knowing' while appearing to claim understanding of divine and infinite concepts. He promises to address this paradox further in the lecture, hinting at the necessity to do some foundational work to reconcile this conflict. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Practicing Not-Knowing</strong> : Leo suggests that instead of just repeating information from other sources, individuals should actively practice introspection to embody a genuine state of not-knowing, recognizing its depth compared to second-hand knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Distinction Between Theory and State of Not-Knowing</strong> : Leo makes a clear distinction between understanding the theory of not-knowing, which is more intellectual, and being in an actual state of not-knowing, which is experiential and requires practice. </li>
<li><strong>Guided Exercise for Not-Knowing</strong> : Leo leads a guided visualization exercise where participants erase the past, future, and current preconceptions to achieve a state of profound not-knowing, akin to the experience of a newborn. </li>
<li><strong>Contrasting States of Knowing and Not-Knowing</strong> : Participants are encouraged to contrast how they usually operate with a backdrop of knowledge against the genuine state of not-knowing reached in the exercise. </li>
<li><strong>Addressing Scientific and Religious Worldviews</strong> : Leo challenges individuals with scientific and religious backgrounds to let go of their foundational beliefs and genuinely embrace a state of not-knowing, highlighting the difficulty in doing so. </li>
<li><strong>Resisting Ego and Embracing Uncertainty</strong> : Leo points out the ego's resistance to releasing deeply ingrained beliefs like the existence of Earth, and encourages persistent practice in embracing not-knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Wiping the Slate Clean</strong> : He advises periodically wiping the slate clean of all worldviews and beliefs to create space for new insights, understanding, and potentially, personal awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Emptying the Cup for Potential Insight</strong> : Leo illustrates the benefit of not knowing, how it creates space for new insights to emerge, thus stressing the importance of emptying one's cup of prior convictions to allow for genuine discovery and awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Exercise for Embracing Uncertainty</strong> : Leo encourages writing down 10 things that one claims to know but actually does not know. This exercise involves intensely introspecting and admitting ignorance in areas we usually take for granted or think we understand. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of Claimed Knowledge to Question</strong> : Leo provides examples like the age of the Earth, the health benefits of fish oil, the existence of Jesus, and the consciousness of others as knowledge claims to reevaluate honestly. It's about facing the raw truth and admitting "I don't know." </li>
<li><strong>Truth vs. Posturing</strong> : The exercise highlights the difference between genuinely knowing something versus posturing or pretending to know. Leo urges viewers to catch themselves in the act of posturing and to admit it candidly. </li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Admitting Ignorance</strong> : Admitting that one might not know something they've believed for years, like the beneficial effects of fish oil or even whether one truly loves their family, requires deep honesty and can be psychologically difficult. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Forgiveness in Self-Deception</strong> : Upon realizing one's self-deception and posturing, Leo stresses the importance of forgiving oneself, recognizing that misguided beliefs often stem from survival instincts and a lack of awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Belief and Hearsay vs. Direct Experience</strong> : Leo distinguishes between knowledge based on belief or hearsay and knowledge grounded in direct experience. He emphasizes that hearsay, while sometimes accurate, has not been verified personally and may actually be incorrect. </li>
<li><strong>Conceptual Knowledge as Second Order</strong> : Leo explains that conceptual knowledge is a second-order abstraction that avoids confronting the direct, first-order existence of an entity. He emphasizes that existence and being precede knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>The Informational Frailty of Second Order Knowledge</strong> : Leo makes clear that second-order knowledge is relative, finite, and easily uprooted by new information or recontextualization, which underscores the importance of seeking first-order experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Mysticism and the Inherent Mystery of Being</strong> : Lastly, Leo connects the concept of not knowing to mysticism, explaining that reality as a first-order, infinite phenomenon cannot be fully grasped by second-order knowing, thus maintaining an inherent and irreducible mystery. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Regression and Knowledge</strong> : Leo highlights that knowledge itself is being&mdash;every form of knowing is an experience with its own being. Knowledge about something, like a fork, points to the being of that object, layering one being onto another, creating an infinite stepping back process as reality observes itself. This process is akin to the concept of going meta, emphasizing infinity as an endless regression into itself. </li>
<li><strong>Conflation of Being and Knowing</strong> : Upon deeper contemplation, Leo states that the distinction between metaphysics and epistemology collapses in a state of not knowing. At the deepest level, all knowing is essentially being, and profound knowledge is equivalent to being. He explains that entities are understood not by thinking but by existing and being&mdash;the core of meditation, self-inquiry, and psychedelic experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening as Profound Not-Knowing</strong> : Leo describes awakening as a shift from knowing to being, where sensory experiences become the means of knowledge. This direct form of understanding transcends the intellectual and conceptual, allowing someone to know a fork by becoming the fork, exceeding mere thought-based knowledge vastly. </li>
<li><strong>Direct Experience Instead of Descriptive Knowledge</strong> : Leo criticizes academia's reliance on descriptive knowledge, contrasting it with the concept of knowing through direct experience. He imagines an intelligence so great that it could think in forms rather than descriptions, enabling a perfect understanding without the limitations of language or interpretation. </li>
<li><strong>Omniscience as First-Order Being</strong> : Challenging the common conception of omniscience as conceptual all-knowingness, Leo explains true omniscience as the realization of imagination within one's mind. It's not about knowing every fact at the second-order level but recognizing that all perceptions, including the count of kangaroos in Australia, are constructs of the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Integrating Omniscience in Personal Development</strong> : Leo asserts the importance of reaching a state of complete not knowing, recognizing the futility of trying to grasp infinity through second-order thinking. He mentions the physical and mental toll of trying to intellectually figure out reality and stresses the need to satisfy the primordial curiosity of knowing one's true self, which cannot be fulfilled by partial insights from science, religion, or philosophy. </li>
<li><strong>Illusion of Complete Understanding</strong> : Leo Gura criticizes the superficial and temporary satisfactions provided by science and various teachings, comparing them to light physical tickling. He emphasizes the distinction between this limited engagement with knowledge and the profound experience of a full-blown awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Reality and Awakening</strong> : He contends that to grasp the true essence of reality, one must experience an awakening, which provides a genuine relief and a satisfying peace that simplified or intellectualized methods fail to deliver. </li>
<li><strong>Relative vs. Absolute Truth</strong> : Leo revisits the topic of relative versus absolute truth, explaining that conventional knowledge (e.g., knowing a fork in relation to other objects) is relative. In contrast, true, absolute knowledge requires an awakening&mdash;one must become what they seek to understand, like becoming the fork, rather than just acquiring information about it. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and the State of Not Knowing</strong> : He argues that psychedelics can catalyze profound states of not knowing, revealing the fragility of our relative knowledge and the existence of an alternative form of absolute knowledge. Leo expresses concern over the closed-mindedness of intellectuals towards psychedelics due to their potential to deconstruct established knowledge systems. </li>
<li><strong>Deconstruction and Not Knowing</strong> : Leo highlights the mutual reinforcement between the process of deconstruction and the state of not knowing. He recommends his own content discussing deconstruction for a deeper understanding of the concept and its role in exploring the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Peter Ralston's Influence</strong> : Leo gives credit to Peter Ralston, whose work on the concept of not knowing deeply influenced him and has grown to be a significant part of his understanding over the past year. </li>
<li><strong>Not Knowing and Mature Minds</strong> : He observes that mature minds are more willing to admit their lack of knowledge, ironically resulting in the potential to know the profound (e.g., the nature of reality, God, consciousness) in an absolute manner, a feat deemed impossible by less mature, knowledge-laden minds. </li>
<li><strong>Using Not Knowing Thoughtfully</strong> : While advocating for the practice of not knowing, Leo also cautions against letting it derail one's life or devolve into epistemic nihilism. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining healthy living principles alongside exploring states of not knowing. </li>
<li><strong>Conflicts Between Truth Pursuit and Survival</strong> : Leo reflects on the tension between pursuing truth&mdash;which involves questioning and deconstructing worldviews&mdash;and ensuring survival. The aim is to enhance and purify survival, despite the inherent risks of such an endeavor. </li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic Nature of Survival Decisions</strong> : Leo describes choosing a career path based on passion and probability of success. He gives an example of deciding between musician, filmmaker, and accountant, and advocates for decisive action even when certainty isn't absolute, emphasizing the importance of picking the best option with the information at hand. </li>
<li><strong>Dangers of Misusing 'Not Knowing'</strong> : Leo warns against using 'not knowing' to justify skepticism about everything, including topics like the existence of God, what happens after death, or vaccine safety. He differentiates between absolute and relative knowledge, particularly in urgent survival situations where decisions must be made swiftly despite imperfect information. </li>
<li><strong>Not Falling for False Equivalency</strong> : He discusses how 'not knowing' can be exploited, such as equating wisdom with foolishness or experience with inexperience. Leo highlights the necessity of discernment to avoid the pitfalls of conspiracy theories, ideology, and gaslighting by malicious actors in politics and society. </li>
<li><strong>Being Decisive and Educated</strong> : Asserting that 'not knowing' should not be an excuse for ignorance, Leo encourages still pursuing education, reading, and consuming quality content. He cautions against replacing self-improvement endeavors with activities like scrolling social media or indulging in vices, which might be temptations when one abandons purpose and direction. </li>
<li><strong>Application of 'Not Knowing' in Everyday Life</strong> : Leo suggests that we maintain healthy habits and not allow the concept of 'not knowing' to derail our self-actualization journey. He recommends first deconstructing detrimental beliefs before questioning foundational aspects of life like career or family to avoid extremism. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Pressures and the 'Need to Know'</strong> : Leo illustrates how daily responsibilities create pressure to 'know' and act, leaving little room for indulging in 'not knowing'. This survival pressure makes the concept unpopular as people face the metaphorical 'gun to the head' compelling them to know and act on that knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Mastery Versus Philosophical 'Not Knowing'</strong> : He elucidates the paradox that one can master practical skills and make accurate predictions without knowing what the objects used (like a fork) truly are at a metaphysical level. The focus should be on practical use rather than getting lost in philosophical ponderings that inhibit effective action. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Leo's Teachings and Knowledge</strong> : Leo reflects on his awareness of the partial and relative nature of knowledge. He acknowledges his teachings are practical and sometimes intentionally non-metaphysical to be useful, and he continually questions and deconstructs his own models and worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Construct Awareness and Relativity of Knowledge</strong> : Speaking about the pragmatism in his advice, Leo notes that while he tries to make his teachings practical, he remains aware of their relative and perspectival nature. He aspires to achieve a balance between constructive intellectual work and the process of deconstructing previous understandings. </li>
<li><strong>Admission of Reality's Infinitude</strong> : Concluding, Leo states his fundamental knowledge is the understanding of reality as infinite, suggesting that even with the vast array of relative, contextual knowledge, what ultimately matters is this insight of infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Infinity as a foundational understanding</strong> : Leo acknowledges that while the specific details within the concept of infinity can be fallible, infinity itself is what not-knowing ultimately leads towards. He considers this as the core of understanding, with everything else being contingent knowledge prone to self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>Intuition's role in life choices</strong> : Leo discusses the power of intuition and listening to one's heart, suggesting it's less about explicit knowing and more about feeling. Our spirit or soul is drawn to aspects of infinity, and our task is to honor and follow that attraction like a beacon or compass. </li>
<li><strong>Conscience and ethical intuition</strong> : He asserts that most people possess an inherent conscience that allows them to intuitively understand right from wrong. This spiritual aspect guides actions and reinforces our connection with infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Trust in intuition</strong> : Leo advocates trusting your intuition, despite its imperfection, as your best tool for navigating life. However, he acknowledges that intuition is fallible and one can still be deceived by it. </li>
<li><strong>Life forcing imperfect choices</strong> : Leo argues that life necessitates making imperfect decisions based on trial and error. Personal suffering and experiences teach us what is not working, leading to better life choices. </li>
<li><strong>Testing principles for a good life</strong> : He challenges listeners to try their own theories of what constitutes a good life, such as unhealthy habits versus disciplined practices. Feelings of suffering and depression can quickly indicate whether a chosen lifestyle is fulfilling or not. </li>
<li><strong>Applying 'Not knowing'</strong> : Leo calls for deep contemplation of the limits of knowing and encourages questioning everything. He also suggests working towards entering states of 'not knowing' and using psychedelics for deeper exploration, with safety precautions in place. </li>
<li><strong>Resisting societal pressure to know</strong> : Leo advises having the courage to admit ignorance in various settings like work and school, advocating an appreciation for mystery. </li>
<li><strong>Practicing uncertainty</strong> : He suggests frequently asserting "I don't know" to save time and avoid superfluous debates or discussions based on speculation. </li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing belief from experience</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of differentiating between beliefs and direct experience, wiping the slate clean regarding personal worldviews from time to time. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing not knowing with action</strong> : He encourages maintaining action and deep intuition when embracing not knowing and suggests applying this mindset prior to engaging in various activities such as meditation, brainstorming, communication, and listening to controversial perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Improvised responding instead of over-planning</strong> : Leo recommends applying 'not knowing' in everyday situations to encourage an improvisational approach to life, whether it be in business, dating, or investing, where preconceived expectations are released for a more authentic and present experience. </li>
<li><strong>Applying "Not Knowing" in Workplace Dynamics</strong> : Leo suggests that instead of assuming negative intentions of others at work, such as jealousy or scheming, one could embrace "not knowing" and consider alternative explanations for their behavior, leading to better communication and problem-solving. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing Reality's Uncertainty</strong> : He highlights the unpredictable nature of events such as economic shifts, political changes, or new health crises. Leo emphasizes the value in becoming comfortable with life's inherent uncertainty, rather than fabricating stories for reassurance. </li>
<li><strong>Greater Effectiveness Through Less Expectations</strong> : By acknowledging "not knowing," one can reduce fantasies and assumptions, leading to more effective operation from a position of presence and improvisation, enhancing responsiveness in real-time situations. </li>
<li><strong>Improvisation in Social Interactions</strong> : Leo advises against scripting interactions, like conversations when meeting someone new. He claims that an improvisational approach, without pre-planned scripts, results in more authentic and responsive communication. </li>
<li><strong>Transition to Presence and Responsiveness</strong> : Leo shares his personal transition from pre-planning everything for security to adopting an improvisational mindset. He asserts that such a transition can take time but ultimately leads to a more enjoyable and flow-state living. </li>
<li><strong>Admitting Ignorance as a Safety Mechanism</strong> : Leo urges listeners to admit when they do not know the veracity of his teachings to prevent turning them into dogma. He discusses the importance of testing his advanced concepts for oneself, considering personal life circumstances, age, country, gender, genetics, and mental health conditions. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Personal Truth and Openness to Higher Truths</strong> : He encourages viewers to remain true to their present understanding, while also being open to future recontextualization of beliefs. Being cautious about prematurely accepting claims without direct personal experience and realizing one's current truth may be a partial view of a larger picture.</li>
