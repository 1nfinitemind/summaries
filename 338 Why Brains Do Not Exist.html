            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5N9xARPfJYY' target='_blank'>Why Brains Do Not Exist</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Existence is anecdotal."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The problem with the materialist paradigm</strong> : Leo describes the materialist belief in the physical brain as a significant obstacle to understanding deeper consciousness work. Materialists are stuck on the idea that everything is happening inside the brain, which hinders grasping advanced metaphysical concepts. </li>
<li><strong>First-person experiences misconceived as hallucinations</strong> : Materialists often discount spiritual and mystical experiences as unreliable hallucinations, comparing them to the subjective realities of people with mental disorders. They argue for reliance on science for objective truths, contradicting the significance of first-person experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Materialists' implicit metaphysics unexamined</strong> : Leo points out that materialists assume the existence of a brain and an external physical reality without questioning these underlying metaphysical beliefs. The materialist's metaphysics, when closely examined, reveals inherent absurdities and contradictions. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of observing a brain</strong> : When materialists observe a brain within a skull, they fail to recognize that this is merely a first-person experience of seeing pink flesh, not proof of the brain's metaphysical existence. Materialistic assumptions lack a proper foundation as they build on unverified metaphysical substrates. </li>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning in materialist belief</strong> : The materialist's assertion that first-person appearances occur in the brain cannot escape circular reasoning, as the brain itself is a conceptual construct based on first-person appearances without empirical evidence for a separate metaphysical reality. </li>
<li><strong>Science built on subjective experiences</strong> : Leo emphasizes that all scientific knowledge is ultimately rooted in first-person experiences, yet science divides this into seemingly objective third-person facts using consensus, overlooking that this consensus is still comprised of subjective experiences. </li>
<li><strong>No empirical evidence for an external world</strong> : The materialist view assumes an external world where all experiences and the brain exist; however, Leo argues there is no empirical proof for this external reality. Everything, including the skeptic's stance, is based on subjective, anecdotal evidence. </li>
<li><strong>Existence and universe as anecdotal</strong> : The materialist critique of the subjectivity of mystical experiences overlooks the fact that all beliefs about existence and the universe are also anecdotal; they are only "real" because of first-person experiences. Reality is misunderstood as non-conceptual, ignoring its foundation in subjective perception. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of materialist assumptions</strong> : Leo warns that the materialist paradigm, which sees the brain and the universe as objective, impedes recognition of a significantly deeper understanding of reality. It confines one's perspective to what is conceptualized rather than acknowledging the direct manifestations of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Central Dependence of Existence</strong> : Leo argues that everything, including the Big Bang, hinges on one's own existence. He proposes a substantial paradigm shift by suggesting that instead of us depending on the Big Bang, it relies on our existence, challenging the common materialist perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysics Dismissed as Nonsense</strong> : Leo criticizes the common societal dismissal of metaphysics as irrelevant or nonsensical, especially by scientists who claim that they've abandoned such discussions. He clarifies that even the belief in hard objective facts is inherently a metaphysical stance. </li>
<li><strong>Materialism as Cultural Indoctrination</strong> : Leo observes that modern culture indoctrinates individuals into the materialist paradigm without presenting it as one possible perspective, making it more insidious than explicit religious indoctrination. Questioning this paradigm risks being mocked or labeled as crazy. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as Hallucination</strong> : He defines reality, including his own presence and voice, as a hallucination. Leo deliberately uses the term "hallucination" to describe appearances without substance, suggesting that there is nothing beyond these perceptions; no brains, physical matter, or laws acting behind the scenes. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions About Hallucinations</strong> : Addressing the skepticism towards his notion of hallucination, Leo differentiates between different types of hallucinations. He argues that hallucinations, regardless of being fantastical or realistic, can be governed by their own set of logical rules. </li>
<li><strong>The Limitation of Paradigms on Imagination</strong> : Leo argues that a person's fundamental paradigm or set of beliefs severely limits their ability to imagine realities outside of that frame, leading to a dismissal of concepts that don't fit within their perceived constraints, like ghosts for a materialist. </li>
<li><strong>Location of Hallucinations and Paradigm Break</strong> : Questioning the location of these hallucinations, Leo refutes the materialist's suggestion that hallucinations occur in the brain or a simulated reality, positing that the hard reality of appearances happening in the brain or physical substratum is a mere assumption. </li>
<li><strong>Comparison with Historical Scientific Fallacies</strong> : Leo equates the belief in a brain or physical reality to outdated scientific concepts like luminiferous ether, phlogiston, caloric, and miasma. These were once held to explain phenomena but were ultimately deemed unnecessary. </li>
<li><strong>Rejecting the Need for a Physical Substratum</strong> : Leo suggests that just as scientific understanding evolved past the need for ether or miasma, it's possible to conceive that appearances do not need a physical substratum. The challenge lies in relinquishing the deeply ingrained materialist paradigm. </li>
<li><strong>Materialist Paradigm Compared to Religious Fundamentalism</strong> : He compares the staunch adherence to the materialist paradigm to religious fundamentalism, stating that materialists are fundamentalists to their belief in a physical reality and brain, which they are reluctant to question or abandon. </li>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Paradigm Shift</strong> : Leo acknowledges the difficulty in shifting away from the materialist paradigm, asserting that it's not enough to intellectually agree to drop physicalist beliefs; it would take a significant experiential shift to truly abandon materialistic fundamentalism. </li>
<li><strong>Comparison of the Brain to Religious Gods</strong> : Leo suggests that like religious people have their versions of God, materialists treat the brain as their "God". He claims there's no proof for the brain or an external reality, and that believing in such is taken on blind faith. </li>
<li><strong>Ideological Positions of the Mind</strong> : Leo critiques atheists and scientifically minded people for underestimating the mind's capacity for holding ideological positions. He argues that many hold deep-seated ideological beliefs without realizing it, much like religious superstitions but simply with different content. </li>
<li><strong>Consistency of First-Person Experience</strong> : The reason for materialistic belief, according to Leo, is the consistent solidity of first-person experiences. However, he contends that this perceived consistency is an illusion which can be broken through methods like psychedelics, intense meditation, or sensory deprivation. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Indoctrination into Materialism</strong> : Leo talks about being born into a materialist culture, comparing it to religious indoctrination. He suggests that due to deep cultural indoctrination, most people find it difficult to conceive of a reality that is not materialistic. </li>
<li><strong>Inquiry into the Substance of Reality</strong> : Leo posits that considering reality to have a physical substrate that grounds appearances leads to an infinite regress. He encourages questioning what grounds reality itself, emphasizing that weirdness, absurdity, and paradox are features of ultimate metaphysical questions, not bugs. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Grounding of Reality as Nothingness</strong> : Leo states that reality, including the brain, is appearances within nothingness, not within space, time, or dimensions. He claims that the idea of the Big Bang or anything beyond it doesn't explain the source of appearances, which instead suggests an infinite hallucination. </li>
<li><strong>Brain Damage Argument</strong> : Addressing the brain damage argument, Leo agrees that damaging the brain affects appearances but argues this does not prove appearances are happening inside the brain. Rather he maintains the brain is simply an interactive appearance within the hallucinatory system of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as a Self-Interactive System</strong> : He explains that reality, being a collection of interconnected appearances, is inherently a self-interactive system, with phenomena like billiard ball collisions or atomic interactions exemplifying this concept. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of the Brain in Experience</strong> : While acknowledging the brain's role in shaping our experiences, Leo clarifies that its importance doesn't establish it as the metaphysical substrate of appearance. He reinforces the idea of keeping the brain safe, as it is a significant interactive component in reality. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Substances on Perceptions</strong> : Leo counters the argument that drugs altering perception proves a physical brain cause by stating that liquor or drugs are appearances that affect the brain's appearances, which then alters other appearances, maintaining the consistency of reality as a system of appearances. </li>
<li><strong>Hallucinatory nature of reality</strong> : Leo contends reality is composed of interconnected appearances that interact in complex ways, yet this does not validate the existence of these appearances within a brain. </li>
<li><strong>The brain's role in generating appearances</strong> : He states that the evolution of the brain is significant for creating the richness of human consciousness compared to less complex beings, emphasizing the brain's role in the intricate self-interactive system that generates our experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Magical nature of existence</strong> : Leo proposes that reality is 'magical,' meaning existence is uncaused and mystical, with no underlying mechanism generating appearances&mdash;they manifest directly. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of physics</strong> : He distinguishes between physical laws, which govern a portion of reality, and the nature of existence, which is not confined to these laws, implying reality is unlimited and not subjected to physical constraints. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysics and science</strong> : Leo argues that while science is adept at explaining physical phenomena, it does not and cannot address the metaphysical question of being&mdash;it operates under undeclared metaphysical assumptions, primarily materialism. </li>
<li><strong>Science's never-ending discovery</strong> : He suggests that, despite continuous scientific progress, there will always be an infinite number of appearances and science will never answer the fundamental question of their existence, highlighting the gap between empirical study and metaphysical inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Materialism and magical thinking</strong> : Leo critiques the materialistic approach's rejection of 'magical thinking,' explaining that even as science demystifies certain phenomena, it fails to address the existence of phenomena and will always require a mystical source for reality. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as direct manifestation</strong> : He suggests considering an alternative where reality is the mechanism itself&mdash;the direct manifestation of appearances&mdash;and there's no distinction between existence and consciousness of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Inherent mysticism of reality</strong> : Leo asserts that the simplest and most direct explanation of reality is through mysticism and magic&mdash;everything is directly manifested, negating the need for an external reality or substratum. </li>
<li><strong>Demystifying nature's pitfalls</strong> : He warns that the materialist approach to demystify nature leads to a loss of understanding of reality's essence, as materialism cannot accommodate the concept of the mystical and uncaused nature of being. </li>
<li><strong>Materialist Metaphysics as a Straitjacket</strong> : Leo criticizes the materialistic worldview for being too rigid, rejecting the existence of subtler, immaterial aspects of reality. This, he says, leads to closed-mindedness and prevents exploration of phenomena that go beyond the physical. </li>
<li><strong>Limited Understanding</strong> : Leo argues that adherents of materialism are trapped within their paradigm and fail to recognize or explore anything beyond the material world, labeling other potential levels of consciousness as nonexistent. </li>
<li><strong>Hallucination as Immaterial Reality</strong> : He asserts that all of reality is immaterial, equating material and immaterial phenomena with hallucinations, thereby challenging the division between what's considered material and immaterial. </li>
<li><strong>Rejection of the Paranormal</strong> : According to Leo, when topics like past lives, out-of-body experiences, and immortality are presented to a materialist, they are dismissed as nonsense, which he argues is a consequence of the constraints of a materialist mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Open Investigation vs. Superstition</strong> : He encourages a genuine and open investigation into these unconventional phenomena, distinguishing between being open to possibility and gullibly believing in every claim. </li>
<li><strong>Fear-Based Objections to Mysticism</strong> : Leo indicates that the fear of superstition or engaging with the 'paranormal' is not rooted in a quest for truth but rather in an aversion to believing in something potentially false. </li>
<li><strong>Exploring Beyond Materialism</strong> : He suggests that by being open to new paradigms and exploring topics considered beyond material understanding, one can experience personal growth and gain a broader understanding of spirituality and immaterial truths. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Development and Escaping Materialism</strong> : Leo highlights that by questioning the materialistic paradigm, people can perform powerful self-development work and eventually experience a profound shift in their understanding of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Discovering the Illusion of Materialism</strong> : He implores the audience to explore and discover that the materialist paradigm is flawed and to realize that existence is more mystical than they currently perceive. </li>
<li><strong>Dropping the 'Brain God'</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to abandon the notion that experiences occur within a brain, promoting the idea of existence as a hallucination arising from nothingness, which leads to a more profound perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Enlightenment Journey Documentation</strong> : Leo invites viewers to accompany him on his documented journey towards enlightenment on Actualized.org, providing an opportunity to observe and possibly participate in a transformational process. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation and Growth Emphasis</strong> : He predicts a radical change in himself within the next five years and encourages viewers to actively participate in their self-development to avoid falling behind in understanding his advanced teachings.</li>
