            <ul>
    <li><b>Enlightenment's practical impact</b>: It profoundly changed Leo's life, particularly in how he related to himself and life but did not alter basic human functions or daily tasks like cooking.
</li><li><b>Acceleration of personal growth</b>: Following enlightenment, Leo experienced rapid personal expansion and subsequent enlightenments, leading to a swift change in his career trajectory from medicine to consciousness work.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and fear of change</b>: Leo mentions that individuals often fear enlightenment will force them to change their careers or leave their relationships, but he assures that such fears are unfounded.
</li><li><b>Choice after enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment allows individuals to choose their paths willingly, rather than imposing changes upon them, and it can enable them to perform their activities better and with a new perspective.
</li><li><b>Misconception about asceticism</b>: Leo clarifies that the stereotype of needing to adopt an ascetic lifestyle after enlightenment is a misunderstanding, noting that such practices are tools to reach enlightenment, not the result of it.
</li>
