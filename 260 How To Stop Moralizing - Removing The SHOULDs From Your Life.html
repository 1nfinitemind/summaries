            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/eg7us76XBEQ' target='_blank'>How To Stop Moralizing - Removing The SHOULDs From Your Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Should Statements</strong> : Leo highlights that common 'should' statements impact our quality of life, causing feelings like guilt, shame, bitterness, and blame, and he suggests that eliminating these can lead to happier lives. </li>
<li><strong>Backstory to Illuminate Moralism</strong> : Leo recounts an experience with an ex-girlfriend who was heavily influenced by moralistic 'should' statements from her mother, leading to a constrained and unhappy life, highlighting the negative effects of rigid beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Should Statements</strong> : Leo defines 'should' statements as directives we tell ourselves or hear from others about what we ought to do or not do and proposes that these often well-intentioned rules can be more limiting than helpful. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of Common Should Statements</strong> : He lists typical 'should' and 'shouldn't' statements, such as "People should be nice to me," or "I should not be lazy," illustrating how pervasive these statements are in our daily lives. </li>
<li><strong>The Magical Insight</strong> : Leo's central theme is the radical notion of stopping the use of 'should' statements, emphasizing that it is not a 'should' but an option for living a more liberated life. </li>
<li><strong>The Problem with Should Statements</strong> : He explains that 'should' statements are grounded in our ego and survival instincts, which skew our perception of reality and create unnecessary resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Reality vs. Expectation</strong> : Leo stresses that reality is precisely how it should be, no matter our personal preferences or societal norms, and advises us to accept reality rather than resist it. </li>
<li><strong>Childhood Indoctrination of Shoulds</strong> : He discusses how from childhood, we are taught what we should and shouldn't do, leading to a black-and-white mindset that seldom aligns with the complexities of real life. </li>
<li><strong>Reassessing Moral Foundations</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to critically reassess the origin and validity of their moralistic beliefs and rules, implying that many of these are arbitrarily created rather than grounded in absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Living Over Simplistic Rules</strong> : He advocates for a nuanced approach to life that requires conscious assessment of situations rather than adherence to oversimplified, rigid rules. </li>
<li><strong>The Arbitrary Nature of Societal Rules</strong> : Leo suggests that many societal norms and moral imperatives are arbitrarily constructed and should not be accepted unquestionably, promoting a flexible and conscious reevaluation of these norms. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning the Origin of Rules</strong> : Leo explains the need to deeply question where the "should" statements we adopt come from and gives examples, such as questioning why one believes their business "should" be making more money. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Ancient Philosophies</strong> : He discusses how Confucianism in Asian cultures and Islam in the Middle East have profoundly influenced current societal norms, pointing out that these often unquestioned norms take on the force of law in people's lives. </li>
<li><strong>Reassessing Cultural Norms</strong> : Leo urges listeners to reassess long-standing cultural norms that mandate behaviors and values, suggesting that even deeply rooted beliefs such as family loyalty should be open to questioning. </li>
<li><strong>Flipping "Should" Statements</strong> : Leo encourages flipping "should" statements to their opposite to uncover underlying resistances and realize the nuanced reality of life's situations. </li>
<li><strong>Living in a Gray Scale Universe</strong> : He promotes abandoning the black-and-white, moralistic model of the universe and embracing a gray-scale one that acknowledges complexity and the relativity of "should" statements. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming the Fantasy of "Should" Statements</strong> : Leo argues that insisting on "should" statements is often rooted in fear and insecurity, contrasting this with the self-assuredness of a self-actualized individual who does not need rigid rules. </li>
<li><strong>Realism vs. Cartoon Reality</strong> : By presenting flipped versions of common "should" statements, Leo demonstrates that our expectations are frequently disconnected from the complexities of reality, leading to oversimplified and unrealistic perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Accepting Bitter Truths</strong> : He challenges listeners to accept difficult truths, like the possibility of being treated poorly or cheated on, explaining that these realities exist and our attitudes toward them do not change that fact. </li>
<li><strong>Confronting Denial and Hypocrisy</strong> : Leo confronts the listeners' potential denial and hypocrisy, especially when it comes to expecting behavior from others (like children not doing drugs) that does not align with reality. </li>
<li><strong>The Sole Proof of Reality</strong> : Finally, Leo emphasizes that the only proof of what should occur is what actually happens in reality, dismissing fantasies and opinions of "should" as mere illusions. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance of Imperfection</strong> : Leo explains that "should" statements create an idealized image of perfection that is not aligned with reality. He suggests redefining perfection to match reality and thereby avoiding the frustration of unmet expectations. </li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Obligation</strong> : "Should" statements, Leo argues, cause us to act out of obligation rather than desire, leading to resistance, motivation problems, and a lack of personal integrity. </li>
<li><strong>Reality vs. Ideal Expectations</strong> : Leo highlights the discrepancy between an idealized version of reality and the actual reality that causes bitterness and guilt. He advocates eliminating such expectations to alleviate these negative emotions. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance Reinforces Problems</strong> : He explains that resisting temptations due to moral obligations often reinforces and submerges the issue in the subconscious, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Dropping 'Should' Statements</strong> : Leo invites the audience to envision a life without 'should' statements, leading to a non-moralizing yet effective and rational approach to problems, including serious issues like terrorism. </li>
<li><strong>Reactions to Real World Problems</strong> : Leo clarifies that dropping 'should' statements does not condone harmful behaviors but promotes an understanding and common-sense reaction to issues such as terrorism. </li>
<li><strong>Redefined Evil and Wrongness</strong> : Leo challenges the concept of evil and wrong as constructs of the human ego and invites viewers to reflect on the fact that judgments of right and wrong are based on personal bias rather than objective reality. </li>
<li><strong>Natural Desires vs. Moralistic Ideals</strong> : Leo asserts that life is about following natural desires rather than moralistic ideals. He suggests that moralistic ideals can repress desires, which in turn can lead to negative outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Changing Perspective on Laziness</strong> : Leo contends that true motivation emerges from embracing desires rather than following 'should' directives, which he blames for feelings of laziness and the lack of progress. </li>
<li><strong>Authentic Desires Over 'Should' Statements</strong> : Leo explains that letting go of 'should' statements allows individuals to connect with their authentic desires, leading to passionate, high-quality motivations that improve personal effectiveness effortlessly. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of Changing Paradigms</strong> : He addresses potential misconceptions about his message, clarifying that he's not promoting a new set of 'shoulds' but advocating for a shift to self-acceptance and a move away from moralistic paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Making Reality Better</strong> : Leo advocates for accepting reality first, then acting on authentic desires to facilitate positive change, like ending slavery or combating harmful ideologies, without leaning on moralistic judgments. </li>
<li><strong>Raising Emotionally Mature Kids</strong> : In parenting, Leo suggests educating children on consequences and implications of actions rather than imposing rigid 'should' commands, fostering their ability to make informed and conscious decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Intent Behind 'Should' Statements</strong> : Emphasizes that the problem is not the word 'should' itself, but the moralistic and absolute beliefs that often accompany its use. True change comes from eliminating the belief in moral imperatives behind 'should' statements. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Decision-Making over Rule Following</strong> : Leo encourages listeners to empower themselves and others to live more consciously and make wise decisions unencumbered by rigid rules and should statements. </li>
<li><strong>Authentic Desire Leads to Real Change</strong> : He explains that embracing one's genuine desire to be healthy, as opposed to being bound by obligations, leads to natural and effortless choices that align with that desire, such as avoiding unhealthy foods or going to the gym. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Victim Mentality and Acknowledging Consequences</strong> : Leo cautions against using his teachings as an excuse for victim mentality or to avoid consequences, and stresses that removing justifications from actions promotes authenticity and personal responsibility. </li>
<li><strong>Destiny vs. Freedom</strong> : Leo argues that knowing whether or not to go to work cannot be pre-determined; whether it 'should' happen will be known only when the moment arrives. This highlights a concept of freedom rather than destiny, where you trust your desires and act accordingly. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Rules</strong> : He warns that a rigid framework of rules is not an ideal approach. If the only thing preventing negative behavior is a strict rule, one might not be ready for a freer paradigm that requires trust in one's intuitive desires. </li>
<li><strong>Readiness for Advanced Techniques</strong> : Leo urges caution with his advice, noting that some may not yet be ready to drop certain societal or moral rules, especially if these rules are the only deterrents from harmful actions. </li>
<li><strong>Growth and Mindfulness Required</strong> : Implementing the proposed paradigm shift requires personal growth, consciousness, self-awareness, and a trusting relationship with one's desires, as opposed to following externally imposed rules. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Steps for Applying New Concepts</strong> : Leo advises against abruptly dismissing all rules; instead, he recommends beginning with awareness and then gradually questioning and experimenting with less critical rules. </li>
<li><strong>Handling High-Stakes Rules</strong> : For more important rules, Leo suggests caution and not experimenting rashly, as the consequences could be significant and lead to regrettable outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Building Self-Trust in Stages</strong> : He encourages starting with less consequential rules to build confidence in one's ability to trust their own judgment, suggesting a gradual progression towards full self-trust and freedom. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing Authentic Desires</strong> : Leo asserts that learning to trust oneself is a gradual process that begins with acknowledging authentic feelings and desires instead of adhering to rules that may not align with one's genuine self. </li>
<li><strong>Releasing and Training the Self</strong> : The process, as described by Leo, is analogous to rewilding a domesticated horse&mdash;teaching oneself to function authentically and naturally, without the coercion of rules. </li>
<li><strong>Assignment of Counter-Should Exercise</strong> : Leo asks viewers to write down their top 50 'should' statements, flip them, and observe the resulting resistance and emotions, encouraging mindfulness about how these statements affect their daily behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment and Truth</strong> : Concluding his lecture, Leo links the shift in paradigm to enlightenment, suggesting that this perspective comes from seeing reality clearly, without the distortion of the ego, and that it has practical, everyday benefits.</li>
