        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/23gbVOoRbtA' target='_blank'>I'm Leaving To Pursue Awakening & Healing - March 2020</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's deepest awakening</strong> : Leo describes his recent awakening as the most profound he has ever experienced, which requires him to radically change his entire life. He emphasizes the inexpressible depth of realizing himself as God, pointing out the insufficiency of language and concepts to convey this awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Beyond other teachings and teachers</strong> : Leo asserts that his awakening exceeded the teachings of all other spiritual teachers he has encountered, indicating a consciousness that most have not reached. Despite previous awakenings, this latest experience presented a deeper, undiscovered layer of infinite reality. </li>
<li><strong>Total awakenings and the infinity paradox</strong> : He explains the paradoxical nature of total awakenings. Each awakening feels complete, yet there is always more depth due to the infinite nature of existence. This contrasts the complacency of thinking one has fully grasped reality, which is a trap. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness creating the universe</strong> : During his awakening, Leo became fully aware of himself creating the entire universe, a realization that most are not conscious of. He discusses the ongoing rewiring of his mind and body to embody this consciousness for daily living, acknowledging more integration work is necessary. </li>
<li><strong>Disruption and integration</strong> : The awakening disrupted Leo's normal life, leading him into a period where conventional routines were upended. He emphasizes the need for significant integration work and possibly even deeper awakenings to align his entire life with this 'god awareness.' </li>
<li><strong>Understanding of healing and consciousness</strong> : Leo talks about becoming aware of the root causes of diseases. While convinced of the possibility of miraculous healing at such a profound level of consciousness, he admits not yet fully understanding how to actualize that healing. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of potential for miracles</strong> : He suggests that with further work, he could reach levels of consciousness capable of miracles, previously achieved by only a few individuals in history. Leo is cautious about sharing this because of the potential for creating false expectations related to awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening, abilities, and ego</strong> : Leo clarifies that awakening itself doesn't change reality, but realizing everything as one's creation. He separates this realization from the potential to develop abilities after awakening, cautioning that the ego's desire to manipulate reality can inhibit genuine miraculous abilities, which must come from a place of absolute love and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Contrasting future teachings with other teachers</strong> : Anticipating that his future teachings may contradict those of other teachers, Leo insists that his perspective is informed by accessing levels of awareness that many have not. He attributes his confidence in this understanding to his profound awakenings and cautions against interpreting it as arrogance. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as a necessary tool for deep awakening</strong> : Leo maintains that conventional methods like meditation or yoga do not suffice to reach the profound levels of consciousness he discusses. He champions psychedelics, especially 5-MeO-DMT, as pivotal for truly understanding the nature of reality and realizing oneself as God. </li>
<li><strong>Insufficiency of traditional practices</strong> : Despite valuing meditation, self-inquiry, and yoga, Leo asserts that these methods are limited in their capacity to deliver the awakenings he experiences and advocates for. He dismisses the traditional routes as incapable of providing deep understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Future focus on psychedelic teachings</strong> : Leo signals a shift towards teachings that heavily involve psychedelics due to their transformative power. He urges radical open-mindedness and genuine self-testing of these experiences rather than merely intellectualizing or being dismissive. </li>
<li><strong>Low tolerance for close-mindedness</strong> : Leo is becoming uncompromising towards attitudes he perceives as ignorant or closed-minded. He indicates that his future content will not entertain non-serious engagement or skepticism regarding his methods, especially psychedelics. </li>
<li><strong>Streamlining teachings to reveal divinity</strong> : Leo aims to refine his teachings to assist those serious about spiritual work in realizing their deity and creating their own reality. He positions the realization of one's divine nature as the solitary significant pursuit in life. </li>
<li><strong>Healing through spiritual awakening</strong> : Leo shares his vision of using awakenings to heal both himself and others. He views health issues as spiritual challenges that, when overcome, can prove the potential for miraculous healing and deepen compassion and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Personal health struggles informing the journey</strong> : Chronic fatigue, thyroid issues, and non-responsive health problems are seen by Leo as catalysts for deepening his spiritual awakening and ultimately will enhance his teachings on self-healing. </li>
<li><strong>Period of solitude and content production break</strong> : Announcing a hiatus from content creation, Leo seeks to concentrate on further awakening and cleansing to advance his abilities. Depending on his progress, the break may extend beyond the initially planned 30 days. </li>
<li><strong>Anticipating a transformation in teaching</strong> : As he ventures deeper into his spiritual journey, Leo foresees a transformation within himself and his content. He is committed to returning with a more mature and profound embodiment of his work, promising a renewed approach to his teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge of Balancing Sharing and Solitude</strong> : Leo describes the difficulty in balancing his desire to openly share teachings with the necessity of personal solitude to master self-understanding and enhance his consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Anticipated Transformation</strong> : Leo warns of significant changes to come in his own being, energy, and teaching style over the next months, which he acknowledges may not always be perceived positively by his audience. </li>
<li><strong>Increasing Seriousness in Teachings</strong> : As Leo focuses on more advanced topics, he anticipates that his teachings will become more serious and abstract, potentially leading to both misunderstanding and criticism. </li>
<li><strong>Confronting the Idea of Being God</strong> : Leo touches on the controversial notion that each individual is God, aware that it's a concept that may cause discomfort or resistance in people, yet is central to his teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Process of Spiritual Growth</strong> : Leo explains that realizing one's own divinity is a complex process that can turn life upside down, potentially leading to feelings of being lost, depression, and health issues. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Shedding Old Self</strong> : He likens spiritual awakening to a lobster shedding its shell, a vulnerable yet necessary phase for growth, illustrating the need for complete transformation to achieve greater spiritual heights. </li>
<li><strong>Core Teachings Explained</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the basic premise of his future teachings will revolve around there being no separation between the self and God, the nature of consciousness, and the universality of love. </li>
<li><strong>Obstacles to Self-Realization</strong> : Leo commits to helping others remove obstacles to realizing their own divinity, across various life spheres including sexuality, finances, health, and epistemology. </li>
<li><strong>Life&rsquo;s Problems Stemming from Self</strong> : He posits that most life problems are a result of one's identity, and true change requires an inner transformation, not just external changes to life's circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation and Letting Go of Fear</strong> : Leo speaks of the need for individuals to face and let go of deep-seated fears and resistance to self-change, allowing the emergence of a more expansive, selfless identity aligned with the true self as God. </li>
<li><strong>Approach to Solving Life Problems</strong> : He asserts the futility of seeking solutions that do not involve self-change and stresses that the deeper problems in one's life are indicative of the changes one must make within. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of Comprehensive Change</strong> : People are reluctant to change their lifestyle, worldview, relationships, and personal biases. They fear being wrong, opening up to new perspectives, or admitting past mistakes. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Superficial Changes</strong> : Superficial or peripheral changes without addressing core personal issues result in limited growth. Profound transformation requires tackling the fundamental aspects of one's identity. </li>
<li><strong>Suffering from Maintaining False Self</strong> : The discomfort with fundamental change results from a deep-seated, biased sense of self, causing depression, anxiety, and even physical sickness by distorting reality to preserve one's ego. </li>
<li><strong>Potential of Selfless Realization</strong> : Letting go of falsehoods and biases leads to infinite selflessness. By becoming infinitely selfless, one can realize themselves as the creator, not a victim, of life. </li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Truth Over Falsehood</strong> : Pursuing truth leads to the purification of biases, allowing one to reconfigure life to align with the unbiased truth, becoming a leader for truth and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Satisfaction Through Recognizing One's Divinity</strong> : Without realizing one's true nature as God, satisfaction remains elusive. Only by accepting one's infinite, unconditional love, and consciousness can one achieve ultimate fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation Journey as God's Realization Process</strong> : Life is viewed as a journey where God takes various paths or 'wormholes,' each leading back to self-realization, with the only genuine goal being to understand oneself as God. </li>
<li><strong>Willingness to Embrace Radical Change</strong> : Leo asks if individuals are ready to undergo drastic self-transformation that may be frightening but is essential to align their lives with truth and self-realization. </li>
<li><strong>Underestimation of Work and Reward in Spiritual Growth</strong> : People tend to underestimate the extent of inner work required for transformation and also what can be ultimately achieved – the entire universe and realization as God. </li>
<li><strong>Dedication to Overcoming Mental Obstacles</strong> : Leo commits to helping individuals navigate and surmount mental barriers that prevent them from realizing their divine nature, emphasizing that the search is for infinite love beyond finite means. </li>
<li><strong>Continuous Seeking and Use of Leo's Resources</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to revisit and deeply engage with his content for a richer understanding and assurance of more transformative content in the future, highlighting his available courses, forum, and book list. He also mentions a hiatus for personal growth, which will ultimately benefit the teachings he shares.</li>
