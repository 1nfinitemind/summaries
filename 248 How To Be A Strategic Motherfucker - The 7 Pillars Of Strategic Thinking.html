            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4oVrMpvtU8c' target='_blank'>How To Be A Strategic Motherfucker - The 7 Pillars Of Strategic Thinking</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Strategic Thinking Importance</strong> : Leo highlights strategic thinking as the difference between a successful life and one that is unsatisfactory. He cites a course by Stanley Ridley on strategic theory from military to sports as a rich source of insights that are applicable to personal self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>The History of Strategic Studies</strong> : The long history of strategic studies in military, business, and sports, where competition, concrete results, and high stakes are prevalent, provides valuable lessons that can be applied to personal life. </li>
<li><strong>Self as the Competitor in Self-Actualization</strong> : Leo proposes an internal competition between a person's lower self and higher self, emphasizing the need for strategizing against one's own self-deceptive tendencies and inner conflicts. </li>
<li><strong>Struggles from Lack of Strategy</strong> : He observes that most people&#39;s lives are filled with routine struggles, repeating the same issues due to a lack of strategic thinking and planning. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of Strategic Thinking</strong> : Strategic thinking is defined through various quotes as setting long-range goals based on careful assessment, deeply considering the future, crafting methods to achieve desired outcomes, studying competition, and responding to changing environments. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Self-Actualization Strategy</strong> : Leo urges the viewer to see strategizing for self-actualization as a primary focus of life, spending substantial time planning and adjusting personal habits to achieve this end. </li>
<li><strong>Common Strategic Blunders</strong> : Leo lists typical strategic errors like getting married too young, neglecting education or self-improvement, being seduced by immediate success, and failing to consider strategic factors in personal life choices. </li>
<li><strong>Failure in Micro and Macro Thinking</strong> : Many people lack the skill to switch between big-picture thinking and detail-oriented planning, resulting in either abstract daydreaming without action or getting lost in minutiae without a clear goal. </li>
<li><strong>Problem with Immediate Gratification</strong> : Leo emphasizes that failure in delay gratification leads to poor strategy formation, as marketing exploits this weakness, whereas true value in life is earned through delayed gratification and strategic effort. </li>
<li><strong>Unawareness of Life's Cul-de-Sacs</strong> : A lack of foresight into life's pitfalls, traps, and risks is a significant strategic failure, highlighting the importance of recognizing and planning for these issues. </li>
<li><strong>Intellect and Information Gathering Deficit</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of intelligence gathering in various life areas such as career, relationships, self-improvement, arguing that without comprehensive intel, one's strategy is significantly weakened. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of long-range decision-making</strong> : Leo points out that important long-term strategic decisions cannot be made without sufficient intelligence, implying that most people suffer from a lack of self-awareness, hindering their strategic capabilities. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of overcompensation</strong> : He observes that people neurotically overcompensate for their issues, leading to a slew of strategic problems, much like a reactive rather than proactive general on the battlefield. </li>
<li><strong>Chasing short-term gains</strong> : Leo criticizes the tendency to chase smaller, immediate rewards rather than evaluating and prioritizing outcomes for larger, more significant prizes. </li>
<li><strong>Obliviousness to social and business traps</strong> : He warns against being blind to the various traps laid by society and business, which are often designed to profit at the individual's expense and hamper personal growth and self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Neglecting strategy in personal life</strong> : Discussion about the lack of strategic thought given to personal life decisions, noting that most people invest zero time per week in strategizing, much like a general who doesn't plan his military campaigns. </li>
<li><strong>Failure to address root causes</strong> : Leo calls out the common mistake of not addressing problems at their root, resulting in recurring issues instead of permanent solutions. </li>
<li><strong>Neglecting resource development</strong> : He stresses the importance of investing time to develop strategic resources necessary for achieving life goals, comparing it to a general who prepares thoroughly for battle. </li>
<li><strong>Overview of the seven pillars of strategic thinking</strong> : Leo summarizes strategic thinking into seven pillars: strategic intent, analysis, preparation, concentration of force, execution, adaptability, and the study of principles. </li>
<li><strong>Defining strategic intent</strong> : Emphasizing the first pillar, strategic intent, Leo describes it as a clear vision of the desired outcome that dictates all actions and steps towards achieving it. </li>
<li><strong>Detailing strategic analysis</strong> : The second pillar, strategic analysis, involves assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and efficiently allocating resources like time and energy towards achieving strategic intent. </li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Competitor Responses</strong> : Leo discusses the need to anticipate and incorporate responses from competitors into one's strategy. In self-actualization, the 'competitor' is oneself, including the ego and lower self. He underscores the importance of being aware of how one's subconscious might resist or sabotage personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Strategic Preparation Revisited</strong> : Strategic preparation is likened to a general equipping his troops for battle. It entails building strategic reserves and laying groundwork, not just making tactical battlefield decisions. This includes thorough training, hard work, discipline, sound planning, and the development of unique capabilities. </li>
<li><strong>Concentration of Force Principle</strong> : Leo explains the military principle of concentrating force at a decisive point to achieve breakthroughs. He applies this to personal life, questioning how one concentrates time, energy, money, and attention, and whether they're directed toward the most impactful areas. </li>
<li><strong>Detailed Execution Importance</strong> : Leo emphasizes that both a great plan and great execution are required to succeed. He refers to his dedicated study on execution and unwiring bad habits to improve his efficacy in this area, encouraging others to do the same. </li>
<li><strong>Adaptability in Strategy</strong> : Strategy, according to Leo, involves flexibility and the willingness to adapt when external conditions change. He criticizes rigidity and promotes planning with contingencies, using the evolution of PayPal's business model as an example of successful adaptability. </li>
<li><strong>Study of Principles</strong> : The final pillar Leo discusses is the study of principles to shape one's thinking. He calls for deep immersion in the principles of life and self-actualization to allow for genius insights, encouraging a rigorous study of principles rather than a superficial understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Study of Self-Actualization</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to be excited about learning self-actualization principles, suggesting it should be a continuous, life-long process. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Perception as a "Strategic Motherfucker"</strong> : Leo invites viewers to adopt an attitude of being strategic in every action and maintaining a larger purpose for each life decision. </li>
<li><strong>Early Strategic Thinking</strong> : Leo shares that since childhood, he has always thought strategically about his life, from his career to his eventual retirement. </li>
