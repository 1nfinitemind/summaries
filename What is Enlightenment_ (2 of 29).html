        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/tFxl8zPLbeY?si=mUqQJKVf0cpjhb85' target='_blank'>What is Enlightenment? (2 of 29)</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment transcends states, experiences, emotions, and insights, as these are mind functions. Enlightenment is about becoming conscious of the absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception of Perception as Truth</strong> : Our current perceptions are not absolute; they are shaped by the needs of our organism to survive. What seems like everything we perceive is, in fact, a limited view tailored for survival, not the complete truth. </li>
<li><strong>Human Growth within Ignorance</strong> : From non-existence to self-invention, the process of learning as humans traps our consciousness in fabricating identities and learning about the world, without gaining direct consciousness of true existence. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as Direct Consciousness</strong> : Enlightenment opens up the possibility to directly know consciousness, self, and existence which transcends learned, relative experience - it's a direct understanding of the absolute. </li>
<li><strong>Simplicity and Accessibility of Enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment is neither grand nor mundane and does not relate to scales or charts, but simply means becoming directly conscious of what is true. </li>
<li><strong>Ease of Achieving Enlightenment</strong> : While striving for enlightenment can be challenging, the act of enlightenment is natural, being fully present, and conscious - it is effortless and lies in simply being where one already is.</li>
</ul>
