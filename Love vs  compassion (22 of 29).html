            <ul>
    <li><b>Relative nature of love</b>: Leo conveys that love is often felt as a relative emotion and not the absolute truth of the experience.
</li><li><b>Love as an enticement</b>: Leo notes that love, peace, and harmony may serve as enticements for people to join communities or follow teachings, which he chooses to avoid to prevent misconceptions.
</li><li><b>Conscious avoidance of planting expectations</b>: Leo deliberately refrains from framing enlightenment with terms like 'love' to avoid setting specific expectations within the minds of those working towards enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Love as a byproduct of enlightenment</b>: The love resulting from enlightenment, according to Leo, is not emotional or personal but is rather a kind of universal connection with others.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment expressed as service</b>: Leo sees the postâ€“enlightenment expression of love mainly as a commitment to assist others in their journey to understanding, which aligns with his notion of compassion over the traditional idea of love.
</li><li><b>Love not being negative</b>: Despite not focusing on love in his teachings, Leo clarifies that love is not negative; it simply isn't the centerpiece of his work on enlightenment.
</li>
