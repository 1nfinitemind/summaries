        <ul>
<li><strong>Relative nature of love</strong> : Ralston conveys that love is often felt as a relative emotion and not the absolute truth of the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Love as an enticement</strong> : Ralston notes that love, peace, and harmony may serve as enticements for people to join communities or follow teachings, which he chooses to avoid to prevent misconceptions. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious avoidance of planting expectations</strong> : Ralston deliberately refrains from framing enlightenment with terms like 'love' to avoid setting specific expectations within the minds of those working towards enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Love as a byproduct of enlightenment</strong> : The love resulting from enlightenment, according to Ralston, is not emotional or personal but is rather a kind of universal connection with others. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment expressed as service</strong> : Ralston sees the post-enlightenment expression of love mainly as a commitment to assist others in their journey to understanding, which aligns with his notion of compassion over the traditional idea of love. </li>
<li><strong>Love not being negative</strong> : Despite not focusing on love in his teachings, Ralston clarifies that love is not negative; it simply isn't the centerpiece of his work on enlightenment.</li>
