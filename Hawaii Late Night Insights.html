            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/hawaii-april-2018-late-night-insights' target='_blank'>Hawaii Late Night Insights</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Striving for permanence in awakening</b>: Leo is attempting to make his deep awakening experiences permanent during his solo retreat by focusing highly on the notion of nothingness during meditation.
</li><li><b>The inverse of self and ego</b>: He has come to understand that what he truly seeks–the nature of his existence–is the inverse of self and ego, essentially nothingness and infinity, suggesting a need for ego surrender for deeper insight.
</li><li><b>Experience of existential envelopment</b>: During intense meditation, Leo feels engulfed by nothingness, leading to a profound suffering analogous to physical symptoms of death, reinforcing his insight that genuine understanding requires self–surrender.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of physical death</b>: Leo advocates that true awakening demands not just psychological or ego death, but the acceptance of one's own physical death, encompassing the surrender of life's enjoyments and identity.
</li><li><b>Criticizing the understatement of awakening's difficulty</b>: He critiques many spiritual teachings for understating the rigors of awakening, clarifying that proper meditation leads to confronting a critical choice between succumbing to fears or surrendering to truth.
</li><li><b>Buddha's revered image and death</b>: Leo reflects on Buddha's revered status and how his moment of awakening, depicted in statues worldwide, signifies the death of the small self and the continuation of the body as a mere vessel for teaching post–awakening.
</li><li><b>Materialist paradigm's limitation</b>: The materialist, egoic, and dualistic paradigms struggle to comprehend the continuation of life without the self. This notion challenges the very core of understanding reality, as it does not align with the experience of the self being alive.
</li><li><b>The Buddha's awakening</b>: Described as a form of actual physical death, the Buddha's awakening is presented as an embodiment of surrender and the ultimate leap of faith. This surrender is revered and symbolized in statues around the world, representing the ultimate cost paid for enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Fear of actual death during awakening</b>: Leo confronts his fear that the awakening process might lead to his actual physical death. He recognizes this as a possible outcome and prepares to accept it, which represents a significant mental and emotional milestone in his journey towards enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Understanding the sacrifice for awakening</b>: Most people are unprepared for the level of sacrifice required for true awakening, which is described as the willingness to sacrifice physical life for truth. The process involves intense suffering and a paradox where the pursuit of eternal happiness ultimately requires one to face their physical mortality first.
</li><li><b>Clarification on real death</b>: Leo emphasizes that awakening does not involve literal physical harm but is about accepting real death in the sense of realizing one's non–existence from the beginning. 
</li><li><b>Illusory nature of self</b>: Despite the fear and sensation of a pounding heart during meditation, he recognized that the self he thought he was surrendering is an illusion, as he was essentially 'nothing' all along.
</li><li><b>The challenge of conscious surrender</b>: The difficulty lies in consciously deciding to let go and surrender to the process, which is complicated by the fear of death. Leo faced significant resistance from his ego, which caused inner suffering.
</li><li><b>Love as a means to conquer fear</b>: In the struggle to surrender, Leo discovered that invoking the feeling of infinite love can dissolve the fear, and the intention to act out of love for truth, humanity, and reality became his intended method to transcend fear.
</li><li><b>Meditation session conclusion</b>: Despite the build–up to a potential awakening and overcoming fear with love, the expected transformation did not occur. Leo's intensive meditation session ended without the anticipated breakthrough.
</li><li><b>Validity of process insights</b>: Leo explains that his insights are credible, even in the absence of a full awakening during the session, due to his cumulative experiences from smaller awakenings and deepened understanding over time.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a preview to awakening</b>: He argues that psychedelics are powerful tools for understanding the dying process related to ego death and can offer profound, real experiences that demonstrate the process without one's conscious effort to die.
</li><li><b>Comparison between suicide and ego death</b>: Ego death during meditation is compared to the arduous task of overcoming one's survival instincts–as difficult or even harder than the physical act of suicide due to the ego's deep–rooted resistance.
</li><li><b>Repeated attempts and psychedelic support</b>: Real awakening requires persistent effort and might involve many attempts. Psychedelic experiences, particularly 5–MeO–DMT, help diminish the fear of ego death by repeatedly crossing the threshold, making the process less intimidating over time.
</li><li><b>Awakening as permanent death</b>: The pursuit of awakening that the most revered sages have achieved equates to a permanent death of the ego, a key distinction from ordinary self–improvement or consciousness work, which Leo highlights with great emphasis.
</li><li><b>Insight on the awakening process</b>: Leo identifies his past lack of understanding about facing his own death; he now comprehends that awakening requires an acceptance akin to physically dying and takes a leap of faith inspired by infinite love.
</li><li><b>The illusion of the little self</b>: The transition from the ego, or little self, to the big self–the true infinite self–is seen as a form of death by the ego, which ultimately is an illusion. Crossing this barrier reveals that the fear and life associated with the ego were never real.
</li><li><b>The persistent nature of the ego</b>: Leo likens the ego to a relentless antagonist in a horror film or video game that requires continuous confrontations and defeats to fully extinguish, highlighting the non–linear and repetitive path to true awakening for many individuals.
</li><li><b>Awakening as a multichapter journey</b>: Contrary to many spiritual teachings that oversimplify the process, Leo emphasizes that the journey to awakening may span multiple 'chapters,' with each one requiring renewed effort and different approaches.
</li><li><b>The gravity and exclusivity of awakening</b>: The process is not for everyone; it is a serious, profound undertaking reserved for those wholly dedicated to discovering truth and undergoing a transformation akin to that experienced by historical spiritual figures like Buddha.
</li><li><b>Channeling infinite love for transcendence</b>: The key to overcoming the fear experienced at the brink of awakening is channeling infinite love, an emotion so potent that it can overwhelm and extinguish the ego. Leo suggests that psychedelics can facilitate the initial experience of this love, which can then be recalled at the crucial moment of surrender.
</li><li><b>The hero's paradoxical journey</b>: The journey to awakening is akin to the hero's journey, where the hero's perceived self–sacrifice is paradoxical because the 'hero' never truly existed–it was always an illusion. The recognition and experience of the infinite self is considered the pinnacle of non–duality and the most significant achievement.
