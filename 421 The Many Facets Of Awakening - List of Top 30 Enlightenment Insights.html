            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/OgtPGEBGUWw' target='_blank'>The Many Facets Of Awakening - List of Top 30 Enlightenment Insights</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misconception of Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment often misunderstood as one single realization, when in fact, it is a complex series of realize able facets, aspects, and degrees.
</li><li><b>Value of the Top 30 Enlightenment Insights List</b>: Provides a methodical approach and checklist for spiritual practitioners to gauge their progress and avoid the pitfall of believing they are fully enlightened after experiencing just a few facets.
</li><li><b>Samadhi and Mystical Experiences</b>: The first facet involves the realization of the Samadhi state or non–dual consciousness where the perceived separation between the observer and the observed dissolves.
</li><li><b>Realization of No Self</b>: Understading that the individual self is just an imaginary construct, leading to the awakening that the 'self' a person commonly identifies with, doesn't truly exist.
</li><li><b>The Universal "I Am" Insight</b>: A vital realization where one shifts from identifying as a mere human being to recognizing oneself as the universal essence of existence, pure 'I am–ness,' or Atman.
</li><li><b>Omnipresence of Consciousness</b>: The epiphany that one's true self, pure consciousness, is not localized but rather omnipresent, present everywhere and nowhere, simultaneously.
</li><li><b>Understanding What Consciousness Is</b>: A major shift in perspective is required to understand consciousness as the all–encompassing essence, with nothing existing outside of it.
</li><li><b>The Literal Meaning of Awakening</b>: Awakening is not a metaphorical concept but a literal experience akin to waking up from a dream, becoming truly aware for the first time.
</li><li><b>Realization of Non–Duality and Oneness</b>: The insight that all separations are illusions and that everything is intrinsically unified in a single field of consciousness.
</li><li><b>List as a Systematic Pursuit</b>: The insights serve as a structured progression for seekers to follow, providing a clear understanding of various spiritual milestones.
</li><li><b>Metaphor of Climbing Mountains</b>: The awakening process is compared to climbing a range of mountains rather than a single mountain, with multiple paths leading to various peaks, symbolizing the diversity of spiritual realizations.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Sharing the List</b>: Leo, Leo, intends to prevent self–deception among practitioners and to highlight areas of awakening that may be overlooked, thus ensuring a more complete journey towards enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Realization of Oneness</b>: Awakening to the fact that reality is a singular, unified entity with no separations between objects or beings, highlighting the interconnectedness of everything within a unified field of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Practical Implications of Oneness</b>: The understanding that perceived separateness is a mental projection and that non–duality means no true separation exists, enabling one to comprehend true non–duality by contrasting it against the notion of duality.
</li><li><b>On the Nature of Differences</b>: Leo illuminates that perceived differences between objects or entities like a cat and a dog, or a taco and a human, are purely imaginary and only exist if believed or imagined by the mind.
</li><li><b>Understanding Absolute Truth</b>: One realizes truth is not just a perception or experience, nor a belief or conceptual idea, but an absolute reality identical to consciousness itself, recontextualizing all perceptions and experiences as absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Realization of the Absolute</b>: Leo explains that only through awakening can one grasp what the absolute truly means, as it exists independently of all conditions, even the annihilation of the universe.
</li><li><b>Insight Into Absolute Infinity</b>: Understanding that consciousness is infinite, not in numerical or spatial terms but as an absolute concept, allows one to realize the manifestation of everything as a form of absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Concept of Absolute Nothingness</b>: Recognizing that all of existence, including consciousness and the self, is fundamentally made of absolute nothing, leading to the profound revelation that nothing has truly happened since nothingness and infinity are identical.
</li><li><b>Realization of God and the Godhead</b>: Directly encountering and realizing God and its true essence, which goes beyond common misconceptions about the concept. Understanding that "God" refers to an actual reality rather than an imaginary concept.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as God</b>: One realizes that they are God, the creator of all reality, and that self–denial of this fact is a barrier to full awakening. One must accept their own divine authority and the properties traditionally ascribed to God.
</li><li><b>Self Equals Other</b>: The realization that all perceived others are actually partitions of one's own consciousness, leading to an understanding that any interaction with others is in fact an interaction with oneself.
</li><li><b>Realization of Absolute Love</b>: Discovering that consciousness is made of love, which is not an emotion but a substance, and recognizing that all manifestations, even those labeled as evil, are expressions of this absolute love.
</li><li><b>Truth and Love as Identical</b>: A sub–facet of the realization that absolute love encompasses that truth and love are identical, reinforcing the profound connection between the foundational substance of consciousness and the ultimate reality.
</li><li><b>Infinite Mind and the Imaginary Nature of Reality</b>: Recognizing that everything experienced–objects, beings, and phenomena–are manifestations of an infinite mind, leading to the insight that reality is fundamentally imaginary.
</li><li><b>Everything as Imagination</b>: The recognition that all physical reality, personal history, and the very concept of differences–like those between animals or objects–are entirely imaginary creations of the cosmic mind, which is synonymous with one's own mind.
</li><li><b>Facet of Self–Design</b>: A profound realization that the individual creates not only the universe but also themselves, down to meticulous details such as each hair on their body, as an act of creation by an infinitely intelligent mind.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Birth as Imaginary</b>: The insight that one's existence did not commence with physical birth; rather, one has always existed. The traditional narrative of birth is understood as a mere imaginary story without genuine occurrence.
</li><li><b>Realization of Eternity and the Absolute Now</b>: Awakening to the notion that past and future are illusions and that everything, including oneself, exists eternally and absolutely in the present moment.
</li><li><b>Death as an Illusion and Immortality</b>: Coming to the insight that the concept of death is a fabricated story by the ego, and in reality, one is immortal and exists eternally as all forms and beings outside of time.
</li><li><b>Realization of Paradise or Heaven</b>: The understanding that heaven is not a location but a state of consciousness where one recognizes their immortality and is free from fear, effectively living in a perpetual state of perfection.
</li><li><b>Experiential Realization of Bliss and Ecstasy</b>: Experiencing a state of ultimate bliss or ecstasy, which comes from the understanding of immortality and the nature of reality as infinitely good and perfect.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence</b>: The understanding that the intelligence of consciousness surpasses all physical manifestations and that everything in the universe functions as part of a supremely intelligent and well–oiled machine.
</li><li><b>Understanding Absolute Goodness</b>: Realizing that everything in the universe, without exception, is inherently good, and what is perceived as bad or evil is merely a projection of personal selfishness.
</li><li><b>Infinite Will</b>: Recognizing that all of existence is a manifestation of God's will, which, being infinite, materializes instantly as the fabric of reality, including one's own being and actions.
</li><li><b>Understanding God's Will and Human Will</b>: The concept that human free will is a fragment of God's infinite will, and that what is perceived as the individual's will is actually part of a greater, universal will.
</li><li><b>Infinite Will and Unlimited Power</b>: The acknowledgement that God, or infinite mind, is boundless, and can create anything without limitations. This realization includes the understanding that perceived physical or logical restrictions are not truly constraints on God's power.
</li><li><b>Omniscience at the Level of Being</b>: Omniscience is clarified not as knowing all factual information, but as a complete awareness at the level of being. A person can be absolutely omniscient in their being, yet not know trivial details like their neighbor's lunch.
</li><li><b>Realization of Divinity, Magic, and Mystery</b>: Enlightenment brings about the realization that consciousness is divine, turning ordinary human perception into an experience of the profound, magical, and mysterious nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Exploring the Substance of Reality</b>: The quest to understand being and consciousness as the fundamental substance of reality. This pursuit leads to the recognition that consciousness is intrinsically nothing and that differences are illusory.
</li><li><b>Recognition of the Universe as an Infinite Fractal</b>: The discovery that the universe is a fractal, exhibiting self–similarity at all scales, which one can zoom into or out of infinitely.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization of Perception and Life</b>: The insight that perception is not merely a human function but an expression of truth or being, alongside the realization that the entire universe is alive in various forms, which transcends traditional scientific queries about the origin of life.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Existence as Love</b>: The ultimate understanding that the purpose of everything that exists–including complexity, form, and events–is an expression of love, which is the manifestation of oneself as God.
</li><li><b>Channeling and Communication with God</b>: The facet of being able to communicate with one's higher infinite self or God, gaining direct insights and answers from this source of ultimate consciousness.
</li><li><b>Healing Through Connection with God's Will</b>: The realization that healing oneself and others is possible by tapping into the infinite mind and aligning with the will of God, which underlies all existence.
</li><li><b>Collective Consciousness and Conscious Layers</b>: Recognition of consciousness as layered like an onion, with personal consciousness being just one layer within a broader collective consciousness that one can access.
</li><li><b>Total Extinction of Perception</b>: A facet that has been reported by advanced meditators and Buddhists, wherein through deep meditation, one may experience the disappearance of the entire universe, something Leo has not personally experienced but believes to be possible.
</li><li><b>Paranormal Phenomena and Interactions</b>: The experience of various paranormal abilities and phenomena, such as clairvoyance, telepathy, past–life regressions, hyper intuition, and the interaction with non–human entities like aliens, which are perceived as projections of one's own mind yet hold relative reality.
</li><li><b>The Nature of Spiritual Realizations</b>: These realizations can occur individually or in clusters, sequentially or simultaneously, with varying depths of insight. They create a complex matrix of spiritual understanding, which reveals the intricate nature of enlightenment and the diverse paths one can take in their spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Complexity of Spiritual Work</b>: A recognition of the multifaceted and layered nature of spiritual insights, reflecting the vast array of awakenings and depths of understanding that can be attained, illustrating the inherent complexity and breadth of spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Variety of Spiritual Facets</b>: Leo describes spiritual awakening as a complex process with numerous facets, each capable of being a profound realization that can challenge and reshape one's understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Assembling Insight Like a Puzzle</b>: The process of awakening involves intermittent realizations, sometimes separated by long periods. Individuals must stitch together these insights over time, likened to assembling a jigsaw puzzle where each piece contributes to the perception of the whole picture.
</li><li><b>Integration of Spiritual Insights</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of integrating various insights and matching them up in order to form a coherent understanding of the larger truth, similar to recognizing different parts that compose the entire image of an animal in a jigsaw puzzle.
</li><li><b>The Shocking Nature of Awakening</b>: Realizations such as identifying oneself as God can be destabilizing, leading to self–doubt or feelings of insanity due to the profound nature of the insight and the contradiction it presents to societal norms.
</li><li><b>Risk of Distortion and Misinterpretation</b>: There is a danger in misinterpreting insights, potentially leading to a distorted view of reality that reflects one's own ego and shadow rather than objective truth.
</li><li><b>Navigating Self–Doubt and External Influence</b>: Leo acknowledges the challenges of overcoming self–doubt and societal pressure, highlighting the value of his list as a confirmation for those who may feel alone in their realizations.
</li><li><b>Diversity Among Spiritual Teachers and Traditions</b>: He explains that different spiritual traditions and teachers may prioritize certain aspects of awakening over others, which can result in a skewed focus and incomplete understanding of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Teacher Limitations</b>: Leo warns of the limitations inherent in spiritual teachings, as teachers may not recognize or integrate all facets of awakening, potentially due to their adherence to narrow or dogmatic paths.
</li><li><b>Potential Lopsidedness in Awakening</b>: The journey to spiritual awakening can be partial, with individuals excelling in certain aspects while lacking in others. This can lead to imbalanced teachings and experiences.
</li><li><b>Critical Evaluation of Teachings</b>: He urges not to assume full enlightenment from any one guru or teaching, as they might not address all facets or may dismiss aspects unknown to them as irrelevant.
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics are presented as tools that can help illuminate various facets of awakening from different angles, due to their capacity to alter states of consciousness and highlight different aspects.
</li><li><b>Influence of Intentions on the Awakening Process</b>: Leo points out how one's genuine curiosity and intentions can guide which facet of awakening is experienced next, highlighting the significance of quality questioning and self–inquiry in this journey.
</li><li><b>Existential Questions and Spiritual Facets</b>: Minor existential questions, such as whether to get married or have children, can be explored alongside major spiritual facets. The pursuit of understanding these facets can lead to insights that inform personal decisions.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a Tool for Awakening</b>: Leo sees psychedelics as an efficient way to access and understand various facets of awakening. They allow targeting of specific facets and deliver a panoramic big–picture view of consciousness, God, and reality.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics vs. Traditional Approaches</b>: While psychedelics offer a broad range of spiritual experiences, traditional methods like yoga or meditation can also lead to awakening but may have limitations based on the techniques used.
</li><li><b>Methodology and Understanding Consciousness</b>: The ultimate goal should be understanding consciousness itself; the specific methodology, whether psychedelics, yoga or meditation, should be secondary to this pursuit.
</li><li><b>Teachers' Perspectives on Spiritual Facets</b>: Different spiritual teachers can offer varying perspectives on awakening, leading to apparent contradictions. This could be due to a difference in terminology, depth of understanding, or the range of facets realized.
</li><li><b>Taking Responsibility and Questioning Gurus</b>: Followers should take responsibility for their spiritual journeys and not assume all teachers are equally enlightened or have comprehended every potential facet of awakening.
</li><li><b>Disparate Teachings and Spiritual Realization</b>: The diversity of spiritual teachings reflects that not all paths or techniques are equally effective for realizing all facets of awakening. It's wise to compare teachings to understand the range and depth of different spiritual insights.
</li><li><b>Danger of Partial Realizations</b>: A partial awakening might miss crucial aspects like unconditional love or the notion of God, potentially leading to distortions in understanding and teaching.
</li><li><b>One Truth, Many Facets</b>: The oneness of truth and the manyness of reality are not contradictory; they are different perspectives that ultimately unite into a singular absolute oneness, akin to the many facets of a jewel representing one entity.
</li><li><b>Total Number of Facets</b>: It's uncertain how many facets there are, as this number can vary based on differentiation criteria. However, at least two dozen major facets are deemed critical for a comprehensive awakening.
</li><li><b>Beyond Spiritual Realizations</b>: Realizing spiritual facets is only part of the journey; other areas such as emotional mastery, shadow work, personal development, and relationship skills still require attention and work.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about enlightenment</b>: Knowing the facets of awakening does not equate to overcoming all personal issues, such as bad habits, addictions, or limiting and fallacious beliefs.
</li><li><b>Incomplete spiritual development</b>: Understanding various facets of spirituality doesn't automatically result in cognitive, moral, interpersonal, or political maturity, nor does it guarantee career or technical skill development.
</li><li><b>Challenges of embodying insights</b>: Realizing profound spiritual insights, like recognizing oneself as God or seeing beyond the concept of evil, doesn't ensure their permanent embodiment in daily life.
</li><li><b>Personal struggles with enlightenment concepts</b>: Leo admits to his own difficulties in fully embodying insights such as the illusory nature of death and consistently manifesting love, especially when faced with challenging interactions.
</li><li><b>Endless minor insights</b>: Beyond major spiritual realizations, there are countless 'minor' insights regarding topics like science, evolution, art, relationships, and leadership which are valuable for advancing and evolving society.
</li><li><b>Value of questioning reality</b>: Pursuing understanding of both major and minor questions about reality is important and should not be dismissed as trivial.
</li><li><b>Nonstop depth of awakening</b>: Being cautious not to prematurely stop one's pursuit of awakening, as it is often deeper and richer than imagined, is essential.
</li><li><b>Deep understanding of reality</b>: The true measure of spiritual work is the depth of one's consciousness and understanding of reality, which influences how well insights are embodied.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for personal validation</b>: Validation of spiritual teachings should come through personal experience, urging viewers to test insights for themselves and not take Leo's word as absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Future uncertainty</b>: Leo reflects on possible future directions of his work, including deepening existential work, becoming a monk, or leaving behind his current role, emphasizing the evolving nature of his spiritual journey and teachings.
