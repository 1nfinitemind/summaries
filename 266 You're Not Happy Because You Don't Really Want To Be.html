            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5a9q6yPiwP0' target='_blank'>You're Not Happy Because You Don't Really Want To Be</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Acknowledgment of Unhappiness</b>: Leo opens the discussion by questioning the viewer's acknowledgment of their own unhappiness, pointing out that some might even be hiding that fact from themselves.
</li><li><b>Denial of Desire for Happiness</b>: Leo presents the possibility that people might not actually want to be happy, suggesting that this denial seems twisted but is worth exploring.
</li><li><b>Conditional vs. Unconditional Happiness</b>: Leo distinguishes between conditional happiness, which depends on everything going one's way, and unconditional happiness, which is maintained regardless of circumstances.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Conditional Happiness</b>: He explains that conditional happiness is unreliable because it requires a multitude of factors to align perfectly in an inherently chaotic universe.
</li><li><b>Uncomfortable Truth About Unconditional Happiness</b>: Leo challenges the listener to truly consider if they want unconditional happiness, which would mean being happy even in the worst of situations, like personal or family tragedy.
</li><li><b>Rules and Conditions of Happiness</b>: He discusses how most people set up rules for when they will allow themselves to be happy, like achieving certain goals, but argues that the true pursuit is happiness itself, not the means to it.
</li><li><b>Re–evaluating Motivation</b>: Leo suggests that if one can be happy without their usual motivators (work, success, etc.), it forces them to question why they pursue those things and what truly motivates them.
</li><li><b>Inverting the Success–Happiness Relationship</b>: He points out that many people work towards success in the belief it will bring happiness, but this approach often leads to success without fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Problematic Motivation Structures</b>: Leo criticizes the carrot–and–stick model of motivation, which ties happiness to rewards and punishment, resulting in a system that inherently includes periods of unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Conditional Structures</b>: He argues that a motivational structure based on conditional happiness inevitably leads to dissatisfaction and the feeling of a life that "sucks."
</li><li><b>Reworking Motivational Foundations</b>: Leo proposes that genuinely seeking happiness will require a fundamental change in how one understands their motivations and views life, even if it involves redefining personal happiness outside of societal norms.
</li><li><b>Assimilation of Identity and Motivation</b>: Leo argues that individuals often assimilate actions into their identity to simplify motivation, leading to an alignment of their sense of self with roles like being a business person, family person, or health–conscious individual. This creates an issue when these roles don't actually lead to happiness but are prioritized due to their incorporation into one's identity.
</li><li><b>Struggle with Identity and Happiness</b>: The conundrum lies in the resistance to relinquish parts of one's identity that are not fulfilling, for fear of losing oneself or facing significant life changes, which underscores the deep–seated prioritization of identity over authentic happiness.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Happiness Through Lists and Rules</b>: Leo criticizes the idea that happiness can be achieved by ticking off items from a list of conditions, such as income or relationship status. These rules, cemented since childhood and influenced by various factors like family and society, create a barrier to real happiness.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Foundation of Happiness</b>: To achieve genuine happiness, Leo advocates for a fundamental questioning and letting go of the rules that dictate our happiness, realizing that the holes or deficiencies we feel are illusions and that we are inherently complete without external validations.
</li><li><b>Unconditional Happiness Requires Self–Actualization</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of self–actualization and internal work to accept unconditional happiness, encouraging viewers to understand that they can be happy regardless of life's ups and downs, successes, and failures.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Life Beyond Pleasure and Pain</b>: The pursuit of unconditional happiness involves appreciating life's experiences for what they are, beyond the dualistic approach of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain; even negative experiences have intrinsic value.
</li><li><b>Purifying and Detachment Through Spiritual Work</b>: Attaining true happiness may involve spiritual work to purify oneself of all needs, including the most basic ones like food and water, freeing oneself from attachments and fears, such as the fear of death.
</li><li><b>Overcoming the Fear of Death</b>: Leo posits that genuinely overcoming the fear of death, not merely denying it, is key to detaching from basic survival needs like oxygen, and thus crucial for realizing unconditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Detachment vs. Abstinence</b>: Leo clarifies that detachment from needs such as oxygen means not being emotionally reliant on them, not necessarily giving up these elements altogether.
</li><li><b>Self–Actualization and Consciousness</b>: Leo asserts that an individual who is highly self–actualized and conscious would not be distressed by extreme isolation, illustrating this with the metaphor of living contentedly in a box–suggesting that the ability to enjoy mere consciousness is a sign of advanced psychological development.
</li><li><b>Valuing Detachment</b>: He advocates for the power of detachment, which allows one to experience life more richly without the suffering caused by attachment to transient pleasures, using the example of eating ice cream and the associated anticipatory loss.
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Embracing Unconditional Happiness</b>: Leo discusses the mental overhaul required to embrace unconditional happiness, which involves dismantling one's deeply ingrained rules and assumptions about what is necessary for happiness.
</li><li><b>Redefining Motivation</b>: Leo encourages the audience to accept a temporary loss of direction as they let go of neurotic motivations and assures that healthier, more profound motivations will emerge as a result.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Self–actualization Journey</b>: Finally, Leo invites viewers to follow his ongoing discourse on self–actualization and human psychology, suggesting that self–knowledge and perspective changes, rather than external achievements, hold the key to transforming one's life.
