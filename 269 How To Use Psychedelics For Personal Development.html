            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/CuOIECQ5zag' target='_blank'>How To Use Psychedelics For Personal Development</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Psychedelics</strong> : Leo clarifies that when he talks about psychedelics, he does not include substances like weed, crack, meth, coke, MDMA, ecstasy, or Molly. Instead, he focuses on substances like psilocybin (magic mushrooms), LSD, DMT, mescaline, ayahuasca, iboga, and the 2C-X class of chemicals. </li>
<li><strong>Methods of Psychedelic Use</strong> : There are four ways people typically use psychedelics: for fun or escape, for naive spirituality, for therapy or addiction recovery, and for personal development and awareness expansion. Leo emphasizes the last method, which aligns with his goals for education on safe and meaningful psychedelic use. </li>
<li><strong>Dangers of Naive Spirituality</strong> : Leo warns against the use of psychedelics to reinforce existing spiritual beliefs or dogmas, as this can lead to delusions and self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Uses for Therapy</strong> : Highlighting the research on psychedelics for therapy and addiction recovery, he acknowledges its effectiveness but explains that it isn't the focus of his discussion, which is personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Development and Non-Duality Work</strong> : Psychedelics can serve as aids for expanding consciousness and working towards enlightenment, providing insights into personal issues, relationships, business, and other areas of life. </li>
<li><strong>Methodical Approach to Usage</strong> : Leo advises starting with small doses and gradually increasing to a breakthrough dose. This methodical approach contrasts with using substances casually or recreationally without understanding their potential. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Education and Research</strong> : He emphasizes the need for extensive research and education before using psychedelics, understanding their effects, side effects, and proper dosing. </li>
<li><strong>Setting Serious Intentions</strong> : Before each trip, setting an intention, such as seeking truth or solving a problem, can guide the experience towards meaningful personal growth, with insights that last beyond the temporary psychedelic state. </li>
<li><strong>Studying Psychological Principles</strong> : To prevent bad trips and understand the mind, one should study human psychology, including topics like happiness, depression, addiction, ego, self-deception, and the nature of thoughts. </li>
<li><strong>Studying Non-Duality</strong> : Understanding non-duality or enlightenment can prevent getting lost in powerful visions and help focus on the workings of awareness and consciousness during a trip. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Meditation and Self-Inquiry</strong> : Establishing a meditation and self-inquiry routine grounds the individual during psychedelic experiences, motivating deeper practice and enhancing the transformative potential of psychedelics. </li>
<li><strong>Quiet and Safe Setting for Optimal Growth</strong> : A conducive environment is necessary for meaningful psychedelic experiences; noisy, social settings should be avoided to allow deep introspection and exploration of the subconscious, ego, and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Potential for Emotional Overwhelm and Delusion</strong> : Psychedelic experiences can evoke intense emotions and visions, but it's crucial to view these as reflections of one's subconscious rather than becoming deluded by them. </li>
<li><strong>Integration Time Post-Trip</strong> : Allocating time for integration following a trip is essential for processing the experience's impact on life areas like career and family, and to ensure permanent psychological change. </li>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing for Psychedelic Experiences</strong> : For those on a typical work schedule, tripping on Saturdays offers ample time for the experience and subsequent integration without work-related interruptions. </li>
<li><strong>Safety Preparations for Psychedelic Use</strong> : Conduct thorough research on substances, including dosages and potential adverse effects, and secure substances from reputable sources. Emphasize purity to reduce health risks and negative psychological impacts. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Pills and Research Chemicals</strong> : Stay away from untested chemicals and potentially dangerous substances like N-bombs, and use testing kits to verify purity and identity of substances before use. </li>
<li><strong>Starting with Small Dosages</strong> : To minimize risks of bad trips, start with small dosages and use a high precision scale for accurate measurement. </li>
<li><strong>Creating a Safe and Controlled Environment at Home</strong> : Initial use should be in a safe, familiar home setting, potentially with a trip sitter, and accompanied by preparation steps like a clean space, hidden dangerous items, and pre-stocked food and drinks. </li>
<li><strong>Medication and Mindset Prior to Consumption</strong> : Meditate to enter a calm state, set a clear intention for the experience, and consume the substance on a mildly empty stomach to reduce nausea. </li>
<li><strong>Eating Before Psychedelic Experience</strong> : It's recommended to eat something light, like fruit, to prevent hunger while keeping the stomach relatively empty to prevent discomfort during the trip. </li>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing for Psychedelic Use</strong> : Taking psychedelics around noon is ideal, as it allows for the full duration of the trip, without interfering with the normal sleep schedule and avoids feeling tired or hungover the next day. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Trip Stimulation Avoidance</strong> : In the week leading up to a psychedelic trip, abstaining from TV, movies, and web surfing is advised to prevent the mind from being preoccupied with potentially negative themes that could surface during the trip. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as a Personal Growth Tool</strong> : Psychedelics should be integrated into a personal development plan that includes detaching from harmful food, entertainment, and information, improving overall quality of life. </li>
<li><strong>Positive Mindset is Key</strong> : Ensure you're in a good mood and don't have looming stressful events or tasks before using psychedelics, as this can greatly influence the quality of the psychedelic experience. </li>
<li><strong>Tripping Without Distractions</strong> : Avoid having friends over, playing TV, or music during a trip to experience the substance in its pure form, especially for the first time, to fully understand its effects without distractions. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Mixing Substances</strong> : Mixing psychedelics with alcohol, weed, or other drugs can lead to a bad trip and is not recommended, especially if the aim is personal development rather than seeking an escape or recreation. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic Tolerance and Frequency of Use</strong> : To avoid cross tolerance, wait at least two weeks between each psychedelic experience and avoid using them more than once a week to prevent psychological addiction and to maintain their potency. </li>
<li><strong>Ensuring a Good Psychedelic Trip</strong> : Surrender fully to the experience, be assured of safety if guidelines are followed, and remind yourself that the experience is temporary and not real, providing comfort during intense moments. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics are not a Shortcut to Enlightenment</strong> : Recognize that psychedelics are not a path to enlightenment and avoid mistakenly interpreting powerful experiences as reaching an enlightened state, which requires deep self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Staying Grounded to Prevent Delusion</strong> : Be cautious not to let psychedelic experiences validate pre-existing beliefs or delusions. Enlightenment is beyond the grasp of ordinary experience and can't be achieved through psychedelic use alone. </li>
<li><strong>Continued Learning with Actualized.org</strong> : Stay engaged with Actualized.org for more insights, research, and advice on psychedelics to keep grounded and avoid being led astray by fantastical experiences.</li>
