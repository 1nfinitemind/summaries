            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2gFLwkeJYB4' target='_blank'>How To Stop Being Jealous - Techniques To End Jealousy Forever</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Subtlety of Jealousy</b>: Leo describes jealousy as a very tricky and deceptive emotion that even emotionally intelligent individuals struggle with because it can remain hidden for years without realization.
</li><li><b>Types of Jealousy</b>: He identifies several forms of jealousy including sexual, relationship, status, and personal characteristics such as charm, charisma, and attractiveness. He also notes that jealousy can sometimes be misconstrued as envy.
</li><li><b>Jealousy Manifestations</b>: Leo points out that jealousy can disguise itself as frustration, anger, hatred, sadness, or loneliness, and often leads to criticism or demonization of the object of jealousy.
</li><li><b>Jealousy's Attack on Identity</b>: The core of jealousy, according to Leo, is a threat to one's identity or ego–a concoction of self–beliefs that the individual is trying to protect. The ego is also described as being self–deceptive and pretentious due to low self–esteem.
</li><li><b>Internal Happiness and Jealousy</b>: Leo explains that jealousy is a result of not finding happiness within oneself and relying too heavily on external sources, hence the feeling of threat when these sources are at risk of being taken away.
</li><li><b>Turning Inward for Jealousy's Solution</b>: The video emphasizes that the solution to jealousy is internal and requires self–reflection about one's self–image and beliefs in order to begin the journey of eradicating jealousy from within.
</li><li><b>Recognizing Jealousy as an Ego Game</b>: A key aspect of addressing jealousy is acknowledging and convincing oneself that jealousy is fundamentally a game played by the ego, which is neither genuinely threatened nor contributing positively to one's wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Destructive Nature of Jealousy</b>: Leo warns that jealousy can prevent self–actualization and can hold individuals back from achieving success in various aspects of life, advocating for the recognition that jealousy is petty and beneath the noble aspirations most people possess.
</li><li><b>Practice of Noticing Jealousy</b>: He advises practicing mindfulness by simply noticing and labeling instances of jealousy as they occur, without self–judgment, to begin managing and eventually overcoming the emotion.
</li><li><b>Jealousy Journaling</b>: Leo suggests keeping a log of moments when jealousy arises as a tool for increasing accountability and self–awareness, contributing to the process of letting go of jealousy.
</li><li><b>Vision of Noble Self</b>: He encourages viewers to cultivate a vision of themselves as noble, big human beings who transcend pettiness, fueling the motivation to address and conquer jealousy in their lives.
</li><li><b>Life Principles and Values</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of understanding one's life principles and values like honesty, integrity, and excellence. He suggests reflecting on these personal standards when faced with jealousy, as jealousy typically contradicts one's noble values and standards.
</li><li><b>Jealous Actions Leading to Unhappiness</b>: Leo discusses how jealousy–driven actions, like criticism and sabotage, do not lead to happiness or fulfillment. Instead, these actions violate personal values and lead to negative outcomes, even if they seem to accomplish short–term goals.
</li><li><b>Control and Fear from Jealousy</b>: Leo points out the toxicity of trying to control others due to jealousy, highlighting it induces a constant state of fear and defensiveness, which is incompatible with achieving happiness.
</li><li><b>Happiness Comes from Within</b>: He stresses that external objects do not genuinely contribute to happiness. Leo explains that happiness and peace of mind come internally, so relying on external sources is misguided.
</li><li><b>Relationships Don't Ensure Happiness</b>: Leo dispels the notion that relationships provide happiness, sharing that true contentment must be developed internally, and relationships or love only amplify the happiness present within an individual.
</li><li><b>Illusion of External Achievements</b>: Leo shares a personal insight that external achievements like success in business or acquiring material possessions do not result in true happiness, insisting on the need for internal contentment.
</li><li><b>Applying Mindfulness to Jealousy</b>: He suggests using mindfulness to observe jealousy without judgment, to recognize it in the moment, and to understand the underlying reasons for its occurrence.
</li><li><b>Persistence to Overcome Jealousy</b>: Leo encourages constant practice and persistent application of self–honesty and mindfulness as a means to effectively confront and eventually dissipate jealousy.
</li><li><b>Exploring the Feeling of Threat</b>: Leo examines why feelings of being threatened emerge, such as fear of not being loved enough or worries about lifelong loneliness, encouraging viewers to introspect the deeper reasons behind these fears to understand the protective nature of their self–image.
</li><li><b>Self–Image as Ideas</b>: Leo reflects on the concept of self–image as a collection of beliefs, suggesting that it is not as concrete as it appears and can be set aside temporarily to alleviate feelings of jealousy, allowing for a healthier response to situations.
</li><li><b>Aspiring to Higher Principles</b>: By consciously choosing to adopt a generous, noble stance in situations where jealousy arises, individuals can align with their higher principles and values, leading to a greater sense of personal fulfillment and happiness.
</li><li><b>Practicing Favorable Thinking</b>: Leo challenges viewers to counteract their jealousy by positively acknowledging the qualities or successes of others, whether it's admiring a neighbor's car or recognizing the beauty and potential happiness of a romantic rival.
</li><li><b>Cultivating Abundance Mindset</b>: He advocates for a shift from scarcity to abundance mindset, encouraging viewers to have faith in their own attractiveness and resources, and to wish success for others, as this promotes personal growth and combats petty jealousy.
</li><li><b>Openness vs. Protection</b>: Leo touches on the importance of being open and trusting rather than overly protective and closed off due to the ego's influence, arguing that this openness can lead to better opportunities and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Building Inner Resilience</b>: By adopting an abundance mindset and challenging scarcity beliefs, Leo explains how to expand one's sense of abundance, thereby increasing the capacity for self–confidence and love.
</li><li><b>Practical Techniques to Overcome Jealousy</b>: He suggests various techniques such as mindfulness, learning about ego, self–esteem work, affirmations, visualizations, and meditation as means to combat jealousy and discover inner happiness.
</li><li><b>Consistent Practice for Lasting Change</b>: Leo emphasizes that overcoming jealousy requires commitment to continuous practice of the techniques shared, ensuring that jealousy is conquered over time.
</li><li><b>Engagement and Continuing Education</b>: Concluding the video, Leo invites viewers to engage with the content, sign up for his newsletter, and access additional resources to further their journey of self–actualization and emotional well–being.
