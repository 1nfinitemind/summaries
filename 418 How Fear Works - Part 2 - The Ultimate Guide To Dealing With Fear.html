            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/3ouiCKtqbCo' target='_blank'>How Fear Works - Part 2 - The Ultimate Guide To Dealing With Fear</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Appreciation for Fear's Role in Survival</b>: Fear is a fundamental mechanism that has allowed humans to survive. Without it, we wouldn't be alive today. It is important to acknowledge the role of fear in survival, even as we strive to transcend it for higher pursuits beyond basic survival.
</li><li><b>Understanding Fear is Relative</b>: Fear is highly subjective; it is relative to personal identity, environment, upbringing, and numerous other factors. What one fears, others may find absurd, underscoring the self–biased nature of fear.
</li><li><b>The Illusory Nature of Personal Fears</b>: Leo illustrates how individual fears are essentially imaginary constructs, highly subjective and irrelevant to others. He shares an anecdote of his grandmother's irrational fear of a rubber snake to highlight the power of imagination in creating fear.
</li><li><b>Existential Fear is Self Fear</b>: At the deepest existential level, all fear is rooted in a fear of oneself. This concept becomes clearer when understanding 'self' in the much broader, more accurate sense of being the entire universe or infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Being Infinite Generates Fear</b>: Leo argues that consciousness is fundamentally terrified of its own infinite scope. Since everything one dislikes or fears is included within one's consciousness, fear ultimately is about fearing the vast extent of oneself.
</li><li><b>Life's Existential Challenge</b>: Leo presents the existential challenge of life as the struggle to break through limited self–identification. Personal growth involves expanding one's identity to accept more of reality and ultimately, to recognize oneself as the infinite universe.
</li><li><b>God Realization and Shedding Fear</b>: The process of accepting oneself as God–realizing there is no separation between self and other–is presented as the ultimate journey of life. Most people resist acknowledging their true nature due to fear, preferring a strict division between self and other, which is where fear originates.
</li><li><b>Denial of One's True Nature as Source of Fear</b>: By not accepting that they are God and instead clinging to a limited identity, individuals experience fear. This denial leads to the creation of an 'other' which is defended against, further intensifying fear.
</li><li><b>Fear as a Lack of Distinction Between Self and Other</b>: Fear consequently arises from the illusion of separation between self, other, reality, and God, as these distinctions are ultimately unfounded and stem from a limited form of consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Path to Transcendence</b>: By expanding one's sense of self, moving from a limited form to an unlimited form, one moves toward a radical state of consciousness where all fear disappears due to the collapse of distinction between self and other.
</li><li><b>Understanding God in Relation to Fear</b>: Leo explains that God is the embodiment of total self–acceptance and the absence of fear, where one's consciousness becomes fully aware of itself and the made–up distinctions between self, other, and reality dissolve.
</li><li><b>The Difficulty of Achieving True Fearlessness</b>: True fearlessness necessitates multiple deep awakenings, extensive rewiring of lifelong habits, and a commitment to emotional mastery, which is a challenging process that very few, like hardcore mystics, have the potential to undergo.
</li><li><b>Practical Improvement Over Perfection</b>: Leo emphasizes that one does not need to achieve a mythical state of fearlessness to improve their quality of life significantly. Managing and reducing fear can be a practical goal with noticeable benefits, abandoning the notion of perfectionism.
</li><li><b>Fear vs. the Importance of Life</b>: The average person is unlikely to embrace radical fearlessness because it requires a full surrender of life and everything that one holds dear, a concept that is too demanding and profound for most.
</li><li><b>Leo's Experience with Fear and Fearlessness</b>: Leo shares his personal insights that while he experiences fear, he has also encountered states of consciousness devoid of fear. His journey suggests that incremental progress is valuable and the practical goal should not be the eradication of all fear but rather the reduction of it.
</li><li><b>Facing Specific Fears vs. Transcending Fear in General</b>: Leo distinguishes between addressing specific fears individually and the broader pursuit of transcending fear as a whole, noting that while the former can yield practical benefits, the latter involves existential work and deep awakenings.
</li><li><b>The Infinite Nature of Fear as a Challenge</b>: The reality of fear is inexhaustible due to the infinite nature of reality itself, meaning that there will always be new fears to confront even as old ones are resolved, unless one tackles the foundational existential issue.
</li><li><b>Fear as an Infinite Game Unless Addressed at the Root</b>: To break free from the cycle of fear, one must grapple with the infinite nature of fear and address it at the root level, surrendering completely to the concept of infinity which is a demanding, life–altering decision.
</li><li><b>Fear as a Distinct Feeling</b>: Fear is recognized as a unique feeling sensed within the body, separate from other emotions like anger or happiness. Mindfulness practice aids in distinguishing fear from other feelings, which is crucial as people often confuse fear with emotions like anger.
</li><li><b>Truth Behind Fear</b>: Leo addresses the relativity of fear, distinguishing between absolute and relative truths. Absolute truth deems all fear as false perception, while relative truth acknowledges that fear can signal legitimate danger to whatever one identifies with, making it contextually justified.
</li><li><b>Justified Fear by Geography</b>: Leo points out that the legitimacy of fear can depend on geographical context. For example, Americans may have an irrational fear of invasion due to America's military might, whereas North Koreans may justifiably fear invasion due to geopolitical dynamics.
</li><li><b>Existential View on Fear</b>: Even when fear seems justified in a relative sense, from an existential and spiritual viewpoint, all fear is ultimately a distortion because it is tied to the survival of an identity that we cling to.
</li><li><b>Danger in Eliminating Fear</b>: Leo poses a radical perspective that true elimination of fear entails a willingness to let go of attachment to life. To fully release fear requires accepting the idea of death, yet he clarifies that this doesn't necessarily mean physically dying.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Wisdom Over Fear</b>: Instead of fear, Leo champions consciousness, awareness, and wisdom as more effective tools for survival and protection. These attributes allow someone to navigate dangers rationally without being driven by fear.
</li><li><b>Caution Versus Fear</b>: A distinction is made between caution, the awareness of potential risks, and fear, the emotional response. Caution involves planning and rational action without the crippling sensation of fear, allowing for preparedness without panic.
</li><li><b>Examples of Caution</b>: Leo cites examples such as carrying protection in bear territory and implementing data backups for his business as instances of caution–driven measures, devoid of fear but marked by foresight and rational planning.
</li><li><b>Preparation and Wisdom in the Face of Fear</b>: Sharing an anecdote of his LSD trip in bear territory, Leo illustrates how he took cautious measures to ensure safety, which required staying close to a vehicle and limiting his own dosage for alertness, demonstrating practical caution over fear.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's personal bear encounter</b>: Relays a personal experience where fear and caution were tested during a camping trip with a companion while both were under the influence of LSD. They heard heavy footsteps, likely from a bear, and reacted by making noise and hastily evacuating the area, illustrating the practical application of fear and caution in a potentially dangerous situation.
</li><li><b>Being fearless vs. being reckless</b>: Leo emphasizes that being fearless doesn't mean being reckless. Acknowledging real dangers and responding properly to them is crucial, even as one strives to become fearless.
</li><li><b>Fear is relative to attachments</b>: Discusses how fear is connected to the relative value we place on things like business, relationships, or life itself. Recognizes that while these attachments persist, considerations of fear and caution will also remain relevant.
</li><li><b>Corruption of religious teachings by fear</b>: Criticizes organized religions that use fear to control behavior as misrepresentations of a loving God, suggesting that these institutions project their own egoic fears and judgment onto the concept of divinity.
</li><li><b>Science influenced by fear</b>: Argues that the scientific community is not immune to fear, particularly fears that challenge the scientific identity, such as mysticism, subjectivity, and the loss of credibility.
</li><li><b>Facing fear head–on</b>: Advises directly confronting one's fears rather than seeking escapism, as avoidance only strengthens the grip of fear.
</li><li><b>Proactively engaging in challenging situations</b>: Encourages proactive and bold decision–making to push out of comfort zones, promoting personal growth and the mitigation of fear.
</li><li><b>Overcoming fear through practice and exposure</b>: Spotlights methods such as practicing public speaking to diminish fear, advocating for ongoing training, exposure, and mindfulness as tools to overcome fears.
</li><li><b>Bold decision–making to overcome fear</b>: Leo shares his personal experience of quitting a good job to start his own business, noting that the bold decision helped him confront and overcome various fears, developing his self–esteem and confidence.
</li><li><b>Committing to or ending relationships as acts of courage</b>: He encourages taking decisive actions in relationships, whether it be committing to a new one despite fear of commitment or ending a dysfunctional relationship, to push beyond comfort zones and build courage.
</li><li><b>Approaching someone you're attracted to</b>: Leo suggests using the discomfort of attraction as a prompt to approach someone, emphasizing that this can help erode fears related to rejection or self–image.
</li><li><b>Career boldness</b>: Examples of bold actions in a career context include asking for a raise or pursuing a life purpose, with Leo highlighting that such actions contribute to personal growth by challenging fears.
</li><li><b>Moving to a new country for personal growth</b>: Leo cites a friend's experience of moving to Colombia as an example of a bold move that resulted in overcoming fears and personal development.
</li><li><b>Balance between boldness and recklessness</b>: He stresses the importance of being bold but not reckless, advising to make well–considered decisions rather than impulsive ones that could lead to regret or danger.
</li><li><b>Overcoming fear through training and exposure</b>: Leo equates training with repeated exposure, suggesting that fears often diminish with increased exposure and experience.
</li><li><b>Addressing fear of public speaking</b>: Join Toastmasters and give multiple speeches as a practical approach to overcoming the common fear of public speaking through regular exposure.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness practice as a tool for fear management</b>: Consistent mindfulness practice is recommended to become less reactive and more comfortable with the feeling of fear, leading to a decrease in its impact over time.
</li><li><b>Being present to alleviate fear</b>: Staying present in the moment rather than projecting into the future is presented as a technique to counter fear, but Leo notes it requires prior meditation practice to effectively control the mind.
</li><li><b>Fear and the Future</b>: Fear is linked to future projections rather than the present danger. Even if a bear is present, the fear comes from imagining future harm the bear may cause, not its current presence.
</li><li><b>Existential and Absolute View on Fear</b>: To transcend all fears, one must apply techniques even in the face of real danger, which includes accepting the possibility of death and letting go of the attachment to life.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as Tools for Confronting Fear</b>: Psychedelics force a confrontation with existential fears, dissolving boundaries and dualities between self and other, showing effectiveness in clinical studies for managing PTSD and end–of–life fears.
</li><li><b>Kriya Yoga to Rewire Mind and Nervous System</b>: Kriya Yoga, a meditative practice rather than physical, helps in rewiring the mind and nervous system to deal with fear, bypassing the physical postures commonly associated with yoga.
</li><li><b>Contemplation with a Journal for Fear Analysis</b>: Using a journal to contemplate fears helps identify their sources and connections to identity and ego, yet contemplation alone is insufficient to conquer fear–reason alone cannot overcome fear.
</li><li><b>Sedona Method/Letting Go Technique</b>: Actively acknowledging fear and choosing to let it go can significantly alter one's relationship with fear, useful in everyday situations, and extends to managing other negative emotions.
</li><li><b>Breathing Techniques During Fearful States</b>: Consciously slow and deep breathing allows one to relax the body and alleviate the physiological responses to fear, which can be practiced in various stress–inducing situations.
</li><li><b>Visualization and Law of Attraction Against Fear</b>: Overwhelming fear with a positive vision and consistently visualizing positive outcomes can crowd out fear, leading to better decision–making and potentially improving the situation.
</li><li><b>Daily Visualization to Combat Fear</b>: Leo emphasizes the effect of daily visualization on managing fear. He suggests consistently visualizing positive outcomes, rather than dwelling on negative thoughts. This shifts one's focus, ultimately enhancing confidence and increasing the chances of successful encounters.
</li><li><b>Visualization Does Not Guarantee Success</b>: Despite promoting visualization, Leo clarifies that visualizing positive scenarios is not about guaranteeing success, but rather about programming oneself for positivity and confidence, which can lead to better performance and experiences.
</li><li><b>Visualization as Proactive Creation</b>: Visualization is portrayed as a technique for active life engagement. By visualizing positive scenarios, one becomes a proactive creator in their life, cultivating empowering and positive expectations.
</li><li><b>Love as the Antithesis of Fear</b>: Leo posits that love, expressed as gratitude and selfless service, is the ultimate solution to overcoming fear. These acts shift focus from selfish concerns to a broader, more loving perspective, counteracting fear.
</li><li><b>Gratitude Practice to Dissolve Fear</b>: Leo encourages developing a gratitude practice where one spends time each day focusing on aspects of life to be grateful for, effectively diminishing space for fear–related emotions.
</li><li><b>Selfless Service as a Means to Overcome Fear</b>: Leo recommends engaging in selfless acts and aligning one's work with a meaningful life purpose that contributes to the betterment of mankind, counteracting fear through expressions of love.
</li><li><b>The Power of Understanding Fears</b>: Leo highlights the power of knowing someone's fears for predicting their behavior, which can aid in effective communication and addressing fears in a positive or manipulative way, with the latter leading to negative consequences or "bad karma".
</li><li><b>Assessing and Alleviating Other's Fears</b>: Leo encourages understanding other people's fears to step into their perspectives, providing solutions that can establish rapport and effective leadership, and cautions against exploiting fears for personal gain.
</li><li><b>Fear as Motivation in Business</b>: Businesses, according to Leo, often operate by addressing common fears. Understanding the fears of clients or target audiences can lead to successful products or solutions, provided it's done with a positive intention rather than exploitation.
</li><li><b>Building Rapport Through Addressing Fears</b>: Leo recommends inquiring about people's fears to build rapport and provide solutions to them. Asking personal questions, such as what keeps someone up at night, can lead to greater understanding and connectivity.
</li><li><b>Inquiry into Others' Fears</b>: Asking others about their fears can reveal the egoistic nature of one's own fears and is a useful exercise for those interested in leadership and communication.
</li><li><b>Understanding Others to Self–Reflect</b>: By understanding the fears of different people, one can see the limited and selfish aspects of fear, aiding in the recognition of the absurdity of their own fears.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Fear as Life's Purpose</b>: Leo explains that life is fundamentally about confronting oneself and the universe, understanding that the universe is an extension of oneself, and that the true source of fear is the immense scope of one's own existence.
</li><li><b>Fear of Infinity and Love</b>: The paradox is that fear isn't about confronting evil; it's the fear of accepting infinite love and unity, which threatens the individual's limited ego and petty attachments.
</li><li><b>Fear as an Obstacle to Success</b>: The inability to overcome fear and the choices made out of fear are the surest ways to fail in all aspects of life, including relationships, career, and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Fearlessness Equals Exploration</b>: Emphasizes the importance of exploring oneself and the world, equating the quality of fearlessness with success and a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Synonyms for Fearlessness</b>: Fearlessness is synonymous with love, courage, and consciousness, and is the most crucial quality required for living a good life.
</li><li><b>Fear Experience vs. Succumbing to Fear</b>: Fearlessness doesn't mean the absence of fear; it means feeling fear but not allowing it to dictate your decisions and actions.
</li><li><b>Observing Fear in Daily Life</b>: Regular observation of how fear influences life choices is a vital practice that provides insight into the existential mechanics of fear.
</li><li><b>Emotional Mastery as Lifelong Work</b>: Leo stresses that mastering emotions is a complex endeavor that requires patience and is more challenging than awakening. It's essential to work on emotional mastery and awakening simultaneously.
</li><li><b>Incremental Progress and Patience</b>: Understanding and managing emotions is a long–term investment, with incremental progress achievable while recognizing it's a lifetime's work.
