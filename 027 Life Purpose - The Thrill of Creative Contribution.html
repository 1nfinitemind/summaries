            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6CWyUuMbegk' target='_blank'>Life Purpose - The Thrill of Creative Contribution</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Star Trek Nexus analogy</b>: Leo likens himself to the Star Trek villain chasing a sense of euphoric nostalgia called the Nexus, paralleling his own pursuit of fulfilling creative contribution.
</li><li><b>Launching a passion project after college</b>: To become a game designer, Leo worked eight months on creating a mod for the game Oblivion, named La Spires, hoping to land a job in the industry.
</li><li><b>Unexpected success of La Spires</b>: The project not only served as a portfolio piece but became the number one mod for Oblivion with over a hundred thousand downloads, validating Leo's design sensibilities.
</li><li><b>Experiencing validation and joy</b>: Leo describes the satisfaction and pride from both the creative process and the positive reception of La Spires, emphasizing how it brought joy and value to players.
</li><li><b>The quest for creative fulfillment</b>: Leo discusses how for five years after La Spires' release, he sought to experience the same level of creative engagement and fulfillment in his professional career.
</li><li><b>Financially stable but creatively unfulfilled</b>: Despite securing a job as a professional game designer, the initial fulfillment dwindled, leading Leo to realize that he wanted to recapture the sense of contribution he felt during his personal project.
</li><li><b>Striving to regain creative contribution</b>: Leo expresses the importance of creative work and the pursuit of joy it brings, making a distinction between a job, a career, and a life calling.
</li><li><b>Impact of creative work on happiness</b>: Leo highlights the profound positive impact generated by contributing to others' happiness through creative work that is personally fulfilling and enriching to society.
</li><li><b>Rekindling Creative Contribution</b>: Leo is beginning to experience again the rewarding feeling of creative contribution with the launch of his personal development blueprint, characterized by a tingling sensation similar to the one he had five years ago, prior to receiving any public reactions.
</li><li><b>Creative Autonomy in Team Environments</b>: Working in big team environments as a professional game designer led to a diluted sense of creative contribution for Leo, contradicting his expectations that working on larger projects would increase that feeling.
</li><li><b>Realization Leading to Entrepreneurship</b>: The lack of creative fulfillment in team settings prompted Leo to conclude that establishing his own business was necessary for regaining the sense of creative contribution he valued so deeply.
</li><li><b>Loss of Passion and Shift to Internet Marketing</b>: Transitioning from game design to internet marketing was a strategic move for Leo to gain financial independence with the ultimate goal of starting his own game studio. Despite achieving financial success, Leo's passion for game design diminished, leading him to focus solely on internet marketing.
</li><li><b>Complacency and Rationalization</b>: As time passed, Leo's yearning for creative contribution faded. The initial euphoria he experienced became less tangible, resulting in complacency and rationalizations about his comfortable life.
</li><li><b>Soul–Searching and Purpose Transition</b>: Dissatisfaction with internet marketing led Leo to soul–search and look for a new life purpose aside from game design, ultimately leading him to personal development and coaching.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Creative Expression</b>: Crafting a unique and expressive website as part of his new direction presented Leo with significant creative challenges, insecurities, and self–doubt.
</li><li><b>Desire for Unique Creative Contribution</b>: Leo's drive to create a website that reflected his personal journey illustrates his continued pursuit of unique creative contribution, despite the obstacles encountered.
</li><li><b>Creative challenges and emotional toil</b>: Leo describes the difficulties of dealing with self–doubt, self–sabotage, and resistance that accompany the pursuit of creative passions. Despite these challenges, he feels he's finally getting back on track after a five–year journey.
</li><li><b>Transition from initial passion to new direction</b>: Leo reflects on his journey of discovering his passion, losing it, and then finding a new passion. He emphasizes the hard work and perseverance required through this transition phase.
</li><li><b>Difficulty in conveying abstract concept of creative contribution</b>: Communicating the essence of creative contribution is challenging for Leo. He likens it to describing an orgasm or the taste of a ripe peach to someone who has never experienced these sensations–a transcendental experience difficult to articulate.
</li><li><b>Creative contribution as a peak experience and self–development</b>: Leo highlights the rarity of experiencing peak states of consciousness and urges people to seek creative contribution as a fundamental aspect of life, supported by the advice of many career and self–development experts.
</li><li><b>Contribution through unique strengths</b>: He differentiates between generic acts of service and contributions that utilize one's unique talents, emphasizing the powerful and personal fulfillment that comes with the latter.
</li><li><b>Reimagining contribution in terms of gifts and passion</b>: Instead of contributing to the world indirectly through monetary gains, Leo encourages finding ways to contribute directly through personal strengths, which he believes is a more impactful approach.
</li><li><b>Realigning work with personal strengths for more impact</b>: Leo discusses the idea that working in unfulfilling roles for financial reward, despite the noble intention of donating to charity or supporting family, is less powerful than realigning one's work with their natural gifts for greater personal fulfillment and impact.
</li><li><b>Personal anecdote on impactful contribution</b>: Using his own experiences, Leo shares how he contributes through his strengths in analytical thinking and disseminating practical psychology, which brings personal satisfaction along with the potential for financial compensation.
</li><li><b>Creative contribution's potential for joy and financial success</b>: He argues that the joy derived from creative contribution is priceless and also highlights how it can lead to financial success, provided one is willing to introspect and explore.
</li><li><b>Challenging journey to unique creative contribution</b>: Leo admits the path to finding one's unique contribution is fraught with uncertainty, highlighting his own five–year journey and the importance of resources such as coaching and seminars.
</li><li><b>Motivation to pursue fulfillment and live without regrets</b>: He concludes by underscoring the importance of motivation and the drive for a fulfilling life. Leo encourages viewers to have the courage to soul–search and explore new possibilities, even if it means short–term sacrifices.
