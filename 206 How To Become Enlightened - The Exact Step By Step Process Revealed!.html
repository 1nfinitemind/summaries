            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/GfqLdOgoB98' target='_blank'>How To Become Enlightened - The Exact Step By Step Process Revealed!</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's Introduction</strong> : Leo starts by stating the video is advanced and not for beginners. He emphasizes that his intention is to provide a practical, no-nonsense guide on progressing towards enlightenment, avoiding as much mysticism as possible. </li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Nature of Awareness</strong> : Leo revisits the concept of awareness, affirming that we are not entities within our bodies, but rather the entire field of awareness itself, which is fundamentally nothingness. He warns against adopting this as philosophy, urging the viewer to seek experiential understanding beneath beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Conceptual Traps</strong> : Enlightenment is misrepresented and encumbered by philosophy, beliefs, and false assumptions. Leo stresses avoiding these traps, focusing instead on a direct experience of reality as it presents itself in the present moment. </li>
<li><strong>Speed of Enlightenment</strong> : Leo suggests that dedicated, intensive work on enlightenment can yield results in as little as 3-24 months, as opposed to the decades it traditionally takes. He views this accelerated process as possible by following his guidelines. </li>
<li><strong>Inadequacy of Meditation Alone for Enlightenment</strong> : While Leo values meditation for calming the mind, he asserts that enlightenment requires more direct, focused inquiry into consciousness than meditation alone can provide. </li>
<li><strong>The Process - A Non-Process</strong> : Leo outlines what appears to be a process for enlightenment but clarifies that enlightenment is not a process&mdash;it is an instantaneous reality, the realization of which is paradoxically uncontrolled and cannot be forced. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Steps for Increasing Awareness</strong> : Leo proposes a practical "process" where one sits quietly, assumes a meditative posture, and introspects for 30-60 minutes. The goal is to identify and observe the real-time, present sense of self-identity as it shifts within the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Discovering Self-Identity</strong> : Through introspection, individuals peel away layers of assumed identity, such as the body, and narrow down to the underlying belief that one is the perceiver of all sensations, converging on a point within. </li>
<li><strong>Realizing the Perceiver as a False Belief</strong> : Leo emphasizes that this belief in being the perceiver is a deep-held false belief and guides the listener to look even deeper to find the reality of their existence beyond even this point of perception. While acknowledging the potential process, Leo reiterates the irony that enlightenment is inherently spontaneous and can't be achieved through a traditional 'process,' but that his outlined steps may bolster one's readiness for spontaneous realization. </li>
<li><strong>Who is Aware</strong> : Leo suggests a process of self-inquiry starting with the question "Who is aware?" This question prompts one to consider who is aware of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, moving beyond mere identification with the internal dialogue. </li>
<li><strong>Differentiating Perceiving from the Perceiver</strong> : The second question Leo proposes is "Who is perceiving?" It invites introspection to identify if there's an actual entity within that perceives the senses, feelings, and body sensations, challenging the assumption of a central perceiver. </li>
<li><strong>The Question of "Who Am I"</strong> : Leo discusses the classic question "Who am I?" and its importance in the enlightenment process. He explains that understanding the question is a milestone in itself and that the search for an answer is not logical but experiential. </li>
<li><strong>Searching for Existential Being, Not Logical Answers</strong> : Leo emphasizes searching for an experiential understanding of one's existential being rather than conceptual answers. The truth about one's nature lies beyond stories of being made of atoms, a body, or having a soul. </li>
<li><strong>Going Meta on the Internal Voice</strong> : Leo instructs viewers to observe the internal voice that provides a narrative during self-inquiry. One should notice that identifying with this voice is a misunderstanding and continue to ask who perceives this voice, moving up levels of awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing the Illusion</strong> : Leo emphasizes recognizing the voice and the thinker's illusory nature, leading to the realization that every answer it provides is not the true self but rather more perceptions. </li>
<li><strong>Keeping an Open Mind</strong> : He underscores the importance of maintaining an open mind by acknowledging that one's true self is unknown and uncharacterized by the beliefs and identities held throughout life. </li>
<li><strong>Quantum Leap Intent</strong> : Leo highlights the need to approach enlightenment with the intention to make a quantum leap from seeing oneself as just a perceiver to realizing oneself as being itself, or all of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Refocusing Awareness</strong> : Leo discusses the challenge of constantly refocusing one's awareness back onto the true self, past the mind's distractions; emphasizing the importance of direct experience in recognizing who one truly is. </li>
<li><strong>Thinking vs. Looking</strong> : Leo distinguishes between thinking and looking, stating that one must apply pure awareness and observation, rather than thought, to successfully engage in the process of enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Regular Practice for Enlightenment</strong> : Leo advises practicing this focused self-inquiry for 30 to 60 minutes daily, similarly to a meditation habit, yet with more precision and dedication towards self-realization. </li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Thoughts</strong> : Thoughts are not just continuous mental activities; they are sensations that come with a story or content. They are like movies&mdash;light projected onto a screen; what appears significant is actually the result of being engrossed in the narrative rather than the existential reality of the light flickering on the wall. </li>
<li>Direct Experience of Thoughts: Leo invites you to experience the distinction between the content of a thought and the sensation it actually is. For instance, imagining a million dollars in your bank account: the story is fictitious, but the actual sensation of thinking it holds a reality on its own. This distinction is crucial for enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>All Reality is Now</strong> : Only current sensory experiences constitute reality. If something isn't in your immediate senses&mdash;seen, heard, smelled, tasted, touched, or thought of&mdash;it isn't real. Our brains are skilled at creating stories, but anything not directly experienced in the present is just a fiction. </li>
<li><strong>Mind Opening Challenges</strong> : When you attempt to understand new concepts, your mind opens up, but it can quickly be bombarded with additional content, or thoughts, that reinforce the illusion. Overcoming this cycle requires conscious effort and the ability to observe thoughts without getting absorbed in their content. </li>
<li><strong>Applying Enlightenment Principles</strong> : Leo emphasizes the usefulness of the principle that only the present is real, acknowledging it's a tough practice to maintain. He believes firmly grasping and applying this principle can lead to full enlightenment but requires extraordinary dedication and awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Common Enlightenment Traps</strong> : Avoid taking any ideas, beliefs, or instructions&mdash;including those from Leo&mdash;as the absolute truth. True existential metaphysical truth must be discovered personally. He also encourages setting aside scientific and religious explanations, as they can obstruct direct understanding of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Personal Enlightenment Journey</strong> : Leo shares that he has also fallen into enlightenment traps, such as conceptualizing enlightenment as nothingness due to excessive studying. However, only personal experience, beyond just intellectual comprehension, can lead to true enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Tips for Approaching Enlightenment</strong> : Dedicate yourself to constantly discerning the real from the fictitious. Question every idea or belief you encounter, maintain a high awareness, and never mistake the tools meant to awaken you for the actual awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception About Nothingness</strong> : Leo highlights how people misconceive nothingness, noting that if one truly understood it, they would already be enlightened. He emphasizes that his teachings also apply to himself and admits to falling into the trap of believing he knows everything about enlightenment when, in reality, he knows nothing. </li>
<li><strong>Conceptualizing Enlightenment is a Trap</strong> : Leo warns against the trap of trying to conceptualize enlightenment and oneself. He explains that any belief or idea held is not the absolute truth and that enlightenment cannot be thought into existence. </li>
<li><strong>Analogy of a Dog and Calculus</strong> : Using the analogy of a dog unable to learn calculus, Leo illustrates the futility of trying to think your way into enlightenment. He suggests that like a dog, we are limited by our habitual actions and must transcend them through awareness and observation rather than thought. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Massive Persistence</strong> : Leo stresses that enlightenment requires extraordinary mental effort and resilience. He acknowledges that one will likely face numerous challenges, including disheartenment and existential crises, but urges persistence and refinement of approach despite failure. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as a Spontaneous Awakening</strong> : Describing enlightenment as a spontaneous awakening that cannot be predicted or forced, Leo notes that such a breakthrough might happen unexpectedly, even if one is following a process meant to increase its likelihood. </li>
<li><strong>Being as Reality</strong> : During enlightenment, Leo explains that you become an expansive form of reality that is not limited or located anywhere in particular. This unrestricted being is experienced during a moment of enlightenment, which can be profoundly transformative. </li>
<li><strong>Cyclical Nature of Enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment is presented as a continual pursuit, with cycles of awakening and falling back into ignorance. Leo emphasizes the deep gratitude and worth of this journey despite its challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Continued Learning</strong> : Leo suggests watching more of his videos to further understand enlightenment and overcome various traps and challenges. He discourages taking his teachings as absolute truth and emphasizes the practical application of the concepts discussed. </li>
<li><strong>Dismissing Beliefs Before Enlightenment Work</strong> : Emphasizing the need to clear out one's belief systems, Leo recommends a period of dismissing one's entrenched beliefs to engage in more focused and effective enlightenment practices. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Enlightenment Work</strong> : Although challenging, Leo concludes that the work towards enlightenment is exceptionally worthwhile and encourages viewers to subscribe to his channel for advanced topics. He reminds viewers that his teachings should not be mistaken as absolute truth.</li>
