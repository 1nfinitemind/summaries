            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/BqWPqZK-Ikg' target='_blank'>65 Core Principles Of Living The Good Life</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Actualized.org as a comprehensive system</b>: Leo describes Actualized.org as a unique, non–ideological personal development system that offers a big–picture perspective on creating a fulfilling life. He emphasizes grounding teachings in direct experience and self–experimentation to avoid dogma.
</li><li><b>No ideology and no dogma principle</b>: Leo highlights the importance of being free from ideologies and dogmas, which can limit one's understanding of reality, affecting their ability to authentically explore life and change for the better.
</li><li><b>Big–picture thinking over technical knowledge</b>: Leo advocates for a focus on overarching principles that shape a good life, rather than getting lost in technical details, which can detract from true understanding and personal happiness.
</li><li><b>Direct experience as the most significant reality</b>: Leo emphasizes that what is directly experienced in the present moment is the only true reality, helping to cut through societal, cultural, and personal delusions.
</li><li><b>Self–experimentation for personal truth</b>: Leo encourages trying diverse techniques and solutions based on direct experience to find out what genuinely works for an individual's personal development.
</li><li><b>Radical open–mindedness for complete exploration</b>: Leo advises exploring every perspective and idea without prejudice, avoiding prejudgment traps that could close off areas of possible growth or insight.
</li><li><b>Radical Open–mindedness</b>: Recognizing that the mind tends to be closed off to new and challenging ideas, Leo advocates for radical open–mindedness. This involves being willing to explore any idea, perspective, or teaching, no matter how outlandish or false it may seem at first glance, to prevent premature judgment and open oneself to deep truths.
</li><li><b>Avoid Premature Judgment</b>: Leo cautions against judging experiences and ideas which have not been personally encountered. This principle serves as an extension of radical open–mindedness. Premature judgment can lead to self–deception, limiting understanding. Personal experience is necessary before forming credible opinions or judgments.
</li><li><b>Question Everything</b>: Leo underscores the importance of questioning all ideas, including those that seem most obvious or sacred. The more fundamental the questioning is, the deeper the understanding one can achieve. This involves scrutinizing assumptions within all systems of thought, including one's own beliefs, and shouldering the responsibility to discover truth independently.
</li><li><b>Value of Philosophical and Metaphysical Inquiry</b>: Leo emphasizes caring about philosophical and metaphysical matters for their ability to bring depth and profound insight into life. While these topics can seem disconnected from practical concerns, he believes they underlie many seemingly superficial issues, and understanding them can have significant practical applications.
</li><li><b>Genuine Intent for Truth</b>: This principle highlights the importance of putting truth above all else, even when the pursuit entails significant personal cost or sacrifice. Without prioritizing truth, Leo warns, one is likely to be ensnared by material pursuits, comfort, and falsehood.
</li><li><b>Understanding Every Point of View</b>: Encouraging a passion for comprehending various points of view, Leo suggests stepping into the perspectives of others to gain a richer and more diverse understanding of the world, which reflects that one's own perspective isn't inherently superior.
</li><li><b>Integral Thinking</b>: Integral thinking recognizes that every point of view has some truth; understanding this truth is an individual responsibility, not that of the person holding the view. This approach counters dogmatic ideologies by integrating various perspectives for a holistic understanding.
</li><li><b>Inner Game Determines Quality of Life</b>: Leo asserts that all problems and suffering are self–created; the quality of one's life hinges on inner psychology. Mastering the 'inner game' by recognizing and changing internal beliefs and perspectives is key to addressing life's challenges.
</li><li><b>Lifelong Learning and Self–Education</b>: Emphasizing the importance of proactive, continuous learning and education, Leo argues one should not end their learning journey with formal schooling but should expect to read and study extensively, well beyond traditional academic settings.
</li><li><b>Importance of reading books</b>: Books provide high–quality, varied information that can deepen understanding of personal issues, techniques, and ideas, exceeding what videos and social media offer.
</li><li><b>Value in attending live workshops</b>: Participating in in–person workshops and seminars creates a vastly more impactful learning experience compared to online attendance, worth investing in despite costs.
</li><li><b>Financial investment in self–education</b>: Embracing lifelong learning means investing money in books, courses, and live events to access high–quality information and opportunities for growth.
</li><li><b>Develop a system for organizing knowledge</b>: Building a system to organize information, such as a commonplace book, is critical for retaining and applying the wide array of concepts learned through self–education.
</li><li><b>Principle of Observation</b>: Observing everything patiently and methodically, including your behaviors and external phenomena, is fundamental for understanding reality and overcoming ideology.
</li><li><b>Meditation as a cornerstone habit</b>: Plan to meditate daily, starting with shorter sessions and building up to an hour, to deeply observe the mind and present moment, which is essential for personal understanding and growth.
</li><li><b>Ego as the root of suffering</b>: Recognizing that the ego, or the identification with the self, is the source of all personal and collective human issues is pivotal for addressing problems at their core.
</li><li><b>Recognizing self–deception</b>: Being vigilant about self–deception is crucial since the mind is adept at lying to oneself, leading to falsehoods that hinder the quest for truth.
</li><li><b>Awareness of self–bias</b>: Understanding one's own biases, which emerge from the ego's drive to survive, is necessary to avoid skewing perceptions and to achieve a truer understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Delusions of fear, judgment, evil, anger, and suffering</b>: Acknowledging these negative experiences as based on falsehoods can lead to their eradication, paving the way toward living the good life.
</li><li><b>Avoiding demonization</b>: Rejecting the tendency to label others or entities as evil is important in overcoming self–deceptive mechanisms and understanding the delusory nature of such judgments.
</li><li><b>Perfection of reality principle</b>: The notion that reality is inherently perfect and that perceptions of wrongness are due to personal limitations can drive self–growth and understanding.
</li><li><b>Reality is Perfect Principle</b>: Consider seeing reality as perfect and understanding that perceived imperfections are projections of our own judgments.
</li><li><b>Four Perspectives on Life's Purpose</b>: Leo highlights overarching life purposes: raising consciousness, increasing capacity to love, appreciating beauty in all aspects of life, and feeling alive and engaged every day.
</li><li><b>Raising Consciousness</b>: Dedicate yourself daily to the goal of expanding your awareness and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Expanding Love</b>: Aim to love more broadly, embracing not only pleasant experiences but the full spectrum of life, which involves ego surrender.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Beauty</b>: Train yourself to find beauty in the mundane as well as the extraordinary to live a fully appreciative life.
</li><li><b>Feeling Alive and Engaged</b>: Strive to live each day with passion and purpose, avoiding a robotic or monotonous existence.
</li><li><b>Building a Metaphysical Connection to Reality</b>: Develop a deeper understanding that we are part of the entire universe, enhancing our connection with existence itself.
</li><li><b>Reality's Counterintuitiveness</b>: Acknowledge that reality often functions in ways opposite to initial expectations and leverage this understanding to achieve life goals.
</li><li><b>Non–duality as Ultimate Truth</b>: Recognize that all distinctions and dualities are relative and ultimately collapse into a unified reality.
</li><li><b>Existence of Absolute Truth</b>: Accept that while absolute truth exists, it cannot be communicated or proven, and is only experiential.
</li><li><b>Reality as a Mindscape</b>: Understand that what we perceive as physical reality is actually part of a vast imagination within a mind, not something external.
</li><li><b>Life as a Dream Principle</b>: Leo emphasizes the principle that life is akin to a dream, with the "external world" being a part of this dream, thereby encouraging dis–identification from attachments and reducing the seriousness with which we treat life's events.
</li><li><b>Reality and Infinity Principle</b>: Leo explains that reality is infinite and associates the term "God" not with a religious figure but rather with the concept of infinity, suggesting that reality and God are deeply misunderstood and warrant further exploration through resources like his series on absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>You are God Principle</b>: A radical insight Leo shares is that individuals are not separate from God; rather, each person is, in a mystical sense, God. This realization is said to come from years of deep spiritual practice and meditation, and is pivotal for taking complete responsibility for life.
</li><li><b>God is the Devil Principle</b>: Leo underlines non–duality by asserting that traditional dualities such as God and the devil collapse into one, suggesting that perceived evils in the world have a higher purpose within the infinite reality and are integral to understanding the depth of existence.
</li><li><b>All Identity is Relative and Fluid Principle</b>: Asserting that all identities are mental constructs and not absolute truths, Leo argues for the fluidity and changeability of identities, which offers the potential for individuals to identify with ultimate reality and overcome the fear of death.
</li><li><b>The Delusion of Society Principle</b>: Leo points to a widespread lack of understanding regarding the principles he discusses, highlighting the importance of not relying on societal norms and guidance, which are predominantly rooted in delusion and ignorance.
</li><li><b>Society in the Dark Ages Principle</b>: Despite living in the 21st century, Leo posits that society retains a primitive understanding of spirituality, psychology, and science akin to the medical knowledge of the dark ages, and cautions against being misled by technological facades.
</li><li><b>Development and Awakening Principle</b>: Leo stresses the necessity of both personal development within the dream of life and awakening from that dream. One cannot simply develop without awakening, or awaken without developing, as both are required to live life to its fullest potential.
</li><li><b>Discover Who You Are and What You Want Principle</b>: The principle advocates for a clear, decisive understanding of personal identity and desires, a process that requires years of contemplation and self–discovery.
</li><li><b>Authenticity as Key to a Good Life Principle</b>: Encouraging daily efforts to be more authentic, Leo explains how society often rewards inauthenticity, and how discovering your true self is essential for genuine happiness and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Develop a Life Purpose</b>: Leo highlights the critical nature of having a life purpose that aligns with one's values and aspirations, recommending his course for those seeking to find and develop their life purpose.
</li><li><b>Take 100% Responsibility Principle</b>: Emphasizing the importance of not playing the victim, Leo encourages viewers to take full responsibility for their lives to prevent feelings of alienation and unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Taking Personal Responsibility</b>: It's essential to assume the burden of solving problems rather than feeling stuck and miserable. Taking responsibility leads to resourcefulness and creativity, involving self–experimentation, research, and utilizing various resources to find solutions.
</li><li><b>Be a Leader and a Creator</b>: Leo encourages viewers to lead themselves and others, be proactive and decisive, and take risks to feel alive. Embracing creativity allows one to contribute to the world through art, technology, and other creations, thus providing massive value to society.
</li><li><b>Providing Value to Society</b>: Creating and contributing to the world fulfills a legitimate life purpose and counteracts the allure of negative ideologies that stem from a void in one's life.
</li><li><b>Unreliability of Reason</b>: Leo challenges the trust in rationality, stating that all individuals have justifiable reasons for their actions, but reason is often a post–hoc rationalization for emotional and egoic agendas.
</li><li><b>Embracing Paradox, Confusion, and Not–Knowing</b>: Accepting confusion and the unknown is crucial for personal growth, as finite models cannot capture the infinite nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Emotional Mastery</b>: Genuine emotional mastery involves deeply experiencing and understanding emotions rather than suppressing or over–expressing them. Observing emotions is key to purifying one's reasoning and achieving a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Integrating Masculine and Feminine Qualities</b>: Regardless of gender or natural inclinations, integrating both masculine and feminine qualities ensures a well–rounded personality and can prevent relationship issues.
</li><li><b>Reducing Manipulation</b>: Observing one's behaviors and reducing manipulation leads to a better quality of life, as constant manipulation is a characteristic of ego–driven actions.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Knowledge</b>: All conventional understanding and knowledge are relative, with only the Absolute Truth being non–relative. This underscores that knowledge and truth are context–dependent.
</li><li><b>Context Matters More Than Facts</b>: The situational background or context gives facts their meaning, emphasizing the need for understanding the broader circumstances surrounding knowledge claims.
</li><li><b>Learn from Diverse Sources</b>: To avoid getting trapped in a single paradigm, it's important to draw knowledge from a multitude of diverse sources, allowing for a comprehensive view of life and personal development.
</li><li><b>Diverse Sources Principle</b>: Gathering information from various perspectives and disciplines is crucial to avoid being trapped in a limiting paradigm. Studying different traditions and ideologies helps triangulate and cross–reference truths, revealing a bigger picture that cannot be seen through a single source.
</li><li><b>Satisfying Basic Needs Principle</b>: Addressing fundamental needs such as shelter, food, and relationships is key to moving beyond cravings and focusing on higher metaphysical and existential pursuits. 
</li><li><b>Mastery of Survival and Livelihood Principle</b>: Understanding basic survival and money management skills is essential for personal independence and lays the foundation for pursuing higher concepts like enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Mastery Development Principle</b>: Choosing a field to master and dedicating significant time and effort to it provides stability, enjoyment, and value to society. It prevents underachievement and enables self–sufficiency. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding Distractions Principle</b>: Being aware of and reducing distractions such as social media, ideology, and material pursuits is critical for focusing on personal development and creating a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Systems Thinking Principle</b>: Becoming a systems thinker allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of factors in life and improves problem–solving capabilities, moving away from simplistic, one–cause thinking.
</li><li><b>Good Citizenship Principle</b>: Recognizing one's ecological footprint and impact on society is vital to contribute positively to collective wellbeing and the environment.
</li><li><b>Strategic Planning Principle</b>: Being patient and strategic about achieving goals with short–term and long–term plans helps in inching towards significant life objectives through multiple stepping stones.
</li><li><b>Happiness through Enlightenment Principle</b>: Genuine happiness is tied to enlightenment; without enlightenment, happiness can be fleeting. Nevertheless, improving levels of happiness should still be pursued while on the path to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Material Possessions and Happiness Principle</b>: Material possessions will never offer true happiness. Unlike temporary contentment, true happiness is unattainable through materialistic gains or external factors.
</li><li><b>Guarantee of Material Things Not Bringing Happiness</b>: Material possessions, including knowledge and experiences like travel, are included under 'material' and cannot bring lasting happiness. Understanding this prevents wasting decades chasing after fleeting satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Ability to Be Happy Alone</b>: Training oneself to be content sitting alone, doing nothing, is critical for true happiness rather than seeking temporary excitement from social interactions or activities.
</li><li><b>Simple and Spartan Lifestyle</b>: Maintaining a minimalist lifestyle, free from excess physical clutter and social commitments, is vital to have the time for self–improvement practices like meditation and spirituality.
</li><li><b>Practical Application Through Techniques</b>: Theory alone is insufficient; 95% of results come from practicing techniques like psychedelics, meditation, meditative yoga, journaling, contemplation, visualization, and solo retreats.
</li><li><b>Avoid Converting Teachings Into Ideologies</b>: Actualized.org is not meant to be a rigid system. The teachings should be applied thoughtfully and flexibly while being mindful of their limitations and biases.
</li><li><b>Complexity and Challenge of Life</b>: Life's depth and breadth mean that understanding a few facets is not enough. Realizing this encourages continual exploration and avoids the trap of oversimplification.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Continual Effort</b>: Acknowledging the complexity of life indicates the need for sustained effort to study, verify, and implement principles, a process that unfolds over years and decades.
</li><li><b>Remembering Commitments to Growth</b>: Regular engagement with self–improvement content, like Actualized.org, acts as a reminder to stay committed to personal development and avoid falling back into old patterns.
</li><li><b>Valuing and Applying Teachings for Transformation</b>: The teachings shared can significantly change one's life. A daily commitment to change and active work leads to a powerful and fulfilling life.
