            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Oq4NDMNDzSs' target='_blank'>Enlightenment Guided Inquiry - The Neti Neti Method</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Introduction to Guided Inquiry</b>: Leo introduces a guided visualization using the neti neti method from Advaita Vedanta for initiating enlightenment experiences. This advanced method is aimed at individuals seeking to experience enlightenment directly, and Leo suggests that even those new to the concept might benefit significantly from the exercise if they approach it without preconceived notions.
</li><li><b>Preparation for the Visualization</b>: Participants are instructed to allocate 30–40 minutes for the exercise, to relax their bodies, and to follow Leo's guidance with an open mind, setting aside all pre–existing beliefs about their identity.
</li><li><b>Challenge to Identity Convictions</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of doubt and openness in the enlightenment process, challenging viewers to consider the possibility that they are not their bodies, minds, brains, thoughts, feelings, or any self–concept they have.
</li><li><b>The Definition and Role of Experience</b>: Leo defines experience broadly as everything that has happened since birth, including sensory perceptions and thoughts. He urges viewers to be open to the radical idea that they are not any experience they have ever had.
</li><li><b>Visualization Exercise Premise</b>: Adopting the premise that everything in awareness changes, including the body and personal beliefs, Leo surmises that who we are cannot be consistently tied to these changing experiences. This concept sets the stage for the detailed inquiry to follow.
</li><li><b>Summarization of Human Experience Channels</b>: Leo explores the concept that human reality is composed solely of sight, sound, taste, smell, touch (outer and inner), and thought. These six channels, constantly changing, form the entirety of our experience since birth.
</li><li><b>Inquiry into Visual Experience</b>: Leo asks if one could be merely a visual experience, inviting viewers to open their eyes and observe the changing colors and shapes, concluding that since these aspects change, one cannot be defined as a visual sight.
</li><li><b>Sound as a Constant</b>: The possibility of being a sound is dismissed because sounds change continuously, and there is no perpetual sound that could define our existence.
</li><li><b>Taste as Identity</b>: The channel of taste is quickly reviewed, noting the fluctuating nature of taste and its weak association with identity.
</li><li><b>Smell as a Defining Characteristic</b>: The smell is considered an even less likely candidate for self–identity due to its variability and the human's relatively poor sense of smell.
</li><li><b>Outer Touch as Self</b>: Exploring outer touch, Leo clarifies that no consistent outer sensation could represent who we are due to their ever–changing nature.
</li><li><b>Inner Feelings as Identity</b>: The role of inner feelings and emotions in defining self is questioned. Leo argues that these internal sensations change too frequently to be the constant essence of self.
</li><li><b>Thoughts and Self–Identification</b>: Leo breaks down the identification with thoughts into two components들nternal voice and visual thoughts듞oncluding that neither can be the constant 'self' due to their intermittent nature.
</li><li><b>Internal Voice as Self</b>: He challenges the idea that one's internal dialogue constitutes their identity, pointing out the variable nature of this inner voice.
</li><li><b>Visual Thoughts as Self</b>: Individuals are prompted to consider whether they are their visual thoughts, which also change, showing that pictures in the mind cannot define our true self.
</li><li><b>Impermanence of Mental Images</b>: Visual images in our minds, such as picturing a purple elephant, change constantly and are not continuously displayed since birth, suggesting that our identity is not tied to these fleeting images.
</li><li><b>The 'I Thought' Inspection</b>: The 'I thought'듮he internal notion of 'I exist'들s not always active (e.g., during sleep or deep engagement) and is absent frequently, indicating that our continuous identity cannot be the intermittent 'I thought'.
</li><li><b>Identification with the Body</b>: The concept of identifying with the body드 collection of thoughts, feelings, and sensations들s flawed, as these experiences are not constantly active, and the body itself changes over time.
</li><li><b>Intuition's Role in Identity</b>: Intuition, often thought to be a core sense of existence, is dissected as merely being a transient feeling or thought and not a constant, thus failing to define our true identity.
</li><li><b>Behind–The–Scenes Existence Fallacy</b>: The sense of existing 'behind the scenes' of experiences is reduced to merely another feeling or thought, negating it as the fundamental essence of our identity.
</li><li><b>The Elusive Source Self</b>: Despite exhaustive introspection, the perceiving 'source self' or the essence of our existence cannot be pinpointed or described, challenging the notion of being a tangible, locatable entity.
</li><li><b>Perceiver as Not an Experience</b>: The core realization that the 'perceiver' of experiences is not an experience itself, but remains undefined and unchanging amidst constantly changing experiences.
</li><li><b>Three Core Existential Assumptions</b>: People's fundamental assumptions about existence (being real, object–like, and located in space) are questioned for their validity since they are not based on deep existential inquiry.
</li><li><b>Possibility of Foundational Misguidance</b>: The suggestion that one's sense of identity, as an object or being located in space, could stem from lifelong societal and cultural indoctrination that hasn't been critically examined.
</li><li><b>Struggle to Define Existence</b>: Attempting to define 'what we are' with physical or experiential evidence falls short, leaving us with an intangible and elusive understanding of identity.
</li><li><b>Existential Investigation and Indoctrination</b>: An invitation to consider the role of indoctrination on our beliefs about existence and to entertain the notion that we may differ radically from our assumptions.
</li><li><b>Discovering Self–aware Nothingness</b>: A profound realization that in the failure to concretely identify the 'self,' one might actually encounter an understanding of existence as self–aware nothingness, intangible yet real.
</li><li><b>Encounter with 'Nothingness'</b>: Leo Gura describes that realizing one's true self can be understood as becoming aware of being 'nothingness'. This is an inherently self–aware state that defies traditional concepts of existence, having no color, shape, or tangible characteristics들t's an infinite, boundaryless field where all experiences occur.
</li><li><b>Guided Visualization Outcomes</b>: After the guided visualization, viewers may or may not have directly experienced 'nothingness'. Not experiencing it immediately is common and acceptable, as it usually takes multiple attempts and an open mind to achieve this realization.
</li><li><b>Transformative Experience of 'Nothingness'</b>: For those who did have a direct experience, Leo emphasizes that it's normal to feel fear due to the radical shift from one's previous self–concept. However, it is a positive and profound change, likened to awakening for the first time.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Empirical Discovery</b>: Leo clarifies that the concept of 'nothingness' is not based on belief but rather an empirical discovery that requires radical open–mindedness and persistent introspection.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Experience</b>: He also points out that colloquial usage of 'experience' does not accurately describe 'nothingness' since it transcends typical experiences and conceptions, existing outside time and space.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self–Inquiry</b>: Continuous questioning of why one assumes themselves to be a tangible object located in space is encouraged. Leo criticizes cultural and societal influences that shape such assumptions and that they might be as flawed today as they were in historical times.
</li><li><b>Combining the Mundane with the Divine</b>: Leo advocates for a blend of self–improvement (self–actualization) and the transcendence of self–concept (self–transcendence) to lead a life that is both profoundly ordinary and divinely 'extraordinary'.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Continue the Journey</b>: Leo invites viewers to stay engaged with Actualized.org for ongoing insights into mastering life from the mundane to the divine, emphasizing that the divine is accessible and integral to an extraordinary life.
