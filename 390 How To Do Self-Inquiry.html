            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/30grH6X_Q7M' target='_blank'>How To Do Self-Inquiry</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Explanation of Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo begins by expressing his enthusiasm for discussing self–inquiry during the holiday season and highlights the importance of correctly performing spiritual techniques like self–inquiry, mindfulness meditation, and yoga to achieve awakening.
</li><li><b>Trickiness of Self–Inquiry</b>: He explains that self–inquiry is deceptively simple but can be tricky to perform correctly, and improper practice can lead to discouragement, misinterpreting enlightenment as mere fantasy.
</li><li><b>Goal of Self–Inquiry</b>: The aim of self–inquiry is to discover what one truly is, both physically and existentially, by differentiating between the false self (the familiar one since birth) and the true self (the spiritual essence responsible for existence).
</li><li><b>Self–Identification Exercise</b>: Leo guides the viewer to identify what they truly believe themselves to be, asking them to disregard fantasies or spiritual beliefs, and to honestly articulate what they are deeply identified with, whether that be a physical body, a part of the body, or a soul.
</li><li><b>The False Self and Object Identification</b>: He notes that any object or part of the body that one identifies with can be observed, implying that the true self is the observer of these objects rather than the objects themselves, thus encouraging less identification with physical attributes.
</li><li><b>Concept of the True Self</b>: Leo clarifies that the true self has no properties, unlike conventional objects which occupy physical space and have characteristics. This non–physical attribute of the true self makes it difficult to find because it is purely empty awareness or consciousness.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience Exercise</b>: He encourages viewers to focus their awareness on their existence and to search within themselves for their most essential nature, emphasizing the importance of a silent mind during this process to feel into the experience without getting caught in thoughts or concepts.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Ego–mind Traps</b>: Leo warns that during self–inquiry, the ego–mind can trick individuals by either distracting them with thoughts, images, beliefs, and concepts or partially allowing access to one's true nature but then filling the void with ideas, thus preventing the discovery of the true self.
</li><li><b>False Self Constituents</b>: He asserts that one's entire life story, bodily identification, thoughts of being a biological creature, and physical conceptualizations compose the false self. The challenge lies in bypassing these and focusing purely on the inner emptiness to realize the true self.
</li><li><b>Illusion of the Ego</b>: Leo Gura discusses how one's sense of self, or ego, is built from personal history, beliefs, and perceived sensations, all of which are illusions of the true self. He challenges viewers to penetrate beyond these constructs to find what lies underneath.
</li><li><b>Confronting Skepticism in Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo urges keeping skepticism in check as self–inquiry is not about believing any specific content. Instead, like a scientist, one should remain open to discovering whatever is true about one's self.
</li><li><b>Difficulty of Overcoming Identifications</b>: Leo describes the challenge of convincing oneself that lifelong identifications with memories, body sensations, and thoughts are not the true self due to deep cultural and personal conditioning.
</li><li><b>Radical Open–Mindedness</b>: Leo emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a radically open mind to distinguish between what's real and imaginary in the journey of self–discovery.
</li><li><b>Focusing on Inner Emptiness</b>: Leo guides viewers to look inward beyond thoughts, beliefs, and physical sensations to a sense of emptiness, encouraging persistent focus on this to find the 'I am–ness' that is the true self.
</li><li><b>Resisting Conceptualization of the True Self</b>: Leo warns against the temptation to conceptualize or objectify the true self, insisting that the aim is to connect with the actuality of our being rather than forming an image or theory about it.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Maintaining Attention</b>: He acknowledges the difficulty of self–inquiry due to the modern propensity towards distraction and the lack of 'focusing muscles' required for deep introspection.
</li><li><b>Persistence in Self–Inquiry Observation</b>: Leo stresses the importance of observing the inner emptiness with patience and silence, possibly for thousands of hours, to reach an epiphanic realization of one's true self.
</li><li><b>Analogy of Observing the Unknown</b>: By comparing the practice of self–inquiry with the patient observation of a finger as an unknown object, Leo illustrates the process of direct and speculative–free observation one must apply to their inner self.
</li><li><b>Nature of Awakening Through Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo asserts that awakening or enlightenment is an epiphany realized through the dedicated practice of self–inquiry, not through verbal, conceptual, or theoretical understanding.
</li><li><b>Mind's Tendency to Daydream and Theorize</b>: He explains that during self–inquiry, the mind often gets distracted, creating theories and speculating, which hinders the process of focusing solely on inner emptiness.
</li><li><b>Building Concentration and Trust for Breakthrough</b>: Leo advises building a laser–focus concentration on the emptiness and trusting in the eventual breakthrough to actualize enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing the Input of False Self from True Self</b>: He instructs practitioners to go beyond false sensations and images that the mind conjures, seeking the perceiver–the pure subjectivity within which is the true self, separate from the biological self.
</li><li><b>Confusion Between Perceiver and Physical Self</b>: Leo describes the confusion between pure subjectivity, or the true self, and the physical self, which includes personal narrative and identity, emphasizing the necessity to discern the true perceiver amidst these conflations.
</li><li><b>Fusion of the Formed and Formless</b>: At birth, humans experience a fusion of their physical form and the pure subjectivity, the emptiness within. Self–inquiry aims to focus on this emptiness and separate it from the physical attributes, distinguishing between the true self (formlessness) and the false self (form).
</li><li><b>Biological Birth versus True Self</b>: Physical attributes like the body, personality, and genetics were born out of biological conception. In contrast, the true self – the awareness or empty space – always existed prior to and during the biological birth, with which it became fused, leading to confusion.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Attention on Emptiness</b>: Self–inquiry involves focusing awareness on the emptiness. This consistent attention allows the form and formlessness to separate progressively and ultimately leads to a profound awakening, where one becomes fully aware of the emptiness and recognizes it as the true self.
</li><li><b>Nature of Pure Subjectivity</b>: Pure subjectivity, or true awareness, has no properties–it's not big, small, colorful, nor does it occupy space or have physical attributes. Becoming aware of pure subjectivity is challenging because it defies objectification and conceptual understanding.
</li><li><b>Awareness on Awareness Exercise</b>: A practical self–inquiry exercise directs participants to initially focus awareness on their hand, an object behind the hand, and then on awareness itself, maintaining this focus until enlightenment occurs. This practice illustrates how to direct and keep attention on the pure subjectivity.
</li><li><b>Building Concentration for Self–Inquiry</b>: Preliminary practices like meditation or concentration exercises can aid in developing the necessary focus for self–inquiry, allowing individuals to maintain concentration on awareness itself despite its non–objective nature.
</li><li><b>Resisting Temptation to Objectify Awareness</b>: Participants must resist the urge to create tangible representations of awareness or tie it with science, history, or other learned concepts, as these are distractions from understanding pure subjectivity.
</li><li><b>Personal Timeframe for Awakening</b>: The time it takes to experience awakening through self–inquiry varies from person to person and can range from hours to decades. Steadfast practice often yields results within a few years, assuming distractions like body sensations are minimized.
</li><li><b>Duality to Non–Duality Journey</b>: The spiritual process initially separates the form from the formless, creating a duality that leads to a detachment from physical suffering. Full non–duality is only achieved when formlessness is reintegrated with form, revealing that the material world is an expression of spirit.
</li><li><b>Extended Nature of Learning</b>: Learning is a process of pure observation, untainted by theories or speculation. By observing something, like ants, for extended periods without interference, profound understanding can be attained, mirroring the approach needed for effective self–inquiry.
</li><li><b>Observational learning process</b>: You gain profound knowledge by observing a subject, like ants, without interference. Spending significant time, such as a hundred hours, observing quietly can lead to intimate understanding and detailed perception, distinguishing one ant from another.
</li><li><b>The mind's tendency to theorize rather than observe</b>: Most people don't truly understand the world as they prefer to theorize and hold beliefs rather than observing directly and without preconceived notions, which is essential for deeper comprehension.
</li><li><b>Objective observation in science and art</b>: Both scientists and artists must learn to observe impartially and objectively, without personal bias, to reach genuine insights. Observing without influencing the subject is the key to understanding.
</li><li><b>Self–inquiry as observation of observation</b>: Self–inquiry is about focusing on the process of observation itself. By observing how awareness functions, you engage in a meta–level of understanding, shedding light on the nature of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Challenges of a curious mind during self–inquiry</b>: An overly curious mind can obstruct the process of self–inquiry. It may interfere with the objective observation by speculating or theorizing about consciousness instead of simply observing its nature.
</li><li><b>Analogy of stable observation to a clear telescope</b>: A calm and stable mind is compared to a clear, unfogged telescope – necessary to observe a comet in the sky. Similarly, a clear mind is crucial for observing the process of awareness during self–inquiry.
</li><li><b>Preliminary practices to enhance self–inquiry</b>: For those beginning self–inquiry, preliminary meditation or concentration practices, like focusing on a finger, can train the mind for better focus during self–inquiry when the object of observation is switched to awareness itself.
</li><li><b>Illusion of self being inside the body</b>: Through self–inquiry, we can realize that the feeling of a self inside our body is an illusion. The 'ghost' we perceive is pure emptiness, without physical properties like location or size.
</li><li><b>Realization of the omnipresent true self</b>: Ultimately, through self–inquiry, one comes to understand that the true self is not confined or localized but is omnipresent emptiness, within which the entire universe exists.
</li><li><b>Importance of practice for achieving awakening</b>: Persistent daily practice of self–inquiry is essential for a breakthrough or awakening. Occasional or half–hearted attempts are insufficient, and a serious and disciplined approach is needed.
</li><li><b>Guarantee of effectiveness with serious commitment</b>: Although doubts may arise about the efficacy of self–inquiry, committing to consistent practice with focus and patience is crucial for genuinely understanding the true self and achieving realization.
</li><li><b>Continuous growth of consciousness</b>: Engaging in self–inquiry leads to the gradual expansion of consciousness, benefiting various aspects of one's life including business, relationships, and emotional well–being.
</li><li><b>Detachment through self–inquiry</b>: Gaining even slight detachment from form and formlessness reduces suffering by creating a healthy space from negative emotions and cravings, leading to less attachment in relationships and the ability to handle life's challenges more effectively.
</li><li><b>Suffering as an attribute of the false self</b>: Whenever suffering or pain is experienced, it's the false self that is affected. Recognizing this can help differentiate between the false self and the true self, which does not suffer.
</li><li><b>Non–duality through reintegration</b>: Achieving detachment is not an end but a transformation towards non–duality, allowing one to experience emotions without suffering, merging spiritual detachment with full emotional sensitivity.
</li><li><b>Practical steps for self–inquiry</b>: If self–inquiry is too difficult, preliminary practices like meditation or Kriya Yoga can help focus the mind and prepare individuals for deeper self–inquiry practices.
</li><li><b>Pitfalls of insufficient practice</b>: Simply calming the mind through meditation might not lead to awakening without direct self–inquiry on the nature of the true self and awareness.
</li><li><b>Difference between learning and doing</b>: There is a significant gap between learning about self–inquiry and actually practicing it. Intellectual understanding without practice won't lead to true awakening.
</li><li><b>Challenges of implementing insights</b>: Failing to act on spiritual knowledge can cause mental distress. Active practice is necessary to bridge the gap between understanding and living the teachings.
</li><li><b>Long–term rewards of patience and persistence</b>: The most profound benefits of self–inquiry and related practices are often realized after several years of consistent effort, requiring a long–term commitment and vision for personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Crucial action for actualization</b>: To fully actualize the teachings of self–inquiry, one must not only learn and contemplate but actively engage in the practice, despite difficulties, to experience eventual breakthroughs and self–realization.
