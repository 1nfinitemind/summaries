            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of true forgiveness</b>: True forgiveness involves both letting go and forgetting. It gives the relationship a new clean slate, free from past issues, creating an opportunity to move forward without ruminating on past wrongs.
</li><li><b>Half–hearted forgiveness</b>: Many people practice half–hearted forgiveness, where they let go but continue to ponder and hold onto the grievances. This is akin to picking at a scab, preventing true healing and further toxifying the relationship.
</li><li><b>Letting go and forgetting</b>: The key components of true forgiveness are to let go of the hurt and actively forget the incident. This means not dwelling on the past, which only persists because of continued attention to the wrongdoing.
</li><li><b>Self–righteous forgiveness</b>: A form of half–hearted forgiveness where the forgiver holds a sense of moral superiority, often keeping a mental scorecard against the offender. This attitude fosters resentment and can create an undercurrent of passive–aggressiveness, undermining the relationship.
</li><li><b>Conscious decision of forgiveness</b>: Forgiveness should be a deliberate choice, not an obligation. If a relationship is deemed repairable and the person at fault is truly remorseful, a conscious decision to forgive can be made, signifying a new start.
</li><li><b>Inner strength in forgiveness</b>: Forgiveness demands inner strength and courage, as it involves making a personal promise not to revisit the painful memories. It requires the resolve to say "no" when such thoughts resurface.
</li><li><b>Toxic forgiveness</b>: A state of forgiveness in name only, where angst and negative rumination continue to fester, leading to potentially explosive consequences and a souring of the relationship.
</li><li><b>Deciding to forgive</b>: The decision to forgive is personal and contingent on whether the broken boundary can be mended. There is no obligation to forgive when the boundary has been irreparably crossed.
</li><li><b>Insights from Maxwell Maltz</b>: Echoing ideas from Maltz's book "Psycho–Cybernetics," true forgiveness is reached when there is no longer any reason to harbor hate or judgement toward the offender.
</li><li><b>Harness inner nobility for forgiveness</b>: Becoming more forgiving requires summoning inner qualities like nobility, strength, and courage. These higher values serve as a framework for how one wants future relationships to evolve and whether forgiveness can be utilized as a tool for repairing relationship issues.
</li><li><b>Letting go and future orientation</b>: Leo emphasizes that difficulties in forgiveness are due to being stuck in the past. He advocates for a future–oriented mindset filled with big plans, life purposes, and ambitions. This shift in focus helps to minimize dwelling on past grievances and promotes letting go.
</li><li><b>Life's forward momentum and forgiveness</b>: When one has a direction and is active in pursuing personal goals and a life mission, petty resentments and grudges tend to diminish. Busy and motivated people don't stagnate mentally, reducing the tendency to ruminate on negative experiences.
</li><li><b>Develop a personal life mission</b>: Leo suggests that developing a sense of purpose and mission in life is essential to let go of past wrongs. Engaging actively with life goals redirects the mind away from petty thoughts and focuses on creativity and positive contributions.
</li><li><b>Decision to forgive</b>: The final recommendation is to be decisive about forgiveness, to commit fully to forgiving someone, and not to dwell on it any longer. Leo encourages his audience to make a decision now and stick to it as a part of the solution for living a forgiving life.
</li><li><b>Self–improvement and life success</b>: Leo concludes by motivating his viewers to learn about themselves and apply different strategies for growth. Improving oneself can enhance all life aspects, including understanding the core principles of living successfully and happily.
