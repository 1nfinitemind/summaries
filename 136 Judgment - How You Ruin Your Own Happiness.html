            <ul>
<li><strong>Understanding of Judgment</strong> : Judgment involves the mind creating arbitrary divisions within an undivided reality, categorizing things, people, situations, and self as good or bad based on personal likes and dislikes. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment and Survival</strong> : Judgment stems from the mind's survival instinct, constantly evaluating things for their utility in survival and reproduction, leading to a labelling system based on perceived usefulness or lack thereof. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception of Good and Bad</strong> : Leo explains that good and bad are not inherent in reality; they are neutral. The mind labels them as such, which leads to a relentless pursuit of what's perceived as better, resulting in an unfulfilling cycle of endless action. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Being Judgmental</strong> : Being overly judgmental leads to misery, dissatisfaction, and a toxic internal state that can negatively influence relationships and attract similarly negative individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Reduction of Judgment</strong> : The ideal approach to life is to see reality as it is, without the labels created by the mind. Reducing judgment leads to a more peaceful existence, and this requires mindful effort and mental retraining. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Actualization and Non-Judgment</strong> : Self-actualized individuals do not judge their reality constantly; they see things without a selfish valuation mindset and exist in harmony with the neutrality of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment in Daily Interactions</strong> : Leo discusses how we often engage with objects, people, and situations from a self-centered perspective of "what's in it for me." He portrays this attitude as dysfunctional, highlighting that it leads to dissatisfaction since things may not always meet our expectations or desires. </li>
<li><strong>Consequence of Implementing Utility</strong> : He observes that treating objects or individuals purely as a means to fulfill personal needs without appreciating them wholly can rob us of deeper pleasure and contentment in life. </li>
<li><strong>Practice of Presence</strong> : Leo suggests that there is a profound pleasure in being present with an object or situation without expecting anything from it. He advises taking a moment to just "be with it," recommending this as a pathway to greater happiness and self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Micro vs. Macro Judgments</strong> : He reinforces the distinction between obvious ‘macro&#39; judgments and subtle ‘micro&#39; judgments made almost every second, often subconsciously, such as critiquing the size of a plate while cooking or wishing for lemons while looking in the fridge. </li>
<li><strong>Nature's Lesson in Non-Judgment</strong> : Leo provides an example of feeling at one with reality during a sunset, stating that the lack of judgment, not the scene's beauty, is what brings true fulfillment and peace. </li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness as a Tool for Awareness</strong> : He prescribes an exercise of mindfulness, just observing one's judgments without trying to stop them, to understand their artificial nature and impact on daily experience. </li>
<li><strong>Encouragement to Subscribe</strong> : Leo wraps up by emphasizing the importance of consistent personal development and invites viewers to subscribe to his newsletter on Actualized.org for updates on self-actualization techniques, promising that regular engagement with such material can lead to an extraordinary level of happiness and success.</li>
