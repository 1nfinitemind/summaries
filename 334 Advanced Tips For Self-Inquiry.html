        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Y23xkd2kqlo' target='_blank'>Advanced Tips For Self-Inquiry</a></h1>
        <p><em>"There is no path, but only a fool doesn't walk it." - Unknown</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-inquiry for those feeling stuck</strong> : Leo provides guidance specifically for individuals who are already practicing self-inquiry but feel frustrated and confused. He acknowledges the difficulty of the process and aims to offer helpful tips to prevent wasted time chasing false expectations. </li>
<li><strong>Fundamental misconception about the goal of self-inquiry</strong> : The initial tip from Leo is a reminder that what someone practicing self-inquiry is looking for is formlessness, not a mystical experience or a tangible object. He stresses the importance of detaching from all forms and mentions the paradox of looking for a needle in a haystack when the needle represents 'no needle.' </li>
<li><strong>Looking inward for answers</strong> : Leo advises against seeking enlightenment from external sources, such as other individuals or spiritual texts. He emphasizes that the true nature of what one is seeking cannot be verbally or conceptually described and must be discovered personally through dedicated practice. </li>
<li><strong>Constant reminders during self-inquiry</strong> : Leo underlines the need for practitioners to remind themselves that all ideas and perceptions are not the ultimate goal. The mind's compulsion to conceptualize must be resisted, as true enlightenment cannot be symbolized or mentally imaged. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and embracing the present</strong> : The crucial aspect of self-inquiry involves accepting that 'nothing is hidden' and 'nothing is elsewhere,' implying that the present moment is where one will find the essence of enlightenment, not in some elusive, mystical state. </li>
<li><strong>Existence as enlightenment</strong> : Leo identifies existence itself as enlightenment, stressing the importance of becoming fully conscious of the present moment as it is, which he describes as 'absolute infinity.' </li>
<li><strong>Using different questions in self-inquiry</strong> : He recommends experimenting with various self-inquiry questions to find which resonate the most, noting that while they may differ, they all converge on the same point of becoming present to the current moment. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of Enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment means realizing that what we think we are&mdash;the body and the mind&mdash;are actually illusions. Instead of identifying with these constructs, enlightenment involves awakening from the dream-like nature of reality, which is fundamentally no different from a dream we might have at night. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of Disidentification</strong> : The statement that "you are not the body and you are not the mind" is emphasized as being of utmost significance, possibly the most critical statement one could understand. It challenges the core of what is conventionally believed by society and by oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Literal Immortality</strong> : Leo explains that enlightenment involves coming to the realization of literal immortality. If what he says is true, then everything one has thought about life and existence could be completely incorrect, underlining the profound impact of such a realization. </li>
<li><strong>Work and Dedication to Enlightenment</strong> : Engaging in the self-inquiry process is not meant to be effortless or accidental. It requires intentional and serious work, which can involve thousands of hours of dedicated practice&mdash;a commitment that Leo argues is worth it in pursuit of something as significant as enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Shift in Expectations and Motivation</strong> : If one truly grasps the magnitude of enlightenment, their approach to self-inquiry changes fundamentally. Questions like "when will I become enlightened?" become superfluous; what remains is a relentless pursuit regardless of time required, driven by the understanding of enlightenment's significance. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging Identity</strong> : A key tip in the practice of self-inquiry is to challenge one's identity, questioning how we come to identify with our body, feelings, thoughts, and the processes of identifying something as a distinct entity in the first place. </li>
<li><strong>Precision in Self-Inquiry</strong> : Leo advises practitioners to be specific and precise when questioning identifications during self-inquiry. By drilling down on actual sensations, thoughts, or feelings present in the moment and questioning if they truly constitute one's identity, false identifications can be exposed. </li>
<li><strong>Existence Without Identification</strong> : One should contemplate the nature of their existence without attaching to any sensations, thoughts, or mental images. By challenging the very concept of identity, the aim is to unravel the mind's tendency to 'fudge the numbers' and reach a clearer understanding of one's true self beyond conventional labels. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging Personal Identifications Systematically</strong> : Leo insists on a systematic self-inquiry process, where one must critically examine every aspect of their identity. Skipping steps or attempting to shortcut the process by declaring oneself as 'nothing' can hinder progress, as deep-rooted beliefs might remain unchallenged. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Level of Self-Inquiry</strong> : Self-inquiry should be so profound that it calls into question the physical fabric of reality itself. It requires such seriousness and gravity that the possibility of one's body or the very floor beneath them ceasing to exist must be entertained. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysical Implications of True Self-Inquiry</strong> : Leo explains that genuine self-inquiry is not merely philosophical but dissolves the physical fabric of space and time, challenging the very core of one's existence on a metaphysical level. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding 'Nothing' in Enlightenment</strong> : Leo clarifies that the term 'nothing' in non-dual teachings is not the absence of everything but rather is everything or absolute existence. Misunderstanding this can lead to incorrectly applying the concept and potentially hindering self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Focus on Actuality During Self-Inquiry</strong> : The importance of focusing on actuality&mdash;what is present and concrete in the moment&mdash;is emphasized. The exercise of separating actuality from past, future, or theoretical concepts is central to the self-inquiry process. </li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Content from Existence</strong> : Leo advises practitioners to differentiate between the content of consciousness (forms and objects) and existence itself, akin to distinguishing the images on a TV screen from the screen itself. He urges individuals to shift focus to the fact of existence, which can be slippery but is fundamental to self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as the Constant Across Life</strong> : Enlightenment is presented as the one constant across all moments of life. Leo encourages practitioners to discard any beliefs or experiences that fluctuate with time, as true enlightenment is an unchanging, ever-present element. </li>
<li><strong>Existence Before and Beyond Physical Life</strong> : Leo discusses the significance of a constant element that exists independently of one's birth or death, suggesting that it is this constant existence that should be the focus of self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Principle of Change and Impermanence</strong> : He demonstrates the impermanence of perceptions and objects to convey that they cannot represent the true self, and what is eternal and existed before one's birth is what should be sought after in self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Shift from 'Figuring Out' to Observation</strong> : Leo urges a shift from attempting to intellectually solve the puzzle of enlightenment to practicing pure observation, trusting that insights will develop over time. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Understanding vs. Thinking</strong> : Distinguishing between an intuitive understanding of consciousness and conceptual thinking is essential, with Leo suggesting psychedelics as potential tools to grasp different degrees of consciousness for those open to such experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Ineffectiveness of trying to 'figure it out'</strong> : Leo urges moving from a mindset of trying to 'figure it out' in self-inquiry to one of pure observation. Figuring it out involves mental modeling, whereas observation is about directly witnessing existence without interference. </li>
<li><strong>Transition from analysis to observation in self-inquiry</strong> : With time, the tendency to analyze during self-inquiry diminishes, and individuals naturally transition to observing. Initially, one may gain some conceptual clarity through analysis but not enlightenment; effective insight arises from patient observation of existence or awareness itself. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of patience in observation</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of patience and trust in the power of pure observation for effective self-inquiry. He suggests that when continuous observation is applied over time, it erodes misguided conceptions and reveals enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding consciousness beyond thought</strong> : Leo invites viewers to differentiate between thinking about consciousness and directly experiencing consciousness. To illustrate the difference, he recommends taking psychedelics or practicing simple awareness of one's own existence. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging the naive realist paradigm</strong> : Leo encourages questioning the naive assumption of a physical reality as described by modern physics. Reality, he explains, is more akin to a collection of hallucinations or dreams, with no true substance behind them. </li>
<li><strong>Non-physicality of reality in self-inquiry</strong> : Reinforcing the hallucinatory nature of reality, Leo suggests replacing the physical conception of reality with the perspective of dreams or hallucinations, pointing to the non-existence of an underlying physical infrastructure. </li>
<li><strong>No guaranteed process towards enlightenment</strong> : Leo asserts that enlightenment isn't achieved through a set technique or process; rather, it's a "fortunate accident," albeit with odds that can be increased through self-inquiry, akin to increasing the chance of being struck by lightning. </li>
<li><strong>Complementarity of 'no self' and 'true self' teachings</strong> : Clarifying apparent contradictions in enlightenment teachings, Leo explains that 'no self' and 'true self' are two perspectives of the same truth and can be used flexibly, depending on individual needs and attachments. </li>
<li><strong>Existence of multiple paths to enlightenment</strong> : Leo stresses the existence of various valid self-inquiry paths and cautions against wasting time criticizing other paths or making comparisons. He advises focusing on personal growth and discovery. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding mechanical meditation practices</strong> : Leo advises against mindless, mechanical practices of meditation, emphasizing the point of meditation is to enhance awareness actively, not superficially following techniques or postures. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity for prolonged focused sessions in self-inquiry</strong> : To make substantial progress, Leo suggests incorporating regular extended retreats or sessions of meditation and self-inquiry beyond the daily routine to deepen the practice. </li>
<li><strong>Value of extended self-inquiry sessions</strong> : Consistent long hours in meditation or self-inquiry, like 12-hour days or 10-day retreats, are essential as they build momentum, sharpen focus, and lead to significant breakthroughs, far more effectively than shorter daily sessions. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and terror as indicators of progress</strong> : Experiencing rapid heartbeats or feelings akin to dying during self-inquiry signifies that one is nearing enlightenment, and it's crucial to push through this terror to break through to enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Duration and permanence of enlightenment</strong> : Glimpses of mystical insight are not the same as constant enlightenment. True enlightenment does not fade with daily challenges but is a persistent state that transcends life and death. </li>
<li><strong>The deceptive nature of initial breakthroughs</strong> : It's easy to mistake initial experiences or partial realizations for full enlightenment. Enlightenments have many depths, and the work toward deeper understanding should continue relentlessly. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite depth of enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment is an infinitely deep pursuit, requiring continuous work even after profound experiences, to reach the deepest understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness with labeling to aid self-inquiry</strong> : Practicing mindfulness with labeling technique strengthens the ability to observe and aids self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Vigilance against distractions</strong> : As one progresses in self-inquiry, distractions increase. It's vital to remain committed and quickly return to the path if distracted, understanding that these are defense mechanisms of the ego. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as insightful tools</strong> : While not mandatory, psychedelics can offer a quick glimpse into the state that self-inquiry strives for, helping to direct and accelerate the process. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance of emotional labor</strong> : Frustration and confusion are commonplace in the path towards enlightenment, and it is important to embrace emotional labor as part of the journey. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate reward of reality</strong> : Despite the significant investment of time and effort, achieving enlightenment is considered the ultimate reward, granting one the entirety of reality and the answers to life's profound questions.</li>
