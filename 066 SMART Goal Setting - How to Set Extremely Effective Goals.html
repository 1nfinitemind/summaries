            <ul>
    <li><b>SMART Goals Framework</b>: The SMART acronym is a model that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely. This framework acts as a checklist for setting effective goals and is popular across professional and personal development spheres.
</li><li><b>Importance of Goal Specificity</b>: Leo highlights the critical nature of specificity in goals. He argues that vague desires, such as wanting to improve one's wardrobe, don't constitute real goals. Instead, successful goals need exhaustive detail like exact locations for housing or clear job role descriptions.
</li><li><b>The concept of Measurability in Goals</b>: A goal must have clear metrics or indicators to be considered reached. For example, living in a specific high–rise address in San Diego can be a measurable indicator for the goal of moving to a new city.
</li><li><b>Attainability of Goals</b>: Leo advises that goals must align with one's skills, strengths, and interests to be attainable. Unrealistic goals, such as flying to the moon for an average person, don't align well with individual capabilities and desires.
</li><li><b>Realism in Goal Setting</b>: Leo discusses the necessity of setting goals that are achievable given one's current skill set, within a realistic timeframe and with a feasible action plan, as opposed to unrealistic expectations like making a million dollars in a month.
</li><li><b>Timeliness in Goals</b>: Assigning specific timeframes to goals is crucial for success. Leo advocates for setting deadlines down to the year, month, week, or even the day to increase specificity and accountability.
</li><li><b>Leo's Improved Goal–Setting Approach</b>: Leo suggests that instead of strictly adhering to the SMART criteria, goals should be immensely inspiring and large while aligning with personal values and feelings. Enthusiasm generated from big goals can lead to greater motivation and success.
</li><li><b>Goal Visualization as a Daily Practice</b>: Leo adheres to a personal rule that a goal isn't truly set unless it's reviewed and visualized daily until it's achieved. Writing goals down and reflecting on them regularly transforms them from mere desires to active ambitions.
</li><li><b>Align Goals with Personal Values</b>: Goals should be set based on genuine personal desires rather than societal expectations. For instance, one should organize their work to support their value of family time instead of setting misaligned goals of just earning more money.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for Community Engagement</b>: Leo invites viewers to share their goals and accomplishments, fostering a community of growth and accountability, and also suggests signing up at actualized.org for in–depth goal–setting techniques and resources.
