            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/JkoDlg3zy7E' target='_blank'>What Is Art - Understanding The Essence Of Art</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Relative Nature of Art</b>: Art is entirely relative, with no objective standards for what constitutes beauty or art. This relativity is influenced by factors like physiology, psychology, environment, education, culture, and species. Different eras and cultures have their own standards of beauty, which are subject to continuous evolution.
</li><li><b>Human Projection of Meaning in Art</b>: Humans attach meaning and significance to parts of reality, deeming some as beautiful and others not. This process is actually a form of projection, using our complex brain to attribute these qualities to reality.
</li><li><b>Art as a Projection of Consciousness</b>: Instead of viewing art as a mere human construction, Leo suggests looking at art as a consciousness of the innate creativity and beauty in all reality. Our level of consciousness dictates the amount of reality we perceive as artistic or beautiful.
</li><li><b>Art and Appreciation of Life's Cycle</b>: Ordinary and mundane aspects of reality, such as a dead bird, can evoke a range of emotions based on an individual's level of consciousness. For a more conscious person, this could symbolize the cycle of life and death, eliciting beauty and meaning from what many would dismiss.
</li><li><b>Personal Preferences and the Beauty in Art</b>: People's perceptions of what constitutes art or beauty are heavily influenced by personal preferences, which are shaped by myriad factors from biology to cultural upbringing.
</li><li><b>Art's Purpose as Delight in Infinite Creation</b>: The primary aim of art is to take pleasure in the act of infinite creation. The beauty of reality is so vast that our minds must narrow focus on practical matters for survival, thus art serves to expand appreciation for beauty beyond these constraints.
</li><li><b>Highlighting Reality Facets Through Art</b>: Art functions by accentuating specific parts of reality that resonate emotionally with individuals. Personal preferences lead to a diversity of art mediums, as different aspects of reality evoke awe and emotional responses for different people.
</li><li><b>Art as Reality's Highlight</b>: Leo describes art as a process of selecting aspects of reality that move the artist emotionally, and then amplifying those elements for both personal enjoyment and sharing with others. By highlighting these facets, the artist puts them "on a pedestal," allowing others to appreciate them.
</li><li><b>Artistic Process of Selecting and Highlighting</b>: The process of creating art ranges from simple acts, like placing a flower in a vase, to complex ones, like painting an animal to underscore its particular traits. Artists choose features of subjects that fascinate them, such as a lion's ferocity, and translate these qualities into their medium, often requiring technical skills and abstraction.
</li><li><b>Art as Participation in Infinite Creation</b>: Leo equates creating art to playing God, engaging in the eternal and infinite act of creation that is reality itself. This process is not random but is guided by a subtle, intelligent, and ongoing force of evolution, creating new forms from formlessness.
</li><li><b>Evolution Beyond Genetics</b>: Evolution, according to Leo, is not limited to genetic mutation but encompasses everything from star systems to personal growth. It is propelled by a creative force that continuously generates new forms through spontaneous insights, contrasting the common scientific view of randomness.
</li><li><b>Art and Universal Intelligence</b>: Artistic creation taps into universal intelligence, a vast, interconnected force that underlies all existence. This perception is not commonly recognized in scientific fields and requires a broader consciousness to grasp.
</li><li><b>Mystical Experiences and the Nature of Reality</b>: Leo suggests that mystical experiences reveal the nature of reality as an intelligent void from which the universe arises. This perspective reveals that human intelligence is just a tiny part of a larger, universal intelligence that governs the ongoing creative process.
</li><li><b>The Role of Maya in Creativity</b>: By engaging in the creative process, artists participate in Maya, the illusion of reality described in Hindu philosophy, which is intrinsically creative and spawns endless layers of illusions within illusions.
</li><li><b>Highlighting Beauty Through Art</b>: Art's role is to highlight beauty, making it more apparent to those with lower levels of consciousness. It serves to raise awareness by invoking emotional responses, which are key to waking people up and expanding their consciousness beyond pragmatic concerns.
</li><li><b>The Contrast between Survival and Appreciation of Beauty</b>: Leo discusses how day–to–day survival concerns can distract individuals from the enjoyment of beauty, which is considered a luxury and not practically useful. Art, by invoking emotions such as joy and awe, can re–engage people with the beauty of existence.
</li><li><b>Art's Role in Shaking Consciousness</b>: Art aims to awaken humanity from a state of survival mode, which makes society resemble an ant colony or robots. By elevating pieces of beauty for people to appreciate, art allows individuals to remember and recognize the beauty in all things and ultimately reach a new level of human existence.
</li><li><b>Magnifying the Beauty in the Mundane</b>: Through artistic expression, people can begin to appreciate the beauty present in the most minute details of life, even in the cracks of kitchen tiles. Art helps draw attention to the infinite beauty that exists at every magnification level, enhancing consciousness and appreciation of our complex reality.
</li><li><b>Art–Making Process as Spiritual and Emotional Engagement</b>: The artist must engage deeply with their environment, be inspired by the beauty around them, and emotionally connect with their observations. Making art is not merely pragmatic but involves spontaneous creativity, akin to spiritual practices, leading to the cultivation of original works that resonate with both the artist and audience.
</li><li><b>Sharing Beauty as a Human Instinct and Drive</b>: Humans naturally desire to share profound experiences, mirroring how artists and mystics aspire to disseminate their spiritual realizations. Creating and sharing beauty is integral to cultural development and personal fulfillment, guiding individuals toward finding their life's purpose.
</li><li><b>Role of Art Viewers</b>: Viewers of art play a crucial role by giving purpose to the artist's work and experiencing spiritual enrichment themselves. Consuming art can provide an accessible spiritual connection for those overwhelmed by daily life, potentially inspiring them to explore their artistic abilities and enhancing societal consciousness.
</li><li><b>Art's Impact on Elevating Society</b>: Art serves as a medium for fostering empathy and broadening perspectives. Through stories and experiences portrayed in art, viewers are moved emotionally and intellectually, leading to a more compassionate, understanding, and humane society.
</li><li><b>The Dilemma of Artist Recognition and Approval</b>: As artists seek recognition and approval for their work, they may become entangled in neuroses and lose sight of the initial spiritual connection that drew them to art. This pursuit of validation can hinder the creative spirit and cause emotional distress.
</li><li><b>Art's Medium Shaped by Culture and Marketplace</b>: While art has no intrinsic medium limitations, practical success for artists often depends on cultural norms and the marketplace. Artists face the challenge of shaping culture with their work without allowing it to dictate their creative expression.
</li><li><b>Artists versus Mainstream Culture</b>: Artists should rise above mainstream culture, which often has a low consciousness quality, and instead elevate culture by infusing it with their higher consciousness rather than seeking approval and being shaped by it.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Radical Art</b>: Cutting–edge artists may face rejection or demonization by mainstream society due to cultural resistance against anything that threatens established norms or presents new perspectives.
</li><li><b>Obscurity of Genius–Level Artists</b>: Many artists worldwide produce exceptional, innovative work but go unrecognized because their art does not align with current cultural acceptance or market demands.
</li><li><b>Balancing Artistic Integrity with Economics</b>: Artists must navigate the tension between staying true to their creative vision and the practicalities of marketing their art to support themselves financially.
</li><li><b>Success and Spiritual Connection in Art</b>: Achieving commercial success in art poses a risk of losing spiritual connection, as the pursuit of further success might lead to sacrificing the fulfillment that comes from the creative process.
</li><li><b>Importance of Deepening Spiritual Connection</b>: Artists should focus on deepening their spiritual connection to continually evolve their art through enhanced creativity, perceiving and integrating beauty from around them and within.
</li><li><b>Personal Development for Artists</b>: Reducing ego and committing to personal development and consciousness work is crucial for artists to become purer vehicles for the innate creative force and produce high–quality art.
</li><li><b>Business Acumen and Marketing in Art</b>: Artists need to understand business, marketing, and mass psychology to reach broader audiences effectively while also engaging in personal development to avoid neuroticism.
</li><li><b>Art as Therapy and Personal Development</b>: Artists often use their art as a form of therapy, but lasting fulfillment and improvement in their craft require addressing foundational issues through serious personal development work.
</li><li><b>Vision for an Effortless and Joyful Artistic Process</b>: Artists should envision and strive towards an effortless and joyful creative process that involves constant learning, enjoying their work, and sharing beauty with the world.
</li><li><b>Personal Enjoyment and Appreciation of Beauty</b>: Personal development work enhances not only the artistic process but also one's overall ability to appreciate the beauty in reality, benefiting even those who are not artists.
