            <ul>
    <li><b>Moth and Lamp Metaphor</b>: Leo uses the visual of moths trying to reach a lamp through a window to depict the spiritual quest for enlightenment. He equates the futile bashing of the moths against the window to seekers' attempts to reach enlightenment through self–inquiry, emphasizing that most fail due to not understanding the process.
</li><li><b>Limitations of the Mind</b>: Leo discusses the inevitable encounter with the mental barrier that prevents understanding one's true self, pure awareness. Self–inquiry leads to this impasse, showing that the mind's tools–thought, reasoning, and experience–are insufficient to grasp what is beyond experience.
</li><li><b>Leap to Enlightenment</b>: He suggests that enlightenment requires a sudden, magical leap rather than effortful techniques or willpower. The realization is akin to teleporting inside, where pure awareness resides, implying that such an event is unpredictable and cannot be forced.
</li><li><b>Unexpected Nature of Realization</b>: Leo cautions against misinterpreting the precept of 'being the light already' as a harbinger that everyone is already enlightened. He clarifies that true enlightenment comes from an internal realization, which is uncommon.
</li><li><b>Value of Persistence and Humility</b>: He notes that while self–inquiry seems futile, similar to the moths' behavior, the act of persisting and experiencing the futility is essential. The journey is humbling, as it confronts seekers with their ignorance and helplessness, and only those who endure may eventually 'teleport' to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Continued Dedication</b>: Leo advocates for steadfast commitment to self–inquiry, even when faced with the desire to quit. He instills trust in the process, suggesting that those who maintain their effort toward enlightenment will, in due time, experience the necessary discontinuous jump.
