            <ul>
    <li><b>Synopsis of self–esteem in women</b>: Leo breaks down self–esteem into two components: self–efficacy (the ability to control and direct one's life) and self–respect (inherent value and the right to happiness). He observes that women generally have more self–esteem issues than men, which can result in dysfunctional relationships and feelings of codependency.
</li><li><b>Cultural influences on self–esteem</b>: Culturally, boys are encouraged to be competitive and assertive, while girls are often directed towards nurturing roles focused on relationships and family. This disparity can lead to differences in self–efficacy development between genders.
</li><li><b>Masculine energy and learning</b>: Leo describes masculine energy as competitive and aggressive, which forces men to face challenges and resistance, leading to rapid learning and a strong sense of self–efficacy.
</li><li><b>Impact of passive roles on women</b>: Women often playing supportive roles or as the secondary partner can suffer from a decline in self–efficacy, similar to muscle atrophy from a lack of use. This lack of active engagement in challenging situations can result in feelings of victimhood.
</li><li><b>Physiological tendencies</b>: Besides cultural conditioning, Leo acknowledges biological differences that make competition more natural for men and submissiveness more natural for women. While these feminine qualities are valuable, they can also lead to disadvantages such as a lack of control and tolerance for adverse situations.
</li><li><b>Striving for active femininity</b>: Leo advocates for women to maintain their femininity while also actively challenging themselves in ways that feel natural to them. This balance can help build self–efficacy while avoiding becoming passive or feeling powerless.
</li><li><b>Self–actualization for women</b>: Leo stresses that self–actualization is not gender–specific and that women should pursue growth by consistently challenging their comfort zones. He highlights that women's higher values may differ from men's, but the pursuit of self–actualization remains key.
</li><li><b>Leo's objective with Actualized.org</b>: Leo promotes his website as a resource for viewers to understand themselves and life better. He offers weekly videos and newsletters aimed at helping viewers grow, achieve their goals, and gradually improve their lives, relating to relationships, business, or health.
