            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/sherlock-holmes-brain' target='_blank'>Sherlock Holmes' Brain</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Consciousness affecting consciousness</strong> : Leo explains that just as atoms influence each other, consciousness can also affect consciousness. The brain, seen as a structure of atoms by materialists, is actually a construct made by consciousness, hence consciousness is influencing itself.</li>
<li><strong>Sherlock Holmes analogy for consciousness</strong> : Leo uses Sherlock Holmes as a metaphor for explaining consciousness and the brain. In Holmes' fictional universe, his brain is real and crucial for his detective work. However, if he realized his reality was authored by Conan Doyle, it would be clear his brain is part of that fiction and not the true cause of his reality.</li>
<li><strong>The true cause of reality</strong> : The true cause of Sherlock Holmes' world, including his brain and the notion that a brain is needed for life, is actually Arthur Conan Doyle, the author outside the fictional frame. Similarly, our reality, including the brain, can be seen as created by an external author, which in this case is consciousness itself.</li>
<li><strong>Awakening beyond the materialist view</strong> : While materialists view reality as atoms and physical objects within a two-dimensional plane, awakening involves recognizing a third orthogonal dimension outside that plane, discovering that material reality is just one aspect within a larger consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring reality and the brain's role</strong> : Our minds need anchors to make the ever-present moment understandable and tangible. The brain, Earth, universe, and the timeline of history serve as these anchors, constructing our perceived reality and are grounded in what we consider normal, consistent with sanity within human society.</li>
<li><strong>Groundlessness and the nature of infinity</strong> : When contemplating the origin of reality, one finds an endless chain leading back to an apparently groundless existence. This infinite regress hints at the true nature of infinity, beyond the comprehension of materialistic and scientific explanations. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as interconnected and interwoven</strong> : Our sense of a solid reality is formed through interconnected anchors that explain our existence. This deep tapestry woven by various explanations such as sitting on Earth, being in the 21st century, and even evolution, creates a compelling but ultimately constructed reality that science contributes to but cannot fully explain. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific explanations as grounding anchors</strong> : The anchors of reality are further reinforced by science, which frames and grounds our sense of reality within the context of atoms, evolution, and history. However, science does not have answers for the origin of life or the universe, ultimately, those answers lie beyond the frame of our constructed reality.</li>
<li><strong>Endless causal questioning</strong> : When materialists speculate on origins, they trace back through atoms, stars, and the Big Bang, but stop at the limits of known science, labeling the unknown as simply unreachable and not to be arrogantly questioned.</li>
<li><strong>Brain and reality misconceptions</strong> : Materialists firmly believe that the brain produces consciousness and cite EEG brainwave correlations as evidence, yet they are caught in a two-dimensional view of reality and are unable to consider the existence of an orthogonal dimension where consciousness is primary.</li>
<li><strong>Sherlock Holmes analogy extended</strong> : Sherlock Holmes, believing he is living in a tangible reality, would discount any idea of being a mere character as insanity. Introducing the truth about his fictional nature would be met with disbelief and would challenge his entire perception of existence.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating transcendence</strong> : Convincing Sherlock Holmes (or anyone) of the possibility of an existence beyond their familiar reality frame requires a delicate, imaginative, and methodical approach, overcoming ingrained disbelief and fear of being perceived as insane or delusional.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges in awakening</strong> : Conveying a shift from a materialistic to a consciousness-first perspective to someone deeply ingrained in the former could be extremely complex, as they would likely counter with arguments that adhere strictly to their logical and material understanding of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Sherlock Holmes' receptiveness</strong> : Leo hypothesizes various approaches to help Sherlock Holmes awaken to the truth of his existence, anticipating resistance based on materialistic beliefs and fears of societal judgment. He underscores the importance of seeding the idea of an orthogonal dimension beyond Holmes' current understanding without triggering outright rejection.</li>
<li><strong>Awakening through substance</strong> : Leo suggests a thought experiment where as an author, one could introduce a substance into Holmes' story that temporarily expands his consciousness, allowing him to experience the orthogonal dimension. This intervention would be a narrative device to guide Holmes towards an awakening without depending on his logical acceptance.</li>
<li><strong>The orthogonal dimension</strong> : Recognizing the existence of an orthogonal dimension-a realm beyond our perceivable material reality-is presented as the key to spiritual awakening, which requires a significant paradigm shift. Leo emphasizes that this is not just a philosophical divergence but an experiential transition that reshapes one's understanding of existence.</li>
<li><strong>Causation in fictional realities</strong> : In video games, apparent causation such as a bullet causing death is actually pre-determined by code written by the developers. This illustrates how perceived causal relationships within a fictional frame can misrepresent the true origin, which is the authors' imagination, paralleling how in our reality, material causation is a projection from higher-dimensional consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as consciousness</strong> : Leo claims that what appears to be the physical interaction between psychedelics and the brain is actually an encounter of different facets of consciousness. The 'physical' effects of psychedelics are explained as consciousness manifesting experiences within its imagined framework, challenging the assumption that anything is fundamentally physical or material.</li>
<li><strong>Orthogonal awakening as God realization</strong> : The deep, orthogonal awakening allows one to discover one's true nature as the infinite consciousness or God. This realization is tantamount to God recognizing itself in the narrative it has authored, similarly to Sherlock Holmes recognizing he is both the character and the writer, Arthur Conan Doyle. Understanding God as the label for this ultimate, boundless reality underlines that the journey to this realization is not merely philosophical but a profound experiential shift beyond the narrative of material existence.</li>
<li><strong>Orthogonal dimension to reality</strong> : Most people cannot conceive of an orthogonal dimension beyond the material world they know, but recognizing this possibility can be transformative. This shift allows one to pursue spiritual practices and possibly experience awakenings that offer glimpses into a reality beyond conventional philosophy and materialism.</li>
<li><strong>Communication of higher consciousness</strong> : Explaining the concept of higher-dimensional reality is challenging, requiring "skillful means" to bridge the communication gap between those who have and have not experienced it. Different spiritual approaches, beliefs, and practices reflect varied attempts to guide individuals through the discovery of this orthogonal direction.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping three-dimensional experiences on a two-dimensional plane</strong> : Like trying to represent a globe on a flat map, discussing higher-dimensional experiences within the limitations of language and two-dimensional thinking is inherently distorted. The process becomes even more complex when addressing fundamental constructs like matter, space, time, and causality, which all transform when viewed from the orthogonal perspective.</li>
<li><strong>God as the infinite mind</strong> : The individual comes to recognize themselves as God, an eternal consciousness imagining infinite backstories for all existence. This realization manifests as God being both the author and the character within the narrative of reality, underscoring the unity between the individual self and the God-self, with God being the absolute, infinite source of all creation.</li>
<li><strong>Discovering and experiencing non-duality</strong> : The act of teaching non-duality involves the intricate task of leading others to the realization of God as both creator and creation. This journey can be initiated through various means, including the responsible use of psychedelics, which can momentarily reveal the orthogonal direction that is typically obscured by ordinary perception and materialistic assumptions.</li>
