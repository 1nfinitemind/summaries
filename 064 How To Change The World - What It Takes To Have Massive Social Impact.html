            <ul>
    <li><b>Acknowledging the Desire to Change the World</b>: Leo praises individuals who look beyond their personal issues to consider how they can contribute to the world. He believes the coming century will see a shift towards greater numbers of people seeking to make an impact once their basic needs are met.
</li><li><b>Impact through Visionary Work or Role Modeling</b>: Impacting the world can be achieved through large–scale efforts like starting an innovative company or through everyday interactions that set examples of passion, compassion, and love, influencing the people around us.
</li><li><b>Fulfillment from Contribution</b>: Leo finds personal contribution to be an immensely fulfilling experience. This fulfillment, he suggests, comes from advancing humanity and embodying higher ideals, rather than from purely material success.
</li><li><b>Self–Mastery as a Prerequisite to Change</b>: The inability to master one's thoughts, emotions, and basic life aspects such as finance and health is a major barrier to effecting world change. Leo emphasizes that self–mastery is vital to progress beyond personal struggles.
</li><li><b>Maslow's Hierarchy and World Change</b>: Leo refers to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, connecting the self–actualization stage to the desire to make the world a better place. He indicates that having one's basic needs met is foundational to aspiring to greater societal impacts.
</li><li><b>Long–Term Commitment to Change</b>: Changing the world requires a long–term vision and overcoming immediate self–centered concerns. Sustaining efforts for social change demands personal sacrifices and preparations, including addressing one's habitual distractions and addictions.
</li><li><b>Starting with Personal Growth</b>: Leo advises to begin with self–improvement, advocating for personal development in health, relationships, and financial stability. This robust foundation is akin to building a skyscraper on solid ground, capable of withstanding the pressures of societal change.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Resource for Mastery</b>: Leo concludes by promoting Actualized.org as a resource for individuals dedicated to mastering themselves and thereby better positioned to implement world change, offering exclusive content on psychology and success.
