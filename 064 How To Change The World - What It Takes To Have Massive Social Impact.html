            <ul>
<li><strong>Acknowledging the Desire to Change the World</strong> : Leo praises individuals who look beyond their personal issues to consider how they can contribute to the world. He believes the coming century will see a shift towards greater numbers of people seeking to make an impact once their basic needs are met. </li>
<li><strong>Impact through Visionary Work or Role Modeling</strong> : Impacting the world can be achieved through large-scale efforts like starting an innovative company or through everyday interactions that set examples of passion, compassion, and love, influencing the people around us. </li>
<li><strong>Fulfillment from Contribution</strong> : Leo finds personal contribution to be an immensely fulfilling experience. This fulfillment, he suggests, comes from advancing humanity and embodying higher ideals, rather than from purely material success. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Mastery as a Prerequisite to Change</strong> : The inability to master one's thoughts, emotions, and basic life aspects such as finance and health is a major barrier to effecting world change. Leo emphasizes that self-mastery is vital to progress beyond personal struggles. </li>
<li><strong>Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy and World Change</strong> : Leo refers to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, connecting the self-actualization stage to the desire to make the world a better place. He indicates that having one&#39;s basic needs met is foundational to aspiring to greater societal impacts. </li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Commitment to Change</strong> : Changing the world requires a long-term vision and overcoming immediate self-centered concerns. Sustaining efforts for social change demands personal sacrifices and preparations, including addressing one's habitual distractions and addictions. </li>
<li><strong>Starting with Personal Growth</strong> : Leo advises to begin with self-improvement, advocating for personal development in health, relationships, and financial stability. This robust foundation is akin to building a skyscraper on solid ground, capable of withstanding the pressures of societal change. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a Resource for Mastery</strong> : Leo concludes by promoting Actualized.org as a resource for individuals dedicated to mastering themselves and thereby better positioned to implement world change, offering exclusive content on psychology and success.</li>
