            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/w4ZWNzSliGk' target='_blank'>The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures - Zen's Stages Of Enlightenment Explained</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Things that smell of Buddhism are disagreeable, but things that have<br />
absolutely no whiff of Buddhism are even worse." - Yamada Mumon</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures</strong> : The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures emerged nearly a thousand years ago in China, evolving into different versions over time with the aim of mapping the stages of spiritual awakening in Zen Buddhism. </li>
<li><strong>Yamada Mamon's Influence</strong> : Leo Gura bases his explanation of the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures on Yamada Mamon's rare book "Lectures on the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures," highlighting it as a source of advanced wisdom initially intended for Zen monk students. </li>
<li><strong>The Map's Role in Spirituality</strong> : The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures serve as a guide through various stages of awakening and are comparable to other spiritual models like Spiral Dynamics, emphasizing growth and evolution beyond a single experience. </li>
<li><strong>Warning of Advanced Teachings</strong> : Before delving into the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures, Leo warns of the model's complexity and the readiness required for individuals to properly grasp and apply its lessons. </li>
<li><strong>First Picture - Searching for the Ox</strong> : The journey starts with individuals feeling lost and attempting to understand life's purpose, leading to the initial desire for awakening and a vow to achieve enlightenment. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rscWqF6B/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ox as an Enlightenment Symbol</strong> : The Ox symbolizes enlightenment, representing ultimate truth and the answers to the purpose of life, nature of suffering, reality, and existence. </li>
<li><strong>Dualistic Viewpoint of Individuals</strong> : Embroiled in discriminative, dualistic thinking, people struggle with confusion caused by continuous comparison and the inability to grasp non-duality. </li>
<li><strong>Starting the Spiritual Journey</strong> : The desire for enlightenment is highlighted as an essential first step on the spiritual path, countering the misconception that seeking awakening is misguided. </li>
<li><strong>Endurance and Suffering on the Spiritual Path</strong> : The spiritual journey is likened to climbing Mount Everest, requiring substantial investment and preparation to avoid rushing into it and potentially giving up. </li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Spiritual Practice</strong> : Leo emphasizes that sporadic practice will not yield results; spiritual techniques like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry must be pursued consistently to achieve progress. </li>
<li><strong>Consistent Effort in Spiritual Work</strong> : Leo Gura discusses the importance of persistent and consistent spiritual practice. Without a strong and singular focus, efforts may be comparable to froth that drifts away in a stream, while pushing ahead single-mindedly ensures progress toward awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Stumbling Upon the Ox's Footprints</strong> : This metaphor describes those who have encountered spiritual concepts and practices superficially, like reading books or experiencing brief moments of insight during meditation or through psychedelics, but have not fully grasped or seen the 'Ox' of true enlightenment. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Mpry1SRB/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-2.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges of Skepticism and Superficial Practices</strong> : Leo warns against the pitfalls of skepticism and casual spiritual practices that prevent deep engagement with the path to awakening. Intellectualization without practice can lead to self-delusion, and the need for genuine commitment to overcome this is emphasized. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Studying and Learning from Scriptures</strong> : Citing a Zen master, Leo underlines the necessity of studying traditional teachings and working with scripture to avoid misdirection, negating the belief that Zen practice excludes scholarly study. </li>
<li><strong>Persistence to Catch the Ox</strong> : The Zen master's advice portrayed by Leo suggests steadfast dedication reaffirms one's vow to attain enlightenment. Calling upon listeners not to abandon efforts because certainty of catching the Ox comes with perseverance and resolve. </li>
<li><strong>The First Glimpse of the Real 'Ox'</strong> : Leo describes the profound experience of the first real sighting of the 'Ox'. This initial mystical experience can be both awe-inspiring and terrifying, creating a more serious commitment to the spiritual path due to the realization of its reality. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QNk1051h/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-3.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the Rarified Nature of Awakening</strong> : Leo communicates the predicament of those who experience just a momentary glimpse of awakening. The magnitude of the experience often results in a retreat back to the ego, highlighting the challenge to stably face and integrate the 'Ox', or enlightenment, into one's life. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Completing the Journey</strong> : The Zen master quoted points out that catching a glimpse of the Ox is only an early stage in the spiritual journey. Even after this first sighting, there are several more stages to go through to fully catch and train the Ox, signifying the continuity and difficulty of the spiritual path. </li>
<li><strong>Communicating Non-Duality</strong> : Claiming words fail to express non-duality, as language is inherently dualistic. Leo Gura explains the difficulty in communicating about the Ox (enlightenment) because any attempt to describe it only further entrenches the dualistic perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Kensho's Vulnerability to Worldly Encounters</strong> : Kensho, or awakening attained through seated meditation, is fragile and can be disrupted by the chaos of the external world. The internal power built through Samadhi (meditative consciousness) is easily disturbed by everyday sensory experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions About Enlightenment</strong> : Many enter the spiritual journey with naive expectations of enlightenment being an endpoint after which no further work is needed. However, Gura asserts the path of awakening is more challenging and life-altering than expected. </li>
<li><strong>Owning and Taming the Ox</strong> : Gura emphasizes the difficulty in truly catching and owning the Ox. Taming the Ox requires the complete surrender of the ego, lifestyle, and societal conditioning to genuinely embody enlightenment. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZqGpDxwK/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-4.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problems with Selfish Spirituality</strong> : Using spirituality for egotistical purposes, such as starting cults or seeking fame, contradicts the essence of enlightenment. The craving and attachment to such desires are antithetical to spiritual awakening and will cause the Ox to flee. </li>
<li><strong>Danger of Twisting Spiritual Experiences</strong> : A warning of the perils when one's ego manipulates an initial awakening experience, potentially leading to starting cults or adopting misaligned motives rather than a true spiritual realization. </li>
<li><strong>The Process of Taming the Ox</strong> : Described as grueling, involving spiritual purification and extensive inner work. It requires constant self-reflection to confront deep-rooted selfishness and desires. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Px1YGv7b/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-5.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinction Between Beginners and Masters</strong> : Gura clarifies that beginners often assume enlightenment marks the end of their spiritual practice, whereas masters continue rigorous post-Satori practice to purify selfishness and ignorance over many years. </li>
<li><strong>How Post-Satori Practice Differs from Initial Awakening</strong> : The importance of post-Satori practice is to continue even after achieving awakening; it is critical for truly integrating this realization into one's being, which requires ongoing effort until death. </li>
<li><strong>Training of No-Mind Consciousness</strong> : Being an essential part of mastery, training towards a no-mind state&mdash;where the mind is clear of thoughts&mdash;is the pinnacle of spiritual practice. This state reflects a deep, abiding awareness and understanding of non-duality. </li>
<li><strong>Abiding Non-Dual Awareness</strong> : Enlightenment reaches fruition as abiding non-dual awareness becomes the constant state of experience, unrestrained by thoughts. It is likened to a continuous state of "no-mind," where one sees divinity and oneness ceaselessly in everyday existence. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Post-Satori Training</strong> : The post-enlightenment phase, or post-Satori training, involves maintaining moment-to-moment mindfulness. It is a process of perfecting the initial awakening (kensho) and is accessible only after one has seen their true nature through Satori. </li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness as Taming the Ox</strong> : Continuous concentration on mindfulness is likened to taming the Ox. It is essential to train oneself to sustain this state of no-mind to prevent reverting to a condition of unreal thoughts or losing touch with Buddha nature. </li>
<li><strong>Embodiment of Awakening</strong> : The stage of "riding the Ox home" symbolizes the embodiment of awakening into daily life. The non-duality discovered through awakening is reintegrated with the duality of ordinary life, leading to a genuine experience of reality. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jfSjRPb/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-6.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Returning to Ordinary Life with Awakening</strong> : One who has truly attained enlightenment does not remain isolated but returns to impermanent worldly life. The ordinary world is transformed and is seen as the true reality infused with the enlightened perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Transcending the Pursuit of Enlightenment</strong> : The phase called "ox transcended" represents ceasing the chase for awakening and acknowledging the present moment as the ultimate enlightenment. Misunderstanding this as mere contentment with the status quo is cautioned against; the significance of this understanding is transformative. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DyxsKTxN/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-7.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misuse of Satori and Remaining Unfettered</strong> : The Zen master warns against being ensnared by one's enlightenment (Satori) experience. True liberation means forgetting about the distinctive attainment and not allowing it to lead to arrogance or a loss of freedom. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as a Means, Not an End</strong> : The metaphor of the Ox, serving as a tool for enlightenment, is discarded once its purpose is served. Enlightenment is about realizing Buddha nature, not clinging to the device that led there. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Life According to Zen</strong> : The ultimate answer to the purpose of life is found in the playful, unconditioned enjoyment of existence. This represents a shift to unconditional happiness, detached from circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Liberation and the Notion of 'No Self'</strong> : True liberation involves the realization of 'no self,' leading to unconditional positivity in life. It signifies a life where happiness is not contingent upon external factors. </li>
<li><strong>Surrender and Liberation</strong> : Surrendering everything including your life, leads to a state where nothing can negatively affect you. In this state, you've faced the worst, voluntarily ending all attachments, and every moment afterward is experienced as a bonus&mdash;a form of liberation and play. </li>
<li><strong>Counterintuitive Happiness</strong> : Leo Gura speaks about the counterintuitive move of choosing happiness under all conditions, abandoning the insistence on conditional happiness which causes suffering. True happiness persists regardless of external events, even in the face of global or personal catastrophes. </li>
<li><strong>Judgments and Original Nature</strong> : Surrendering judgments of good and bad reveals our 'original face' or Buddha nature. Letting go of such dualistic distinctions paradoxically transforms everything into goodness&mdash;a state of non-judgment where all of reality is perceived positively. </li>
<li><strong>Advanced Stages of Human Development</strong> : Attaining a state where no conditions can make one unhappy represents an advanced level of human consciousness, comparable to the dedication required to become a brain surgeon. This stage requires thousands of hours of work, beyond casual spiritual experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation Through Radical Surrender</strong> : True transformation and the ability to experience everything as inherently good requires the complete surrender of one's life (metaphorically and literally) and deeply held personal desires, leading to the highest levels of spiritual development. </li>
<li><strong>Emptiness as the Path to Everythingness</strong> : In the advanced stages of spiritual awakening, all concepts including the self, the ox (enlightenment), and all dualistic efforts, pass away. Here, true emptiness is realized&mdash;it's not experienced as nihilism but as the beginning of an infinite, formless, and unchanging existence. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9FmTSMYT/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-8.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realizing the Non-occurrence of the Universe</strong> : At the peak of spiritual insight, one realizes that nothing in the universe has ever transpired; it's all an illusion or 'pure emptiness'. This radical level of non-duality surpasses ordinary awakening and is described as a complete absence of all conceived reality. </li>
<li><strong>True Emptiness and Revelation of Buddha Nature</strong> : The culmination of practice and discipline is reached where there is no longer an 'awakened', 'awakening', or 'Dharma'. Here, pure Buddha nature is revealed&mdash;standing beyond attributes, judgments, or dualistic distinctions, embodying the perfect 'just so' world of Satori. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of Life and Death's Illusion</strong> : Enlightenment brings the understanding that life and death are not real, and the universe's origin and purpose is acknowledged as non-existent; the familiar world disappears into emptiness. </li>
<li><strong>Emptiness and the Completion of Self's Extinguishing</strong> : Advanced enlightenment leads to a profound emptiness where even the rigorous practices that led to awakening become irrelevant. Any inkling of self or attachment to practices like Mu or Zazen vanishes, leaving one in a state of polished emptiness. </li>
<li><strong>Radical Disidentification from Birth</strong> : At this stage of spirituality, one no longer believes they were ever born, which is a radical departure from conventional self-perception, signifying an absolute disconnection from the narrative of individual existence. </li>
<li><strong>Push to Attain the State of Emptiness</strong> : The master instructs practitioners to strive fervently to experience this ultimate state of being at least once, representing a complete immersion in non-duality and self-annihilation. </li>
<li><strong>The Ninth Picture – Returning to the Source</strong> : Reflecting on 'returning to the source', Leo admits his limited understanding but conveys the stage's message about the superfluous nature of striving since enlightenment exists in the present moment without effort. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7L2T7Tqv/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-9.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges of Embodiment After Deep Mystical Experiences</strong> : Leo acknowledges the difficulty in integrating profound spiritual glimpses from psychedelic experiences into daily life, noting the difference between having deep insights and living them out consistently. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Linear Spiritual Journey</strong> : Leo warns against interpreting spiritual stages linearly, emphasizing personal variations and possible deviations due to different practices or inherent spiritual gifts. </li>
<li><strong>Final Thoughts on Picture Nine</strong> : Returning to the source signifies an absolute identity with the universe and the self, a state where dualistic concerns dissolve, answering all metaphysical inquiries&mdash;the embodiment of Zen where the universe as it is represents heaven. </li>
<li><strong>Humility of Enlightened Individuals</strong> : The tenth stage culminates in re-entering ordinary life with profound humility, completely ordinary to the extent that enlightenment becomes undetectable to others. This humility cannot be feigned and serves as a true indication of mastery. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYhCpgSc/386-The-Ten-Ox-Herding-Pictures-Zen-s-Stages-Of-Enlightenment-Explained-Image-10.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtue of Blending into Ordinary Life After Enlightenment</strong> : Post-enlightenment life involves integrating back into mundane existence while retaining the insight gained. True masters wear their realization without show, living simply and sharing their light in an unassuming manner. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of Enlightenment</strong> : Newcomers to spiritual paths often harbor fantasies of specialness post-enlightenment but fail to recognize that true enlightenment entails the complete loss of self and manifests as unmistakable humility. </li>
<li><strong>Evaluating Spiritual Teachers</strong> : Leo Gura assesses the authenticity of spiritual teachers by observing the depth of their humility, which he considers an honest signal of enlightenment that can't be faked. </li>
<li><strong>Zen Master on Post-Enlightenment Life</strong> : The Zen master's teachings suggest that genuine spiritual masters don't flaunt their enlightenment; instead, they live humbly among ordinary people, shedding any signs of elitism or higher status. </li>
<li><strong>Jesus as a Role Model of Humility</strong> : Jesus is highlighted for his radical humility, living among the common people without showing superiority, serving as a powerful example of the Zen teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Warnings against Elitism Post-Enlightenment</strong> : Spiritual leaders who indulge in luxury and exclusivity may not fully embody the true essence of enlightenment, as true masters are expected to live simple and modest lives. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening Others</strong> : Those who've reached the highest state of awakening have a role to play in helping others realize their Buddha-nature, not through preaching but by simply being present and joyful among them. </li>
<li><strong>The Commitment Necessary for Spiritual Growth</strong> : Understanding the full implications and commitments of the spiritual path can be overwhelming, and were it not for the enticing beginnings, many might abandon the pursuit altogether. </li>
<li><strong>Point of No Return on the Path</strong> : Having learned too much, individuals on the spiritual path reach a point where they can't go back to a state of ignorance. The knowledge they've acquired about existence and suffering compels them to pursue enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Following the Heart on the Spiritual Journey</strong> : Despite uncertainties and potential losses, the spiritual seeker is encouraged to trust the heart and the path it urges them to take, even in the face of deep fears and difficulties. </li>
<li><strong>Enduring the Sufferings of the Spiritual Path</strong> : Enlightenment comes after navigating through increasing levels of suffering, reinforcing the need for perseverance and trust that suffering will eventually cease. </li>
<li><strong>The Role of Wisdom and Guidance</strong> : Leo recommends revisiting wisdom from spiritual masters and texts to stay on track and avoid forming rigid ideologies, thus ensuring one remains true to the path of enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightening Others as a Continuation of Growth</strong> : After attaining enlightenment, the journey continues through the enlightenment of others. This process is framed as an extension and fulfillment of one's spiritual work.</li>
