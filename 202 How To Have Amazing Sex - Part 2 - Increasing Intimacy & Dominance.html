<li><strong>Understanding and Value of Intimacy</strong> : He underscores the unique level of understanding and closeness brought about by intimacy, separating romantic relationships from other forms of relationships. Leo acknowledges that some men may struggle with intimacy due to past experiences and implies the importance of addressing these issues for a deeper connection. </li>
<li><strong>Deep emotional rapport</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of deep emotional rapport from a woman's perspective within an intimate relationship, emphasizing the preference for emotional connections over mere physical or companionate relations. </li>

<li><strong>Fierce eye contact</strong> : He advises using fierce eye contact that communicates certainty and desire, cautioning against appearing hesitant or insecure as it could diminish the perception of dominance. </li>
<li><strong>Growling to signify dominance</strong> : Leo suggests trying out growling, a deep guttural sound, during sex as it can turn on a woman by embodying a manly, animalistic, and dominant nature. </li>
<li><strong>Biting as a dominant act</strong> : Light biting on the neck during kissing is presented as a primal and dominant behavior that can excite many women because of the neck's sensitivity. </li>
<li><strong>Dominant talk in the bedroom</strong> : He describes the use of commanding tonality and authoritative language during sex to assert dominance, emphasizing that words should be commands rather than requests but not abusive. </li>
<li><strong>Rough physical touch for dominance</strong> : Leo details how physical actions such as gripping or binding the partner's arms and holding them down can increase dominance when done safely and consensually. </li>
<li><strong>Safety and consent</strong> : Throughout the discussion on dominance, Leo stresses the importance of making the partner feel safe and ensuring that any dominant behavior is consensual and not dangerous. </li>
<li><strong>Safety and Trust in Dominance</strong> : Leo underscores the necessity of creating a safe environment where the partner trusts the dominant party. Acts must be consensual, and if a partner shows discomfort, one must back off, emphasizing that dominance should never equate to actual mistreatment or forced actions. </li>
<li><strong>Jerking Motions for Physical Dominance</strong> : The use of sudden, jerking motions is explored, such as pulling a partner closer by the hips or neck, or tossing their hands above their head. Leo advises caution to avoid accidental injury and emphasizes the importance of safety while engaging in these dominant acts. </li>

<li><strong>Bedroom Bondage with Neckties</strong> : Leo proposes the use of inexpensive neckties for bedroom bondage, highlighting creative ways to tie a partner to bedposts or using a door to pin their hands above their head. This suggestion is intended to safely explore dominance within the bedroom in a consensual manner. </li>
<li><strong>Dominant Slams into Walls or Doors</strong> : He explains the 'door slam' and 'wall slam' as dominant acts of pressing a partner's body against a firm surface, recommending the use of a door for its softness and noise. Safety and head protection during this action are stressed, along with ensuring the act is consensual. </li>
<li><strong>Spanking, Biting, and Choking</strong> : Leo endorses the exploration of biting, spanking, and choking during sex, particularly in doggy style. He suggests starting gently and promoting clear communication to gauge comfort levels, while being mindful of safety in sensitive areas. </li>

The importance of variety and exploring positions that enhance the sense of dominance is highlighted. </li>

He advises against overthinking or hesitating when wanting to try a new sex position or activity, suggesting that women appreciate confidence in their partner's actions. </li>
