</li><li><b>Safety and Trust in Dominance</b>: Leo underscores the necessity of creating a safe environment where the partner trusts the dominant party. Acts must be consensual, and if a partner shows discomfort, one must back off, emphasizing that dominance should never equate to actual mistreatment or forced actions.
</li><li><b>Jerking Motions for Physical Dominance</b>: The use of sudden, jerking motions is explored, such as pulling a partner closer by the hips or neck, or tossing their hands above their head. Leo advises caution to avoid accidental injury and emphasizes the importance of safety while engaging in these dominant acts.

This suggestion is intended to safely explore dominance within the bedroom in a consensual manner.
</li><li><b>Dominant Slams into Walls or Doors</b>: He explains the 'door slam' and 'wall slam' as dominant acts of pressing a partner's body against a firm surface, recommending the use of a door for its softness and noise. Safety and head protection during this action are stressed, along with ensuring the act is consensual.
