            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/water-fast-ends-carnivore-diet-begins' target='_blank'>Water Fast Ends, Carnivore Diet Begins</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Update on fasting and health</b>: Leo continued his personal story about fasting, describing the persistent hunger and physical weakness he experienced, which led to him prematurely ending his planned two–week fast on the 11th day due to concerns for his health.
</li><li><b>Diverse reactions to fasting</b>: Noting that fasting affects individuals differently, Leo shared that the commonly touted post–fourth–day energy surge did not occur for him, challenging the universal application of such experiences.
</li><li><b>SIBO and fasting disappointment</b>: Despite hopes for fasting to help his Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), Leo found the fast to be largely ineffective, as symptoms quickly returned upon reintroducing food, leading to his decision to try the carnivore diet.
</li><li><b>Lack of spiritual experiences through fasting</b>: Contrary to stories of enlightenment via fasting, Leo's fast lacked any significant spiritual or mystical improvements, causing him to reflect on the Buddha's middle way, which balances the extremes of indulgence and asceticism.
</li><li><b>Health reasons and diet preferences</b>: Despite starting the carnivore diet for SIBO, Leo has reservations about the diet's long–term health effects, its restrictiveness, and has ethical concerns about an all–meat diet. His goal is to shift to a vegan diet when possible.
</li><li><b>Immediate focus on SIBO</b>: Healing SIBO takes precedence over long–term health concerns. The carnivore diet was chosen as a last resort after other options failed to ameliorate his condition.
</li><li><b>Carnivore diet specifics</b>: The diet involves consuming only meat and fat, including steak, chicken, and occasionally fish, avoiding eggs, dairy, and processed foods. Leo uses clarified butter or oils for added fat and cooks simple, protein–focused meals.
</li><li><b>Observations on the carnivore diet</b>: Finds meals boring and satiating, makes eating large quantities challenging. Transitioned to three protein–based meals a day to maintain energy and prevent feelings of cold due to calorie deficit.
</li><li><b>Positive changes from carnivore diet</b>: Within five days, Leo's energy levels improved dramatically, feeling much younger. The diet cleared up chronic sinus congestion and provided insights into his autoimmune condition.
</li><li><b>Autoimmune conditions insights</b>: Discovers that modern diets can be highly toxic, and genetic predispositions may make some people more sensitive to environmental toxins. Food and water are prime suspects for trace toxins contributing to autoimmune issues.
</li><li><b>Individual health and interventions</b>: Stresses the importance of personal health experimentation to find what works, as autoimmune conditions vary greatly in cause and appropriate treatment.
</li><li><b>Die–off symptoms</b>: Around the tenth day of the carnivore diet, Leo experienced stomach pains and diarrhea, likely from the bacteria die–off due to lack of carbs and fiber in the diet.
</li><li><b>Impact of diet on productivity and creativity</b>: Reports significant improvements in work productivity, mental clarity, and brain fog since starting the carnivore diet, along with reduced need for sleep and no midday napping.
</li><li><b>Understanding autoimmunity and individual sensitivities</b>: Realizes the significant role one's genetic makeup and immune sensitivities play in response to certain foods, potentially linked to the evolutionary history or modern agricultural practices.
</li><li><b>Die–off symptoms during carnivore diet</b>: Leo experienced severe diarrhea and, later on, unexpected stomach pains at night, which he speculates may be die–off symptoms of the gut bacteria due to the lack of carbs and fiber, commonly the foods that feed such bacteria.
</li><li><b>The plan for tackling SIBO</b>: Leo intends to strictly follow a carnivore diet for at least a month, hoping that this period will be enough to significantly impact his SIBO condition, despite experiencing recent stomach issues possibly related to the diet.
</li><li><b>Reflection on various treatments</b>: After attempting a wide array of treatments from numerous doctors and diets to various supplements, Leo found that the carnivore diet gave him significant mental clarity and energy improvements unlike any other method he tried over the past decade.
</li><li><b>Carnivore diet benefits and concerns</b>: The diet has improved symptoms and work productivity substantially, but concerns about long–term health risks like heart disease, its monotonous nature, and high costs remain, particularly with preference to grass–fed meat.
</li><li><b>Future dietary plans</b>: After attempting to resolve SIBO with the carnivore diet, Leo plans a slow reintroduction of plant foods, one at a time, to identify and eliminate any specific foods that trigger his immune responses.
</li><li><b>Complexity of food reintroduction</b>: Pinpointing specific trigger foods involves introducing them one at a time to monitor the body's response, requiring meticulous tracking and patience, as it could take months due to the risk of symptom flare–ups.
</li><li><b>Utility of specialized online forums</b>: Recommends using forums where individuals share personal experiences and methods for dealing with conditions like SIBO, instead of relying on conventional medical websites that often provide generic information.
</li><li><b>Self–research and tailor–made solutions</b>: Leo urges taking personal responsibility in resolving complex health issues by seeking those who have cured similar conditions and replicating their methods, underlining the distinction between generic advice and solutions that cater to individual needs.
</li><li><b>Healthiest diet misconception</b>: No single diet is universally best for all humans due to individual genetics and health conditions. A whole food plant–based diet may promote longevity for most, but those with specific issues require tailored diets.
</li><li><b>Carnivore diet continuation</b>: Planning to stick with the carnivore diet for a couple of months to address SIBO before reintroducing plant foods and identifying autoimmune triggers with the goal of reaching an optimal diet balance.
</li><li><b>Skeptical yet hopeful experimentation</b>: Despite skepticism from past failures, Leo is desperate for a solution and remains open to trying new approaches, signaling a commitment to finding what works for his health.
</li><li><b>Advice for others with health issues</b>: Encourages those struggling with autoimmune or mysterious ailments to not lose hope, conduct deep research, and seek out success stories from forums rather than standard medical information.
</li><li><b>Importance of controlled experimentation</b>: Stresses the significance of testing one variable at a time in a disciplined and emotionally challenging manner to obtain clear answers about what affects one's health.
</li><li><b>Underestimating diet's significance</b>: Points out the common underestimation of diet's impact on health. Emphasizes the necessity for disciplined eating habits and warns against convenience–driven food choices.
</li><li><b>Individual immune response to diet</b>: Reiterates that a food's general healthfulness is irrelevant if it triggers a negative immune response in an individual, underscoring the personal nature of diet and nutrition.
</li><li><b>Avoiding dietary ideologies</b>: Advises against subscribing to dietary ideologies and highlights the necessity of finding a diet that works for an individual's unique genetic makeup and metabolism.
</li><li><b>Diet experimentation and mindfulness</b>: Discusses the need for direct diet experimentation and being acutely aware of how specific foods affect one's health within hours of consumption, highlighting the power of the elimination diet.
</li><li><b>Personal health journey and diet's role</b>: Shares the journey of dealing with SIBO and thyroid issues, emphasizing diet's pivotal role and committing to the ongoing process of identifying the optimal lifelong diet.
</li><li><b>Correlation between sensitivity and spirituality/consciousness</b>: Suggests a potential link between an individual's level of spirituality or consciousness and their sensitivity to toxins, affecting thought patterns and spiritual pursuits.
</li><li><b>Physical health's impact on life and pleasures</b>: Notes how health issues like brain fog or gut problems can reduce a person's capacity to pursue higher goals, leading to a reliance on immediate physical pleasures such as food and sex.
</li><li><b>Aligning diet with life purpose</b>: Asserts that optimizing one's diet is crucial to clear mental states, facilitating the alignment with one's life purpose rather than being distracted by lower–level cravings.
</li><li><b>Holistic connection to self–actualization</b>: Leo highlights that issues like health, nutrition, physical exercise, and brain chemistry are foundational to successful self–actualization and spiritual work. Failure to address these can hinder progress in consciousness practices.
</li><li><b>Negative impact of health issues</b>: Discusses how digestive problems and toxins can obscure consciousness, likening the grogginess from bad foods to an "anti–psychedelic effect." Leo emphasizes that resolving core health problems should precede attempts to awaken spiritually.
</li><li><b>Importance of foundational health</b>: Advocates for focusing on essential health pillars before pursuing meditation or consciousness work. Suggests that once physical health is addressed, practices like meditation might become more effortless and effective.
</li><li><b>Research and persistence in health solutions</b>: Leo urges those with health struggles to do in–depth research beyond superficial online medical advice, maintaining hope in finding solutions and trying various treatments and methods.
</li><li><b>Health problems as a test of character</b>: Frames health challenges as tests that require creativity, flexibility, and a rigorous process of elimination to identify effective treatments. Demonstrates perseverance by recounting his own efforts to find a solution to ongoing stomach pains.
</li><li><b>Skepticism toward 'bad genetics' excuses</b>: Critiques the tendency to attribute health issues to genetics without considering environmental factors and lifestyle choices, encouraging personal responsibility for one's health alongside skepticism of such excuses.
</li><li><b>Impact of societal influences on health</b>: Describes how modern society's nutrition and health advice are compromised by corporate interests, leading to a culture where detrimental health conditions are normalized, and self–empowerment is essential to overcome these influences.
</li><li><b>Customization of health and spiritual journey</b>: Emphasizes the necessity of tailoring health treatments and spiritual practices to individual needs and circumstances, stressing that one should not rely solely on the experiences or advice of others.
</li><li><b>Personal Experiences with Psychedelics</b>: Leo shares that methods like plugging psychedelics work for him, but not for everyone. He emphasizes that individual reactions vary and encourages trying different approaches without getting demotivated by failures.
</li><li><b>Value of Experimentation</b>: Leo underscores the importance of experimentation in finding what works for oneself across various life domains, including health, spirituality, and relationships, and the necessity of patience and resilience through the process.
</li><li><b>Embracing Trial and Error</b>: Leo likens life to being a scientist in a lab, highlighting the necessity to tolerate and learn from numerous failures to achieve occasional victories that lead to significant progress.
</li><li><b>Responsibility for One's Life</b>: Leo emphasizes that no external authority, including religions or gurus, can assemble a great life for you; it's an individual's responsibility to persistently craft their own life through customization and experimentation.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Hope and Vision</b>: The importance of keeping hope alive and being your own cheerleader, especially during low points, is stressed by Leo. He points out that one's lowest moments often occur in solitude, underscoring the role of self–motivation.
</li><li><b>Perception vs. Reality of Happiness</b>: Leo challenges the assumption that others are always happier and healthier, explaining that happiness can be an illusion either because it's projected by us or because others may be hiding their suffering.
</li><li><b>Life's Flexibility and Improvisation</b>: He reflects on the need for flexibility in life's plans, encouraging improvisation to make the most of unexpected opportunities and twists, rather than adhering to a rigid life trajectory.
</li><li><b>Life as an Adventure and Interactive Play</b>: Leo compares life to an adventure game or a jazz band, suggesting that one should embrace improvisation, risk–taking, and creativity to find their unique path and reach flow states, instead of executing a predetermined script. 
</li><li><b>Integration of Life's Tangents and Health Journey</b>: Lastly, Leo connects the themes of life's improvisational nature and health challenges, promising to keep his audience updated on his health journey and inspiring hope for managing their own health conditions.
