            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/why-the-media-is-corrupt' target='_blank'>Why The Media Is Corrupt</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Media corruption and existential relevance</b>: Leo discusses media corruption, asserting it is deeply entwined with existential issues and the workings of the human mind, impacting our awakening and perception of reality, beyond mere partisan concerns.
</li><li><b>Media's alignment with cultural norms</b>: Rather than bias towards a political side, the media tends to mirror and reinforce mainstream culture and the status quo, misunderstood by both conservatives and liberals.
</li><li><b>Complexity of media operation</b>: Media bias narratives oversimplify the dynamics within media institutions which function as giant bureaucracies, not controlled by any single group.
</li><li><b>Role of epistemology in media</b>: Leo emphasizes that media bias must be understood through the lens of epistemology, which includes the study of worldviews, belief systems, and relativism, areas often overlooked by journalists and news anchors.
</li><li><b>Relativism and media perceptions</b>: Leo explains that perspectives on media are entirely relative; what one group sees as biased, another sees as truth. Recognition of this relativity is crucial to transcending biased viewpoints.
</li><li><b>Differentiating CNN and Fox News</b>: He contends that CNN is more honest and conscious than Fox News, not because of political leanings, but due to higher levels of self–awareness and understanding among its journalists.
</li><li><b>Going beyond political tribalism</b>: The real issue, according to Leo, is transcending the political left–right paradigm by focusing on the conscious understanding of epistemology and the construction of reality.
</li><li><b>Personal biases of journalists</b>: News reporting involves personal and political biases. Attempts at objective journalism by figures like Anderson Cooper may actually be more deceptive than openly biased reporting because they hide personal opinions under a guise of neutrality.
</li><li><b>Anderson Cooper's neutrality</b>: Anderson Cooper presents himself as a neutral figure in the media, maintaining a sense of balance for his career despite having personal opinions on various social and political issues.
</li><li><b>Exploitation of neutrality</b>: The pretense of neutrality is susceptible to manipulation, allowing extreme positions like pro–slavery arguments to gain unwarranted airtime, effectively shifting public discourse in a harmful direction.
</li><li><b>Fallacy of neutral midpoint</b>: The approach of finding a truth halfway between two positions is flawed, potentially leading to delusion since truth might be significantly skewed toward one side, highlighting the need for a commitment to seek truth regardless of its popularity or comfort.
</li><li><b>Survival agenda of news programs</b>: News shows operate with a survival agenda, necessitating high ratings and advertiser satisfaction. This drive for survival impacts content quality and forces shows to cater to the widest possible audience.
</li><li><b>Catch–22 of mainstream content</b>: The mainstream media, including news, must produce low–consciousness content to cater to a broad audience and ensure survival, effectively reflecting and reinforcing societal ignorance and unconsciousness.
</li><li><b>Anchor's lifestyle and influence</b>: Popular anchors like Anderson Cooper rely on ratings for their income, lifestyle, and status. The appeal of high earnings, celebrity recognition, and societal benefits shapes the content they provide and their ability to maintain popularity.
</li><li><b>Symbiotic relationship of media and unconscious society</b>: The media, including leaders like Anderson Cooper and the viewers, perpetuate each other's unconsciousness and biases, creating a cycle of ignorance that is difficult to break.
</li><li><b>Mainstream media's business limitations</b>: Due to the symbiotic nature of this relationship, mainstream media is limited in the depth and consciousness of content it can afford to produce because it needs to cater to the lowest common denominator to survive.
</li><li><b>Advertising interests and media content</b>: Advertisers on news programs often promote low–consciousness products and services, which reflects and perpetuates the materialistic and unconscious priorities of both the media and its audience.
</li><li><b>Public's complicity in media bias</b>: Audiences often recognize media and corporations as "devils" but fail to see their own contribution to establishment biases. They criticize without acknowledging that as viewers, they are part of that establishment unless they've actively worked to become more conscious.
</li><li><b>National bias in reporting</b>: American media portrays international news, such as Middle East coverage, through an inherently American perspective. This distorts understanding and serves the country's collective interests rather than delivering objective insights.
</li><li><b>Effects of multicultural upbringing on perspective</b>: Leo's Russian origins and subsequent Americanization from a young age gave him a unique vantage point to observe and recognize the biases in both cultures, contributing to his understanding of the relativity of truth and perspective.
</li><li><b>American media's self–bias</b>: American news, as reported by outlets like CNN, seldom considers or explores non–American perspectives seriously. This self–bias precludes objective journalism, as the reporting caters to American viewers' expectations and identity.
</li><li><b>Challenges of objective reporting</b>: True objectivity in media is hindered by several factors: audiences' refusal to acknowledge biases, managerial and advertising influences, and journalists' inherent cultural programming and identification with their nationality.
</li><li><b>Human species bias</b>: News reporting commonly demonstrates a bias that values human life above other species. Leo critiques this as a non–objective stance that further distorts an already human–centric perspective on reality and truth.
</li><li><b>Society and media's role in human survival</b>: Society and its media construct reinforce cycles of programming that bolster human survival rather than the pursuit of truth. This underpins a self–serving, egotistical cycle many are unaware of due to lifelong cultural indoctrination.
</li><li><b>Cultural programming through media</b>: From childhood, people are indoctrinated by cultural artifacts such as Disney movies, news, and educational institutions. This "programming" instills existential, metaphysical, and epistemological assumptions that bolster societal self–interest.
</li><li><b>Conscious versus unconscious media</b>: The perceived problem of left versus right bias in the media is a misconception; the real issue is the level of consciousness. Media reflects the unconsciousness of society, with content not aimed at high consciousness due to the public's lack of appreciation for it.
</li><li><b>Improvements in consciousness</b>: Changes in collective consciousness are slow and often only noticeable over generations, with the death of one generation providing a clean slate for new cultural developments, while also transferring some old paradigms to the next.
</li><li><b>Symbiotic cultural parasite</b>: Culture acts as a symbiotic entity that provides survival advantages like science and medicine while also perpetuating harmful elements such as racism and white supremacy. Both beneficial advances and problematic aspects are transmitted together over time.
</li><li><b>Self–brainwashing species</b>: Human culture, including the media, creates and reinforces a self–brainwashing loop, indoctrinating individuals without their awareness. This phenomenon is not exclusive to regimes like North Korea but is also prevalent in subtler forms in Western cultures like America.
</li><li><b>American deceptive transparency</b>: The American culture, while appearing diverse and accepting, is deeply biased toward materialism, consumerism, and hyper–rationalism. These biases are often invisible to Americans who, like fish in water, do not notice the pervasive cultural norms surrounding them.
</li><li><b>Multiple biases influencing perception</b>: Individuals are influenced by various layers of bias, from personal to professional, national, and species–wide biases. These biases distort one's ability to see the world clearly, necessitating a transcendence of these factors to achieve objective perception.
</li><li><b>Media not liberal enough</b>: Mainstream media like MSNBC and CNN are criticized for not being liberal enough since as individuals become more conscious, they tend to adopt more liberal values. CNN and MSNBC anchors generally hold socially liberal views but remain bound by the necessity to align with the organization's values and audience expectations.
</li><li><b>CNN versus Fox News</b>: Working at CNN requires a higher level of cognitive and moral development compared to Fox News. CNN anchors can at least engage with neutrality and occasionally denounce outrageous statements or actions, while Fox News anchors lack the consciousness to work beyond ideological biases.
</li><li><b>Organizational values and media employment</b>: Media personnel must align with the values and biases of their respective organizations to gain and maintain employment. These values dictate the nature of content and limit the possibility of radical or transformative ideas being presented to the public.
</li><li><b>CNN anchors and majority opinions</b>: CNN anchors are comfortable expressing majority sentiments that align with well–established, uncontroversial societal norms but exhibit more caution on divisive issues like climate change or Trump's presidency.
</li><li><b>Media's role in culture vs. evolution</b>: Mainstream news organizations like CNN focus on profit and credibility rather than advancing culture towards visionary new stages. Leo's interest lies in guiding mankind's future evolution, necessitating discussions on metaphysics, epistemology, and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Cutting–edge vs. majority</b>: True progress involves being on the cutting edge, which, by definition, only includes a small percentage of society. The majority adhere to outdated systems, whether in technology, spirituality, or politics, reflecting a general resistance to new, radical ideas.
</li><li><b>The paradox of media neutrality</b>: CNN's pretense of neutrality actually perpetuates subconscious cultural biases, hindering progress. True neutrality is difficult to achieve and often conceals self–deception and cultural bias.
</li><li><b>Limitations of mainstream news education</b>: Mainstream news lacks in–depth discussions on crucial topics, opting for brief, superficial coverage. Serious education, particularly on philosophical and existential topics, is necessary for societal advancement but is currently absent from networks like CNN.
</li><li><b>Visionary leadership and societal inertia</b>: Progress requires visionary leaders who can imagine and work towards a more conscious society, despite facing significant resistance and criticism from those invested in maintaining the status quo.
</li><li><b>Inspirational figures like Tesla and da Vinci</b>: Individuals such as Nikola Tesla and Leonardo da Vinci accessed infinite intelligence through higher states of consciousness, providing breakthroughs that advanced humanity.
</li><li><b>Allegory of the enlightened ant</b>: The typical path of human progress is likened to a rare ant emerging from the colony to glimpse the stars, struggling to share this profound knowledge amid skepticism and inertia.
</li><li><b>Incremental societal change</b>: The spread of enlightening ideas is slow, with incremental acceptance over generations rather than immediate cultural transformation.
</li><li><b>Humanity's potential tipping point</b>: A critical mass must be reached for high–consciousness concepts to be considered normal and not fringe, which would signify humanity stepping out of its "dark ages."
</li><li><b>Vision for mainstream media's role in awakening</b>: Leo envisions a day when concepts like "reality as a hallucination" are mainstream and unquestioned, taught to the young as a crucial part of education.
</li><li><b>Leadership in consciousness elevation</b>: To effect real change, individuals must emerge as self–motivated leaders willing to withstand resistance and inspire others to elevate collective understanding.
</li><li><b>Solving media's existential problems</b>: The challenge for media is breaking through the status quo, changing minds that are attached to existing worldviews such as science, rationality, or religion.
</li><li><b>Commitment to transformational work</b>: Leo is dedicated to influencing and transforming the collective consciousness, a task that encompasses a spectrum of roles across different fields, not limited to his approach.
</li><li><b>Harnessing individual talents for collective progress</b>: Leo encourages a creative approach to elevating consciousness that leverages personal strengths and leads to innovative contributions in any field of work.
</li><li><b>The practicality of ideology and epistemology</b>: Understanding perception, beliefs, and ideology has concrete effects on individual lives and the minds of society, encompassing much more than theoretical constructs.
