            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5kzZdps9PG4' target='_blank'>True vs False Skepticism</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Distinction between True and False Skepticism</b>: Leo discusses the differences between the original ancient school of skepticism, Peronism, and modern skepticism, criticizing the latter for being dogmatic, which is the exact opposite of what skepticism originally stood against.
</li><li><b>Historical Backdrop of Peronism</b>: Peronism, named after Piero of Ellis, its founder, originated in ancient Greece and was influenced by Indian yogis who taught Piero about the fundamental uncertainty of all knowledge, which he then introduced to Greece.
</li><li><b>Epistemic Accuracy of Peronism</b>: Peronism is considered by Leo as the most accurate philosophical system epistemically and has been a significant influence in his personal growth and advanced self–actualization work. It's viewed as a practical philosophy with crucial insights for modern intellectuals.
</li><li><b>Piero's Chief Aim of Eudaimonia</b>: Eudaimonia, or living the good life, was the central goal of Piero's philosophy, emphasizing a life of philosophical reflection, truth–seeking, and living by principles of the ultimate good, distinct from the modern pursuit of pleasure and success.
</li><li><b>Skepticism's Rejection of Certainty</b>: Peronism argues that no knowledge can be known for certain, as both senses and reasoning are fallible and all reasoning for proof ultimately ends in groundlessness or infinite regress, leading to the conclusion that we must refrain from all dogmatic positions.
</li><li><b>Suspension of Judgment in Skepticism</b>: True skepticism involves suspending judgment on non–evident matters, avoiding any doctrinal views on the truth of things' nature, and acknowledging appearances as appearances without making existential claims beyond that.
</li><li><b>Peace of Mind in Skepticism</b>: The ultimate goal of skepticism, according to Peronism, is not simply to deny knowledge but to achieve tranquility of mind and eudaimonia by refraining from taking positions on uncertain matters and recognizing ideological conflicts as a futile game.
</li><li><b>Sextus Empiricus' Contribution</b>: Sextus Empiricus compiled the lessons of the Peronian school in his book "Outlines of Pyrrhonism," offering modern readers a comprehensive understanding of this classical skeptical philosophy.
</li><li><b>Yogis' Influence on Piro</b>: Indian yogis significantly impacted Piero's belief in the uncertainty of knowledge, leading to the inception of his skeptical philosophy, which heavily contrasts with prevailing Western beliefs in certainty and dogmatism.
</li><li><b>True Skepticism's Practical Philosophy</b>: True skepticism according to Peronism is not solely theoretical but has real–world implications for one's happiness levels. It is rooted in the pursuit of eudaimonia, understood as a tranquil state of mind rather than material acquisition. 
</li><li><b>Pitfalls of Definitive Positions on Good and Bad</b>: Leo explains that individuals who definitively label things as good or bad experience continuous unrest. Such judgments lead to an endless cycle of desire and fear of loss, resulting in perpetual mental perturbation rather than happiness.
</li><li><b>Skepticism's Path to Eudaimonia</b>: By refusing to take definitive positions on what constitutes good or bad, skeptics avoid the chase for material gains. This position leads to an absence of cravings and ultimately a quiet, unperturbed mind, which is the true path to achieving eudaimonia.
</li><li><b>Skepticism and the Infinite Regress of Proof</b>: Leo describes skepticism's recognition of the infinite regress problem: that every proof requires further proof, ad infinitum. This insight leads skeptics to avoid taking positions, as all ideologies ultimately rely on some form of unproven assumption or faith.
</li><li><b>Potential Alignment of Peronism and Non–Duality</b>: While skeptics deny taking positions, paradoxically, this refusal may lead to the realization of non–duality. Relativism, when taken to its extreme, can circle back to reveal an absolute truth, which is a key tenet in non–duality philosophy.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as the Third Way of Knowing</b>: Leo points out that Peronism may have overlooked a third way of knowing–direct consciousness. True understanding of reality might require more than just senses and reasoning; it could involve direct conscious experience, which ties into the pursuit of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Modern Skepticism vs. True Skepticism</b>: Modern skepticism is often characterized by an aggressive debunking mentality against spirituality and mysticism. Unlike true skepticism, which retains open–mindedness, modern skepticism tends to be militant and dogmatic.
</li><li><b>True Skepticism's Self–Reflective Nature</b>: Real skepticism continuously questions its own assumptions and limits, maintaining a self–aware and non–dogmatic approach. This kind of skepticism serves as a means for dismantling the ego rather than reinforcing it.
</li><li><b>The Dangers of False Skepticism</b>: False skepticism risks becoming entrenched in its paradigms, leading to closed–mindedness and a failure to apply skepticism to its own beliefs. It can give rise to paradigm lock, hindering personal and intellectual growth.
</li><li><b>Mindful Skepticism for Inner Tranquility</b>: True skeptics aim for open–mindedness, avoiding debates and conflicts, and focusing on inner tranquility. They see skepticism as a path to happiness and contentment, rather than a tool for ego gratification through argument and debunking.
</li><li><b>Radical Open–Mindedness and Humanism</b>: True skepticism fosters a compassionate, non–judgmental approach, as it abstains from taking strong positions or opinions and thus refrains from hate or superiority over others. It aims at tranquility of mind as the primary metric for assessing the quality of skepticism.
</li><li><b>Skepticism Leading to Spirituality</b>: Leo argues that true skepticism leads to spirituality, not by believing in God, but by cultivating complete open–mindedness and freedom from ideologies, which in turn leads to peace of mind, equated here with God.
</li><li><b>Inquiry and True Skepticism</b>: True skepticism enhances the ability to inquire without bias, preferences, or predefined views, resembling teachings in Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and non–dual philosophies, and prompting a perpetual state of inquiry.
</li><li><b>Practical Ramifications of Peronism</b>: Leo highlights the practical effects of Peronism, including radical open–mindedness which he credits with his own path to personal development, self–actualization, and high levels of consciousness. He underscores Peronism's profound transformative potential on everyday life aspects like relationships, careers, and life purpose.
</li><li><b>Peronism Promoting Pragmatism and Mindfulness</b>: Leo distinguishes Peronean pragmatism from materialistic pragmatism, pointing out that the former is about living life grounded in sensory experiences and sensations, which leads to mindfulness and eventual realization of the absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Vigilance Against Mind's Trickery</b>: Peronism serves as a safeguard against becoming ideologically stuck, allowing for the development of intellectual humility and the ability to engage with diverse ideologies in a non–judgmental manner.
</li><li><b>Holism and Ideological Freedom</b>: Leo elaborates on the freedom Peronism brings, allowing one to study and assimilate a broad spectrum of ideas and perspectives without becoming upset or dogmatic, fostering holistic learning and understanding.
</li><li><b>Philosophy of Ataraxia</b>: Peronism can lead to ataraxia, a lucid state of robust equanimity, as the pinnacle of practical philosophy, which Leo describes as a deeply profound and desirable state of tranquility of mind.
</li><li><b>Proper Use of Reasoning</b>: Emphasizing that reasoning is most useful when it acknowledges its own limitations, rather than arrogating to itself the position of the ultimate authority.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Modern Skepticism</b>: Leo warns against the risk of modern skepticism turning into a paradigm as dogmatic as the religious dogmatism it often opposes, potentially leading to the same problems of closed–mindedness and ignorance.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Limitations of Knowledge</b>: Leo encourages an awareness of the limitations of one's knowledge, advocating for humility and openness instead of claiming to know or hold strong positions.
</li><li><b>The Deep Paradigm of Dogma</b>: The problem with dogmatism is its pervasive nature, cutting across any belief system. Recognizing this can prevent the same errors perpetrated by dogmatic religions from recurring in the realm of science and skepticism.
</li><li><b>Danger of Dogmatic Skepticism</b>: Leo warns of the ease with which one can turn skepticism into a dogma. He cautions against embodying skepticism only externally without applying it inwardly, which can result in becoming a false skeptic and getting paradigm locked.
</li><li><b>Misusing Skepticism to Justify Negative Traits</b>: Leo identifies a potential pitfall where skepticism is used to excuse inaction, laziness, nihilism, or cruelty. He emphasizes that Peronism is not about neglecting responsibilities or leading an indecisive and depressed life, as this would not lead to eudaimonia or tranquility of mind.
</li><li><b>Inward Reflection and Active Engagement</b>: True skepticism should guide individuals to focus on internal development, leading to mindfulness, introspection, self–inquiry, and the dismantling of personal positions and attachments, aiming for self–improvement and tranquility.
</li><li><b>Link Between Peronism and Enlightenment</b>: Leo discusses how Peronism ideally positions one for pursuing enlightenment through non–duality practices, leading to the realization of Absolute Truth, which is itself an evident experience when one achieves high consciousness.
</li><li><b>Ego's Tendency to Create Identity from Skepticism</b>: He underscores the human tendency to turn everything, even the act of letting go of positions, into an identity by the ego. Leo advises against this, recommending studying "Outlines of Peronism" to avoid this trap and focus on achieving true peace of mind.
</li><li><b>Teachings as Tools for Liberation, Not Dogma</b>: Leo likens philosophical teachings to a laxative–they should be used to free the mind from attachments and then discarded. He encourages practical application and testing rather than blind acceptance or worship.
</li><li><b>Education Through Self–Actualization</b>: He stresses the importance of self–education and personal growth through Actualized.org, viewing it as critical content that is uncommon in mainstream culture but vital for transforming one's life and psyche. He notes that while the content is challenging, it is necessary for transformative development.
