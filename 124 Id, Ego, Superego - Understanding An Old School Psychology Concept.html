            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/GC7KNAyDt4I' target='_blank'>Id, Ego, Superego - Understanding An Old School Psychology Concept</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Summarization of 'Id, Ego, Superego' Concepts</b>: Leo introduces Freud's concepts of the id, ego, and superego and aims to apply these to modern personal development. He emphasizes understanding these parts of the psyche to improve self–control and overall happiness.
</li><li><b>Old School vs. Modern Psychology</b>: Freud's models are considered somewhat obsolete, but Leo believes there are still valuable lessons that can be applied practically today. He contrasts old analytical psychoanalytical approaches with more applicable ideas presented on actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Analogy for Id, Ego, and Superego</b>: An analogy from Jonathan Haight's book is used to describe Freud's concept: horses (id) represent basic desires seeking instant gratification, the rider (ego) symbolizes the conscious, rational control, and the critiquing father (superego) signifies societal moral standards. 
</li><li><b>Issues with Freud's Model</b>: Leo acknowledges the model's figurative nature and the difficulty in delineating specific roles within the psyche. He also points out that it does not literally represent the mind's workings.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Lower Self</b>: Leo explains the lower self as the source of short–term pleasure and easy stimulation, which can be destructive through developing bad habits, even those that society deems acceptable, like excessive TV watching or partying.
</li><li><b>Revising the Concept of the Higher Self</b>: Freud's superego is criticized for mixing societal and moralistic ideals; Leo suggests the 'higher self' should be understood instead as the more aware, conscious part of us striving for good beyond societal norms.
</li><li><b>Conscious vs. Unconscious Behavior</b>: He reminds that actions for lower values lead to an unconscious lifestyle, causing both self–destructive habits and broader societal harm. Conscious behavior, aligning with the higher self, stands opposed to that and should be the individual's goal.
</li><li><b>Unconscious Behavior Consequences</b>: Engaging in behaviors detrimental to health, relationships, career, or business is a sign of unconscious living, where the individual is not fully aware of the negative impacts of such actions.
</li><li><b>Higher Self Clarification</b>: The higher self is distinctly separate from the Freudian superego, as it embodies pure consciousness without the mix of critical judgment. It aims for personal growth without self–deprecation.
</li><li><b>Freud's Model Revision</b>: The critical aspect of the superego is better relocated to the id within Freud's model, allowing for a clearer distinction where the 'new' superego represents the higher, fully conscious self.
</li><li><b>Higher Self Attributes</b>: Being fully conscious equates to making the best decisions, long–term thinking, controlling impulses, and having complete awareness, leading to a fulfilling and at–peace life.
</li><li><b>Peace vs. Motivation</b>: Achieving peace through higher consciousness leads to a healthy emotional foundation that naturally encourages motivation and constructive action rather than laziness.
</li><li><b>Tug–of–War Within</b>: Individuals experience a constant internal struggle between aspirations of the lower self and the enlightened guidance of the higher self, which influences decision–making and actions.
</li><li><b>Personal Development Path</b>: Distinguishing between the lower and higher self is complex and requires introspection and experience. As one progresses, discipline and conscious living become more effortless and natural.
</li><li><b>Self–Actualization Realized</b>: When one can effortlessly guide themselves towards beneficial and high conscious actions, this is the essence of self–actualization, indicating a clear understanding of the higher self.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Conscious Development</b>: Leo highlights the importance of actively working on personal development to make healthy, conscious choices effortlessly and shares resources on actualized.org to facilitate this journey.
