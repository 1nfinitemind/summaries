            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/cpr-KFks6-c' target='_blank'>The Enlightened Self - A Description Of Your Existential Nature</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to the Enlightened Self</b>: Leo introduces the topic of the enlightened self, also known as the true self, giving an accurate description of one's existential nature. This advanced episode is aimed at helping those already engaged in self–inquiry on their spiritual journey to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Existential Nature and Identification Misconceptions</b>: Leo explores what our existential nature is and challenges the common identification with the body and mind. He suggests the radical notion that what we conventionally take ourselves to be–the human being inhabiting a body and mind–is nothing more than a story or belief indoctrinated from a young age.
</li><li><b>Empirical Claim About True Nature</b>: Leo makes an empirical claim that one can demonstrate the truth of not being a human being but instead falsely identifying with this belief, similar to a person mistakenly believing they are a coffee table.
</li><li><b>No Self Concept and True Self</b>: Clearing up potential misconceptions about the Buddhist concept of 'anatta' or 'no self', Leo elaborates that the term does not suggest non–existence but rather the non–existence of the ego or personal self. He differentiates between the little self (the illusion) and the higher true self, which is not linked to physicality but to something more profound and paradoxical.
</li><li><b>Existence as Nothingness</b>: Leo prompts viewers to contemplate the idea of existing as nothingness, distinguishing it from non–existence. He suggests that nothingness is a constant, unchanging presence amid the perpetual change of sensations, emotions, and thoughts.
</li><li><b>Practical Tips for Focusing on True Self</b>: He advises those practicing self–inquiry to shift the focus from proving non–existence to exploring the existence of the true self–what one could be if not aligned with the body or the mind–and to approach this investigation with open–mindedness.
</li><li><b>Description of the True Self</b>: Describing the true self is risky due to the creation of mental images that can be misleading. However, Leo believes it useful to guide seekers toward motivation and direction. He defines the true self as pure, transparent, empty awareness, distinct from physical or mental constructs. It is this empty awareness that one truly is.
</li><li><b>Terms for Empty Awareness</b>: Several terms are synonymous with empty awareness, such as consciousness, presence, and spirit. The last term, spirit, is historically defined as breath or air, hinting at the non–physical, essential quality of our true nature.
</li><li><b>Concept of True Self as Empty Space</b>: Leo describes the true self as akin to empty space, allowing for the existence and occurrence of all other things such as physical objects and immaterial experiences like emotions or thoughts. This empty space is not separate or enveloped within the physical world but is the fundamental container for space, time, and existence.
</li><li><b>Understanding Awareness as Container of Reality</b>: He explains that awareness is the essential quality of the true self, able to contain all experiences and reality itself. This awareness is transparent and serves as the space within which the entirety of one's experience occurs, much like emptiness allows a cup to hold liquid.
</li><li><b>Metaphor for Awareness as Empty Cup</b>: Leo uses the metaphor of a cup not being defined by its material construction but rather by the gap inside it which allows it to hold liquid, to explain the nature of awareness which holds experiences within reality.
</li><li><b>Radical Perspective Shift to Space Identification</b>: Imagining oneself as not a physical body but as empty physical space itself, he suggests, would be a profound paradigm shift. Yet, the reality goes even deeper, stating that we're even emptier than empty space–absolute zero, the very source of reality.
</li><li><b>Descriptions from an Enlightened Person</b>: Leo recounts conversations with a recently enlightened man who describes his enlightenment as a presence that's rock–solid, empty, transparent, eternal, and unshakable, grounding all experiences.
</li><li><b>Enlightened Presence as the Illuminator</b>: The nature of awareness is compared to a flashlight, which illuminates everything except itself. It sits in the background, humbly revealing all other experiences but staying hidden due to its self–effacing nature.
</li><li><b>Becoming Aware of Awareness as a Paradox</b>: The act of becoming conscious of awareness is likened to a flashlight trying to shine on itself, a task that seems nearly impossible as the mind struggles to turn its attention onto something that has no form, shape, or specific location.
</li><li><b>Existence of Nothingness</b>: Leo articulates that nothingness does exist, and it's not only possible but is the grounding element of all existence. He asserts that nothingness is so complete that it encompasses both nothing and everything, creating a paradox beyond rational comprehension.
</li><li><b>Analogy of Existence with Black Holes</b>: He draws an analogy between human existence and black holes in space–time, suggesting our consciousness has a similar singularity that leads to non–existence and infinity. This awareness is like a vast field, omnipresent, alive, and infinitely large, yet it has no tangible characteristics like shape or color and cannot be perceived through senses or thought process.
</li><li><b>Self, Awareness, and Non–separation</b>: Leo explains that while this field of awareness within which all experiences occur may seem separate, it is actually non–separate from the objects and experiences we encounter. To understand this vast field of pure empty awareness, one has to train the mind to become aware of awareness itself.
</li><li><b>Inability to Conceptualize Enlightenment</b>: The mind cannot grasp the concept of nothingness, rendering it impossible to think your way into enlightenment. All mental images and stories about enlightenment are ultimately misconceptions.
</li><li><b>The True Self is Not Hidden</b>: A common misstep in self–inquiry is to seek the true self as if it were a hidden object or an energy field. This approach is flawed because the true self is not located anywhere, and the idea of searching for nothingness is paradoxical.
</li><li><b>Addiction to Spatial and Object Imagery</b>: The human mind is wired to understand things in terms of images, space, and objects. This tendency hinders the understanding of enlightenment, which is not an object and cannot be visualized or located.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions to Avoid in Self–Inquiry</b>: To progress in self–inquiry, avoid trying to identify with objects, see or feel oneself, or to locate oneself spatially. Also, challenge the assumption of being a human being or any kind of object.
</li><li><b>Persistence and Habit in Self–Inquiry</b>: Effective self–inquiry requires commitment and regular practice, possibly dedicating significant daily time to this pursuit.
</li><li><b>Constant Presence of True Self</b>: The true self is always there, unaffected by life's changing circumstances. It is ever–present, preceding birth and outlasting death, yet often overlooked due to its humility.
</li><li><b>Goal of Self–Inquiry</b>: Self–inquiry serves to purge the delusions and fantasies about the self, leading to a realization of the 'nothing' that is always in plain sight, right in front of us.
</li><li><b>Forum and Newsletter for Support</b>: Leo highlights Actualized.org's forum and newsletter as resources for individuals dedicated to personal development, offering a community for discussion and mutual support.
