            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/W7bRGzFt2oE' target='_blank'>Why Am I Depressed - The Shocking Truth Behind Your Depression</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Epidemic of Depression</b>: Leo outlines depression as a widespread issue, particularly in developed nations, where there is a notable increase in depressive symptoms among the population.
</li><li><b>Blunt Diagnosis</b>: He suggests that the underlying reason for most instances of depression is not clinical or genetic but rather rooted in "bad psychology," encouraging non–clinical cases to take responsibility for their mental state and personal development.
</li><li><b>Clinical vs. Psychological Causes</b>: While Leo acknowledges the existence of clinical depression that may require medical treatment, he insists that even in these cases, psychology plays a crucial role and should not be overlooked.
</li><li><b>Responsibility for Personal Happiness</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of self–responsibility over victimhood, stressing that individuals have significant control over their psychological state, which influences their level of happiness.
</li><li><b>Genetics and Happiness Set Point</b>: He references studies showing that around 50% of happiness is genetically determined, but maintains that addressing one's mindset and psychological software is vital.
</li><li><b>Self–Absorption Leads to Depression</b>: Leo identifies excessive self–identification and ego as major influences on depression. He suggests that a self–absorption tendency deeply ingrains negative thought patterns and contributes to a negative self–image.
</li><li><b>Negative Subconscious Beliefs</b>: He posits that beliefs about oneself held on a subconscious level, originating from past experiences or trauma, can perpetuate depressive states.
</li><li><b>Relationship Struggles as a Depression Factor</b>: Leo discusses how relationship issues, stemming from insecurities and the need for external approval, can exacerbate depression.
</li><li><b>Meditation and Present–Moment Focus</b>: He advocates for meditation as a practical tool for addressing depression, claiming that consistent meditation fosters presence and can significantly alleviate depressive symptoms.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Ego and Enlightenment</b>: Leo explains that grasping the illusory nature of the ego is an advanced concept tied to enlightenment and meditation, which could lead to a deeper understanding of depression's roots.
</li><li><b>Real Happiness through Egolessness</b>: Leo emphasizes that genuine happiness is a natural state when the ego is removed, and that feelings of depression vanish in the present moment when one taps into this state.
</li><li><b>Persistence in Meditation Practice</b>: For those new to meditation, initial discomfort is normal. Leo suggests starting small and gradually increasing the practice to reach moments of pure happiness.
</li><li><b>Depression as a Self–Created State</b>: Emphasizing the importance of introspection, Leo argues that much of our depression is self–created and that true happiness comes from within, not from external sources.
</li><li><b>Value–Based Living</b>: Depression can be exacerbated by living out of alignment with one's core values; addressing this can reduce feelings of guilt and procrastination which fuel depressive tendencies.
</li><li><b>Authenticity as a Cure for Depression</b>: Inauthentic behavior and people–pleasing contribute to depression. Leo encourages living authentically and understanding that fulfillment is inherently internal.
</li><li><b>Introspection to Combat Depression</b>: Leo insists on repeated exposure to the idea that one's ego and inauthenticity are at the root of depression, advocating for personal responsibility and acceptance.
</li><li><b>Meditation as a Daily Necessity</b>: Stressing the importance of meditation, Leo recommends daily practice to manage depressive symptoms, treating it as essential for wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Exercise as an Antidepressant</b>: Citing research, Leo promotes physical exercise for its effectiveness in relieving depression, noting its benefits outlast those of medication.
</li><li><b>Aligning Actions with Values</b>: He advises identifying personal values and living in accordance with them, suggesting that not doing so contributes to a lack of fulfillment and depression.
</li><li><b>Purpose and Depression</b>: Leo contends that a lack of life purpose is commonly linked to depression; having a strong sense of purpose, particularly one that involves serving others, can be protective against depression.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as an Ultimate Solution</b>: Recommending spiritual practices aimed at enlightenment, Leo suggests that this will lead to the experience of a natural state of bliss, countering depressive states.
</li><li><b>Vision Beyond Depression</b>: Rather than merely overcoming depression, Leo urges listeners to aim for an exceptional life, emphasizing the value of big goals, purpose, and personal development resources available on Actualized.org.
