            <ul>
    <li><b>Extended meditation regimen</b>: Leo allocated nearly nine hours to meditation with various techniques, emphasizing labeling and breath focus, which provided a sense of ease and pleasantness.
</li><li><b>Contemplation on practice variety</b>: He questioned whether to incorporate more variety into his practice as focusing solely on the breath seemed too simplistic, triggering a concern about potentially overlooking other aspects.
</li><li><b>Insight into the 'true self'</b>: Leo encountered a profound realization regarding his attachment to the 'primordial self,' perceiving it as emptiness, non–localizable, and transcending physical and metaphysical bounds.
</li><li><b>Readiness for deeper self–inquiry</b>: Despite the breakthroughs, Leo plans to engage in strict mindfulness and labeling in the upcoming days to prime himself for intense self–inquiry sessions intended for the retreat's last days.
</li><li><b>Transition to a more arduous phase</b>: He's beginning to experience the 'grind,' where the novelty of techniques wears off, leading into a period of spiritual purification that brings forth challenging emotions but is essential for growth.
</li><li><b>Awareness of mental diversions</b>: Leo stays mindful of the mind's deceptive tendencies to distract from the path, especially during periods of discomfort, signifying pivotal moments for potential breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>Endurance through monotony</b>: He likens the repetitive nature of his meditation practice to moths repetitively hitting against a window, representing a persistent yet somewhat directionless effort hoping for enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Concluding day four</b>: Recognizing his fatigue, Leo contemplates an additional hour of meditation or an early rest to prepare for the next day, signaling the wrap–up of day four's meditative journey.
