            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6vVIbPdfjxg' target='_blank'>What Is Actualized.org - The Big Picture of Personal Development</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Actualized.org</b>: Actualized.org is Leo Gura's created catalog of powerful life concepts aimed at providing a holistic understanding of life and reality, guiding users on how to live an optimal life by bringing together a cohesive image of various principles with a broad and deep scope.
</li><li><b>Materialist paradigm critique</b>: Leo criticizes the prevalent materialist paradigm for underestimating the influence of the mind in shaping reality, proclaiming that many people live within severe limitations, not fully tapping into their human potential which he estimates at a mere one to three percent.
</li><li><b>Holistic life understanding</b>: Leo Gura advocates for an inward focus and profound questioning of one's own life machinery to really understand how to live well. He seeks to develop a comprehensive 'instruction manual' for life, acknowledging the complexity and unique aspects influencing each individual's existence.
</li><li><b>Life's mysteries and self–exploration</b>: Leo reflects on the mysterious aspects of life questioning how we came to exist and our ultimate purpose, emphasizing the importance of self–understanding at physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual levels, which he believes society fails to teach.
</li><li><b>Mind as life's gatekeeper</b>: The mind is portrayed as the mediator of all life experiences, framing the importance of the mind's role as paramount. Leo stresses that controlling and understanding the mind can lead to passionate living and mitigate life's mediocrity and suffering. 
</li><li><b>Ongoing journey of self–improvement</b>: Leo equates passionate living with the continuous process of self–improvement. He argues that life becomes truly fulfilling when we commit to personal growth as a lifelong project, rather than settling for a utilitarian existence once basic needs and wants are met.
</li><li><b>Survival vs deeper fulfillment</b>: Leo discusses the widespread plight of living merely at a survival level, which can lead to depression and frustration. He urges seeking fulfillment beyond the mere satisfaction of survival needs, connecting deeply with life itself at emotional, intuitive, and spiritual levels.
</li><li><b>Non–dogmatic approach of Actualized.org</b>: Leo clarifies that unlike other ideologies or religions, Actualized.org is built on a foundation that avoids dogmatism or speculation. Instead, it provides principles and concepts that individuals can validate themselves, making personal validation the basis for truth.
</li><li><b>Self–validation over external belief</b>: Leo maintains that one should not trust or believe anyone blindly, including himself. Instead, individuals should undertake a serious commitment to investigate matters for themselves, validating knowledge through personal experience.
</li><li><b>The mind as a programmed computer</b>: He likens the human mind to a computer, pre–programmed with beliefs and assumptions from early life, often without question. Leo believes this programming is the gatekeeper to our life results and challenges individuals to question their pre–installed programs to change their lives.
</li><li><b>Taking responsibility for change</b>: Advocating for personal responsibility, Leo insists that better life quality comes from one's internal change rather than blaming external factors. He emphasizes that individuals can only transform their life situation by taking control of their thoughts and actions.
</li><li><b>Mind's role in perpetuating negative patterns</b>: Leo argues that one's mind, if not understood or controlled, keeps them stuck in patterns that lead to subpar life outcomes like demotivation and dissatisfaction, and changing the mind is the key to resolving these issues.
</li><li><b>Layers of mental programming and change</b>: Using the analogy of computer software, Leo discusses various levels of mental programming from superficial apps to fundamental operating systems. He encourages a deep overhaul, not just rearranging surface beliefs but questioning and revising the core operating system of one's worldview for significant life change.
</li><li><b>Jailbreaking the mind for potential</b>: To tap into one's true potential and achieve significant life changes, Leo suggests "jailbreaking" the mind, which involves going beyond standard programming and operating systems to do things that others can't, an allusion to breaking free from conventional life scripts.
</li><li><b>Real Change at the Kernel Level</b>: Leo describes the goal of Actualized.org as going beyond superficial self–help advice and down to the "kernel level" of the mind, likening it to jailbreaking a phone, to access and enable profound transformation and unlock ‘superhuman' potential.
</li><li><b>Societal Ignorance and Fear</b>: He notes that most of society, including professionals like doctors, scientists, and self–help gurus, are either unaware of the deeper work of personal transformation or actively discourage it due to fear, misunderstanding, or misconceptions, labeling it as crazy, cult–like, or mere philosophy.
</li><li><b>Closed vs. Open Operating Systems</b>: Leo criticizes closed mindsets similar to Apple's ecosystem–simple but restrictive–favoring an open–minded approach like a Linux operating system, which requires more effort but allows for greater freedom and potential fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Societal Programming and Individual Potential</b>: He states that societal programming through education and norms does not aim to maximize individual potential or teach how to live the best life possible, due to a cultural lack of understanding of what a 'good life' truly is.
</li><li><b>The Dark Ages of Personal Development</b>: Leo comments on the current state of knowledge and personal development, likening it to the “dark ages” where there is a significant lack of comprehensive understanding and teaching on how to live effectively and fulfill one's potential.
</li><li><b>Jailbreaking the Mind</b>: He compares personal transformation to the process of jailbreaking a phone–tricky, risky, and requiring perseverance and a dedication to lifelong learning and growth to truly achieve higher levels of development.
</li><li><b>Objective vs. Subjective Reality</b>: Leo challenges the belief in an objective world separate from the mind, asserting that the mind's operating system can be changed, affecting one's experience of reality, and notes the complexity of navigating through and unlocking the mind's potential.
</li><li><b>Resisting Internal Anti–Jailbreaking Mechanisms</b>: He describes the mind as having in–built resistance to change, which aims to maintain its current reality–construction function, making the journey of self–transformation paradoxical and full of internal conflict.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for Personal Liberation</b>: Leo's role, as he sees it, is to offer guidance and inspiration to people who seek more from life instead of succumbing to societal pressures and fear–mongering from both others and their own minds.
</li><li><b>The Loneliness of Advancing Beyond Society</b>: He warns of the loneliness and risks associated with pursuing growth beyond societal norms, as one moves away from the "herd" and faces new challenges without widespread support or resources.
</li><li><b>Non–ideological approach</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of self–testing and validating the concepts from Actualized.org against one's own experiences, rather than adopting them as ideology. Ideas should only be retained if they lead to a positive transformation in life.
</li><li><b>Writing one's life manual</b>: He points out that creating an instruction manual for life is complex, as it must be tailored to the individual's unique genetic makeup, personality, life circumstances, desires, and fears.
</li><li><b>Questioning one's desires</b>: Leo discusses the common failure to examine whether one's desires are truly valid or whether they are the result of societal programming, warning that unexamined desires may lead to a fruitless pursuit of fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Emotional manipulation and the mind's control</b>: He argues that, despite the emphasis on logic, human behavior is primarily dictated by emotions, which the mind uses to manipulate reactions and decisions.
</li><li><b>Mind's resistance to change</b>: Leo highlights the mind's tendency to resist change despite desiring its benefits, explaining this resistance as a fear of the unknown and the fear of death, which change metaphorically represents.
</li><li><b>The paradox of change</b>: He acknowledges that while change is desired for improvement, it often comes with a cost, possibly leading to initial deterioration before betterment.
</li><li><b>Personal transformation</b>: Leo suggests that to achieve deeper fulfillment, one must be willing to undergo radical transformation, which can feel akin to letting an older version of oneself die.
</li><li><b>Limitations of compartmentalized knowledge</b>: He criticizes the siloed nature of modern knowledge domains such as science and philosophy and advocates for a holistic understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>CEO mindset for personal development</b>: Leo encourages treating personal development like a CEO by integrating advice from various domains of life, creating a comprehensive approach to one's goals and aspirations.
</li><li><b>Enjoying the journey of self–improvement</b>: He urges embracing the process of self–improvement, highlighting the importance of enjoying the journey, not just the destination.
</li><li><b>Philosophy as essential for understanding life</b>: Leo criticizes traditional views of philosophy and advocates for a practical philosophy that seeks deep understanding and embodiment of life's realities.
</li><li><b>Critique of current academic philosophy</b>: He laments the lack of focus on personal transformation in academic philosophy, which he perceives as disconnected from the pursuit of understanding life and reality.
</li><li><b>Role of philosophy in personal development</b>: Leo posits that philosophy should be pursued with the goal of deeply understanding reality to the extent that it transforms the philosopher themselves.
</li><li><b>Philosophy as the Foundation of Knowledge</b>: Leo criticizes the neglect of philosophy in modern education, asserting its primary role in understanding reality. Fields such as physics and psychology are deemed incomplete as they overlook underlying philosophical issues, leading to stagnation in true understanding.
</li><li><b>Embodying Philosophical Wisdom</b>: Leo stresses the importance of embodying philosophical insights, transcending theoretical understanding. True knowledge should transform an individual's core, not just operate at a superficial level.
</li><li><b>Scientific Specialization and Personal Growth</b>: Leo condemns the fragmentation in sciences, emphasizing that scientists often fail to apply their work to personal transformation, which should be the ultimate goal of understanding reality.
</li><li><b>Pursuing Self–Understanding as Enlightenment</b>: Leo encourages deep self–study as a means to enlightenment, quoting ancient wisdom that states "Know thyself". This inward journey is seen as essential to truly understand the wider world and reality.
</li><li><b>Total Understanding of Reality as a Goal</b>: Leo claims it is possible to fully understand reality, challenging the widely–held belief that it is an unattainable goal. He promotes a journey beyond survival needs, towards a comprehensive grasp of existence.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Radical Ideas and Personal Growth</b>: Leo warns of the radical nature of his teachings and the personal changes they may entail. He urges a serious commitment to life beyond mere survival needs, envisioning a profound connection with existence itself.
</li><li><b>Importance of a Profound Connection with Life</b>: Leo argues that a deep, emotional connection to life and consciousness–beyond material desires–is key to a fulfilling existence. This practice of spirituality should increase a person's connection to the profundity of life.
</li><li><b>Engineering the Good Life</b>: Leo explains that living the good life–a life infused with profound connection–requires individual effort to overcome societal programming. He asserts that the knowledge on how to lead such a life has existed for thousands of years but requires personal initiative to realize.
</li><li><b>Utilizing Knowledge for Personal Transformation</b>: Leo invites viewers to explore his catalog of content with a view towards serious application and personal transformation, developing a compelling vision that inspires action towards achieving a profound connection with life.
