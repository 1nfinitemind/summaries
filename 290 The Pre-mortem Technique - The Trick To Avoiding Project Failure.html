            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/zdA_8xjFcqc' target='_blank'>The Pre-mortem Technique - The Trick To Avoiding Project Failure</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Pre–mortem Technique Introduction</b>: Leo introduces the pre–mortem technique as a proactive strategy used to prevent failure in projects by analysing potential failure points ahead of project initiation.
</li><li><b>Conceptual Contrast</b>: Pre–mortem is positioned in contrast to the post–mortem where analysis occurs post–project; pre–mortem involves envisioning and analyzing potential failure causes before a project starts.
</li><li><b>Including Psychological Factors</b>: Leo emphasizes that the pre–mortem should encompass not just external factors but also internal psychological reasons for potential failure, such as self–sabotage.
</li><li><b>Practical Application of Pre–mortem</b>: He encourages applying the pre–mortem to both professional projects and personal endeavors, citing examples like marriage, weight loss, starting a business, and finding life purpose.
</li><li><b>Visualizing Failure</b>: The method involves vividly imagining the project failing entirely before commencement, then rigorously brainstorming and listing foreseeable causes of failure.
</li><li><b>Strategic Thinking Emphasis</b>: Leo reminds viewers that the pre–mortem is part of strategic thinking, which should be employed in all important life endeavors, not just work–related projects.
</li><li><b>Listing Causes of Failure</b>: After visualizing failure, one should create a detailed list of all possible causes of failure, prioritizing them from most threatening to least likely.
</li><li><b>Developing Solutions</b>: For each potential failure point listed, especially the top three, specific and realistic solutions should be brainstormed to preemptively tackle these issues.
</li><li><b>Personal Introspection</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of personal introspection for identifying top potential causes of failure related to one's own weaknesses and psychological tendencies.
</li><li><b>Realistic Examples Given</b>: Through the example of starting a new business, Leo provides a realistic set of potential failure reasons including economic downturns, being outperformed by competitors, personal habits like procrastination, technical skill gaps, and losing vision or motivation.
</li><li><b>Holistic Perspective</b>: Suggesting a holistic approach, Leo instructs to consider both internal and external factors, practical and subtle psychological causes when preparing the pre–mortem list.
</li><li><b>Pre–mortem Benefits</b>: Leo asserts that the pre–mortem technique can provide a sobering perspective on what it will take to succeed, thereby increasing the chances of project success.
</li><li><b>Personal Psychological Weaknesses</b>: Leo acknowledges his propensity for getting bored and losing focus, recognizing these traits as significant personal weaknesses that could potentially undermine his projects.
</li><li><b>Identifying Top Psychological Challenges</b>: He advises isolating and prioritizing the top three personal psychological challenges or "inner demons," foreseeing how they might contribute to failure, particularly in business.
</li><li><b>Brainstorming Solutions</b>: Leo suggests brainstorming realistic and practical solutions for each identified cause of failure, addressing potential distractions, accidental life changes like starting a family prematurely, burnout, financial insecurity fears, and self–doubt preventively.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem in Career Planning</b>: He stresses the importance of applying the pre–mortem technique to one's entire career, not just individual projects. By considering future career failure and its potential psychological causes, one can proactively save their career.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Life Purpose</b>: Leo highlights the use of the pre–mortem technique in assessing the potential failure of one's life purpose. Anticipating challenges that can affect achieving life goals is crucial.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Educational Goals</b>: The technique is also useful for academic pursuits, such as planning for college, where pre–emptively addressing potential reasons for failure can influence academic success and prevent dropping out.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Weight Loss</b>: He points out the effectiveness of pre–mortem in weight loss efforts by confronting psychological hurdles based on past failures and planning solutions for each challenge.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for General Life Planning</b>: Leo encourages applying pre–mortem thinking to one's entire life, to envision and address factors that could lead to an overall life failure, focusing on psychological influences and personal weaknesses.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Spiritual Goals</b>: For those seeking enlightenment or spiritual growth, pre–mortem can predict potential setbacks to spiritual endeavors and help in devising strategies to overcome them.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Hobbies and Relationships</b>: Applying this strategy to new hobbies, relationships, or marriage can help identify psychological obstacles and create a plan to navigate these complex areas.
</li><li><b>Pre–Mortem for Travel and Annual Goals</b>: Whether planning travel or setting annual goals, pre–mortem identifies reasons for potential failure, encourages proactive planning, and formulates solutions to prevent repeating past mistakes.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Examples of Pre–Mortem</b>: Leo shares personal instances where the pre–mortem technique has been instrumental in significant life changes, such as moving cities and starting his platform, Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Exercise and Worksheet Encouragement</b>: He encourages us to apply the pre–mortem technique to a chosen life project using a free downloadable worksheet, emphasizing the importance of experiencing the satisfaction of strategic, proactive thinking.
</li><li><b>Balanced Strategic Thinking Importance</b>: Leo warns against overanalysis and urges a balanced approach to strategic thinking that combines big–picture vision with attention to practical details, ensuring intuition and logic work in tandem.
</li><li><b>Continuous Personal Development</b>: He concludes by inspiring viewers to invest in their self–growth through practical learning, which will result in greater life prospects and more effective strategies to overcome challenges and achieve goals.
