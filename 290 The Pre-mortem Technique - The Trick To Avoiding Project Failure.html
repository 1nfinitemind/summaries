            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/zdA_8xjFcqc' target='_blank'>The Pre-mortem Technique - The Trick To Avoiding Project Failure</a></h1>
            <p><em>"The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." - John F. Kennedy</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-mortem Technique Introduction</strong> : Leo introduces the pre-mortem technique as a proactive strategy used to prevent failure in projects by analysing potential failure points ahead of project initiation. </li>
<li><strong>Conceptual Contrast</strong> : Pre-mortem is positioned in contrast to the post-mortem where analysis occurs post-project; pre-mortem involves envisioning and analyzing potential failure causes before a project starts. </li>
<li><strong>Including Psychological Factors</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the pre-mortem should encompass not just external factors but also internal psychological reasons for potential failure, such as self-sabotage. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Application of Pre-mortem</strong> : He encourages applying the pre-mortem to both professional projects and personal endeavors, citing examples like marriage, weight loss, starting a business, and finding life purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Visualizing Failure</strong> : The method involves vividly imagining the project failing entirely before commencement, then rigorously brainstorming and listing foreseeable causes of failure. </li>
<li><strong>Strategic Thinking Emphasis</strong> : Leo reminds viewers that the pre-mortem is part of strategic thinking, which should be employed in all important life endeavors, not just work-related projects. </li>
<li><strong>Listing Causes of Failure</strong> : After visualizing failure, one should create a detailed list of all possible causes of failure, prioritizing them from most threatening to least likely. </li>
<li><strong>Developing Solutions</strong> : For each potential failure point listed, especially the top three, specific and realistic solutions should be brainstormed to preemptively tackle these issues. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Introspection</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of personal introspection for identifying top potential causes of failure related to one's own weaknesses and psychological tendencies. </li>
<li><strong>Realistic Examples Given</strong> : Through the example of starting a new business, Leo provides a realistic set of potential failure reasons including economic downturns, being outperformed by competitors, personal habits like procrastination, technical skill gaps, and losing vision or motivation. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Perspective</strong> : Suggesting a holistic approach, Leo instructs to consider both internal and external factors, practical and subtle psychological causes when preparing the pre-mortem list. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-mortem Benefits</strong> : Leo asserts that the pre-mortem technique can provide a sobering perspective on what it will take to succeed, thereby increasing the chances of project success. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Psychological Weaknesses</strong> : Leo acknowledges his propensity for getting bored and losing focus, recognizing these traits as significant personal weaknesses that could potentially undermine his projects. </li>
<li><strong>Identifying Top Psychological Challenges</strong> : He advises isolating and prioritizing the top three personal psychological challenges or "inner demons," foreseeing how they might contribute to failure, particularly in business. </li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming Solutions</strong> : Leo suggests brainstorming realistic and practical solutions for each identified cause of failure, addressing potential distractions, accidental life changes like starting a family prematurely, burnout, financial insecurity fears, and self-doubt preventively. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem in Career Planning</strong> : He stresses the importance of applying the pre-mortem technique to one's entire career, not just individual projects. By considering future career failure and its potential psychological causes, one can proactively save their career. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Life Purpose</strong> : Leo highlights the use of the pre-mortem technique in assessing the potential failure of one's life purpose. Anticipating challenges that can affect achieving life goals is crucial. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Educational Goals</strong> : The technique is also useful for academic pursuits, such as planning for college, where pre-emptively addressing potential reasons for failure can influence academic success and prevent dropping out. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Weight Loss</strong> : He points out the effectiveness of pre-mortem in weight loss efforts by confronting psychological hurdles based on past failures and planning solutions for each challenge. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for General Life Planning</strong> : Leo encourages applying pre-mortem thinking to one's entire life, to envision and address factors that could lead to an overall life failure, focusing on psychological influences and personal weaknesses. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Spiritual Goals</strong> : For those seeking enlightenment or spiritual growth, pre-mortem can predict potential setbacks to spiritual endeavors and help in devising strategies to overcome them. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Hobbies and Relationships</strong> : Applying this strategy to new hobbies, relationships, or marriage can help identify psychological obstacles and create a plan to navigate these complex areas. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-Mortem for Travel and Annual Goals</strong> : Whether planning travel or setting annual goals, pre-mortem identifies reasons for potential failure, encourages proactive planning, and formulates solutions to prevent repeating past mistakes. </li>
<li><strong>Leo&#39;s Personal Examples of Pre-Mortem</strong> : Leo shares personal instances where the pre-mortem technique has been instrumental in significant life changes, such as moving cities and starting his platform, Actualized.org. </li>
<li><strong>Exercise and Worksheet Encouragement</strong> : He encourages us to apply the pre-mortem technique to a chosen life project using a free downloadable worksheet, emphasizing the importance of experiencing the satisfaction of strategic, proactive thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Balanced Strategic Thinking Importance</strong> : Leo warns against overanalysis and urges a balanced approach to strategic thinking that combines big-picture vision with attention to practical details, ensuring intuition and logic work in tandem. </li>
<li><strong>Continuous Personal Development</strong> : He concludes by inspiring viewers to invest in their self-growth through practical learning, which will result in greater life prospects and more effective strategies to overcome challenges and achieve goals.</li>
