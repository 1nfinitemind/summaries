            <ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Self-Esteem</strong> : Self-esteem is characterized by two key components: self-efficacy and self-respect. Self-efficacy reflects one's confidence to handle life's challenges and create a good life, while self-respect involves believing in one's inherent value and right to happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Efficacy Component</strong> : Self-efficacy pertains to the belief in one's capability to direct their life and solve problems. High self-efficacy signifies a sense of personal power and autonomy, whereas low self-efficacy is associated with feelings of victimhood and helplessness. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Respect Component</strong> : Self-respect is about valuing oneself and deserving happiness, good treatment, and refusal to settle for less. High self-respect indicates strong self-worth, whereas low self-respect can lead to being treated poorly by others. </li>
<li><strong>Quantifying Self-Esteem</strong> : To gauge self-esteem, Leo suggests ranking oneself on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of self-efficacy and self-respect, aiming for high scores for both to achieve optimal self-esteem. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Esteem as an Internal State</strong> : Self-esteem is determined by internal factors such as mindset, beliefs, and self-image, not external circumstances. Gaining control over one's life and cultivating a positive self-respect come from within. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing Low Self-Esteem</strong> : Acknowledging one's level of self-esteem is crucial for improvement. A rank of 4 or below suggests a self-esteem issue that needs to be addressed without self-blame but with the intention to work on it. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Esteem Fluctuations</strong> : Self-esteem levels change over time and should be assessed on an average basis, rather than at singular low moments. Occasional dips in self-esteem are normal. </li>
<li><strong>Causes of Low Self-Esteem</strong> : The primary cause of low self-esteem is a negative self-image, often stemming from childhood experiences or traumatic events that lead to subconscious beliefs about oneself. These beliefs can limit one's potential and happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Unconscious Self-Image</strong> : Our self-perception, including strengths and weaknesses, consists of unconscious beliefs that can significantly limit our capabilities and potential. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of Negative Beliefs</strong> : Negative views about oneself, such as being unintelligent, unattractive, clumsy, or unworthy of love, are often deeply ingrained in one's self-image, largely stemming from childhood experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Origin of Limiting Beliefs</strong> : Limiting beliefs can be traced back to childhood, from age 3 to 12, when individuals are highly impressionable and negative remarks or unstable family environments can leave lasting detrimental impressions. </li>
<li><strong>Uncovering Self-Esteem Issues Through Journaling</strong> : Leo suggests using journaling as a method to retrospectively analyze one&#39;s life, understand the roots of low self-esteem, and develop awareness that can lead to personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Malleability of Self-Image</strong> : Emphasizes that self-image, although impactful, is not fixed and that personal development can lead to positive changes and increased self-esteem. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Development for Self-Esteem</strong> : Engaging in deep inner work, seeking therapy, coaching, and consuming resources like books and seminars are vital actions in the journey to enhancing self-esteem.</li>
