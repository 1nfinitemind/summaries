            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of Self–Esteem</b>: Self–esteem is characterized by two key components: self–efficacy and self–respect. Self–efficacy reflects one's confidence to handle life's challenges and create a good life, while self–respect involves believing in one's inherent value and right to happiness.
</li><li><b>Self–Efficacy Component</b>: Self–efficacy pertains to the belief in one's capability to direct their life and solve problems. High self–efficacy signifies a sense of personal power and autonomy, whereas low self–efficacy is associated with feelings of victimhood and helplessness.
</li><li><b>Self–Respect Component</b>: Self–respect is about valuing oneself and deserving happiness, good treatment, and refusal to settle for less. High self–respect indicates strong self–worth, whereas low self–respect can lead to being treated poorly by others.
</li><li><b>Quantifying Self–Esteem</b>: To gauge self–esteem, Leo suggests ranking oneself on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of self–efficacy and self–respect, aiming for high scores for both to achieve optimal self–esteem.
</li><li><b>Self–Esteem as an Internal State</b>: Self–esteem is determined by internal factors such as mindset, beliefs, and self–image, not external circumstances. Gaining control over one's life and cultivating a positive self–respect come from within.
</li><li><b>Recognizing Low Self–Esteem</b>: Acknowledging one's level of self–esteem is crucial for improvement. A rank of 4 or below suggests a self–esteem issue that needs to be addressed without self–blame but with the intention to work on it.
</li><li><b>Self–Esteem Fluctuations</b>: Self–esteem levels change over time and should be assessed on an average basis, rather than at singular low moments. Occasional dips in self–esteem are normal.
</li><li><b>Causes of Low Self–Esteem</b>: The primary cause of low self–esteem is a negative self–image, often stemming from childhood experiences or traumatic events that lead to subconscious beliefs about oneself. These beliefs can limit one's potential and happiness.
</li><li><b>Unconscious Self–Image</b>: Our self–perception, including strengths and weaknesses, consists of unconscious beliefs that can significantly limit our capabilities and potential.
</li><li><b>Nature of Negative Beliefs</b>: Negative views about oneself, such as being unintelligent, unattractive, clumsy, or unworthy of love, are often deeply ingrained in one's self–image, largely stemming from childhood experiences.
</li><li><b>Origin of Limiting Beliefs</b>: Limiting beliefs can be traced back to childhood, from age 3 to 12, when individuals are highly impressionable and negative remarks or unstable family environments can leave lasting detrimental impressions.
</li><li><b>Uncovering Self–Esteem Issues Through Journaling</b>: Leo suggests using journaling as a method to retrospectively analyze one's life, understand the roots of low self–esteem, and develop awareness that can lead to personal growth.
</li><li><b>Malleability of Self–Image</b>: Emphasizes that self–image, although impactful, is not fixed and that personal development can lead to positive changes and increased self–esteem.
</li><li><b>Personal Development for Self–Esteem</b>: Engaging in deep inner work, seeking therapy, coaching, and consuming resources like books and seminars are vital actions in the journey to enhancing self–esteem.
