            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/qy_INVm_Pw0' target='_blank'>Awareness Alone Is Curative - How To Auto-Correct Unwanted Behaviors</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Awareness as a Path to Changing Unhealthy Behaviors</b>: Leo Gura describes how awareness, rather than willpower or forced action, can naturally correct unwanted behaviors. By simply observing these behaviors without judgment, the individual can allow them to dissolve over time.
</li><li><b>The Principle of Awareness Over Action</b>: Leo explains that neurotic patterns of behavior come from a conflict between the desire to change and the resistance to change. He suggests a reframe of this dynamic by introducing the principle that "awareness alone is curative," meaning observation without action can lead to change.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Trusting the Awareness Method</b>: Instead of actively seeking solutions to problems like overeating or lack of confidence, Leo advocates for shining awareness on the issue. The trust is in the power of awareness to naturally dissolve the problem without needing to force change.
</li><li><b>Autocorrection through Observation</b>: The idea is that any unhealthy behavior will auto–correct merely through observation. Full consciousness is cited as being unable to coexist with an unhealthy behavior. This principle is credited to being learned from Bill Harris of Centrepointe.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Maintaining Constant Awareness</b>: Leo acknowledges that for awareness to be effective, it must be constant and sustained throughout the entire behavior, which can be challenging in terms of patience and consistency.
</li><li><b>Practical Application with Junk Food</b>: Leo gives a practical example of how to apply awareness to the habit of eating junk food. Instead of restricting oneself through guilt or willpower, he suggests fully engaging in the process of ordering and consuming the food, but with complete awareness of every aspect and consequence.
</li><li><b>Non–judgmental Observation</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of observing the behavior and its effects, such as feelings of nausea or bloating after overeating, without any judgments or moral self–criticism. Simply observing the entire experience silently and mindfully.
</li><li><b>Observation of Daily Life</b>: By observing without judgment all aspects of daily life, from waking up feeling unwell to noticing physical imperfections like a gut sticking out, awareness becomes a natural part of one's routine.
</li><li><b>Natural Results of Ongoing Awareness</b>: Consistent observation of oneself and the behaviors that cause personal suffering can result in a natural inclination to avoid those behaviors without the need for force or guilt, such as declining greasy food without effort.
</li><li><b>Unconsciousness and Unwanted Behaviors</b>: Engaging in unwanted behaviors, such as binge–watching TV while eating ice cream, occurs because awareness is deliberately distracted or surrendered, allowing these behaviors to take place with little resistance.
</li><li><b>Awareness vs Logical Knowing</b>: People often confuse logical knowing, such as knowing smoking is bad, with awareness. Awareness is an in–the–moment observation that is different from stored knowledge or logical understanding.
</li><li><b>Awareness Muscle Development</b>: Awareness is likened to a muscle that needs consistent exercise to remain strong. Losing awareness is compared to a muscle going unused, resulting in unconscious behavior.
</li><li><b>Awareness as Observation</b>: True observation, or awareness, involves passively noticing everything, akin to a scientist studying birds, without any moral judgments or attempts to control the situation.
</li><li><b>Moralizing Is Not Awareness</b>: Moralizing, such as judging one's own eating habits, is a behavior to be observed and released through awareness, not by moralizing further.
</li><li><b>Releasing Control for Awareness</b>: Ego–driven behavior is akin to micromanaging and needs to be released in favor of passive awareness, which operates on a deeper level than conscious desire.
</li><li><b>Awareness Is Not Suppression</b>: Leo clarifies that awareness practice does not involve suppressing desires but rather involves being fully conscious of the desires and actions without trying to manipulate them.
</li><li><b>Passive Practice of Awareness</b>: The practice of awareness is passive and scientific, like a scientist recording observations without interfering. This requires trust in the effectiveness of consistent application.
</li><li><b>Versatile Application of Awareness</b>: Awareness can effectively address a wide range of unwanted behaviors, from overeating to psychological issues like shyness, depression, and anxiety.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Shyness Through Awareness</b>: An example application is for overcoming shyness–by observing one's thoughts, physical reactions, and surrounding environment, it's predicted that shyness will naturally subside with consistent awareness practice.
</li><li><b>Awareness in Handling Depression</b>: Leo advises to practice full awareness during periods of depression, acknowledging thoughts and feelings without trying to escape or change them. With patience and consistency, one can become conscious of how they perpetuate their own depression, ultimately leading the depression to become 'impossible.'
</li><li><b>Dealing with Fear Through Awareness</b>: Leo suggests confronting fears, such as the fear of children using drugs, by observing the fear itself. Full awareness of the thoughts and images that accompany the fear can, over time, lead to a natural resolution of the problem, removing the need for forceful action.
</li><li><b>Thoughts and the Belief Network</b>: Leo describes the mind as a vast network of thoughts and beliefs that constantly trigger each other, shaping one's personality and actions. This complex system is self–sustaining, aimed at maintaining homeostasis, and challenging to change from within.
</li><li><b>Awareness and Systems Change</b>: Leo highlights that awareness is the key to deep systemic change; trying to change beliefs with other beliefs is likely to fail. As awareness is cultivated, the network of beliefs restructures itself naturally, leading to genuine transformation.
</li><li><b>Leveraging Awareness for Change Over Force</b>: According to Leo, using force to change one's network of beliefs is a self–defeating approach, as the force is generated from within the same belief system. True, effortless change occurs as a natural byproduct of raised awareness, not through exerted force.
</li><li><b>Conceptually Accepting External Forces and Surrendering</b>: One must conceptually understand that forces outside of one's control exist, and surrendering to these forces can be a powerful catalyst for change, facilitated by an acceptance that emerges from within one's belief system.
</li><li><b>Practical Steps to Develop Awareness</b>: Leo advocates creating a daily meditation habit as an effective way to strengthen the 'awareness muscle.' This, coupled with absorbing the right concepts about the nature of awareness and reality, can lead to profound improvements in overcoming life's challenges.
</li><li><b>Transformation Through Awareness and Truth</b>: All real change aligns with reality and truth, achievable through the development of awareness. Persistent practice of awareness can lead to a significant transformation in one's experience of life, resolving long–standing issues.
