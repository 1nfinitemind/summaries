        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2u5M6tDc5TE' target='_blank'>State Of Consciousness Is Everything</a></h1>
        <p><em>State is EVERYTHING</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Pillar of Understanding Consciousness</strong> : Leo Gura discusses the central idea of his teachings&mdash;that state of consciousness is everything. He insists nothing exists outside of states of consciousness, including all physical objects and experiences, which he asserts are figments within different states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as States of Consciousness</strong> : The materialistic notion that consciousness is a byproduct of physical objects is challenged. Leo argues that reality consists solely of consciousness, which takes on various states. This view substantially diverges from traditional materialistic paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Nature of Consciousness</strong> : Leo rejects the categorization of states of consciousness, arguing that there are an infinite number of states, which can flow and change fluidly rather than switching on and off like binary states. </li>
<li><strong>Introduction to Figments of Consciousness</strong> : States of consciousness are made up of 'figments'. Instead of viewing reality as composed of atoms or as a simulation, Leo puts forth the idea that reality is comprised of figments held within consciousness, comparable to elements within a dream. </li>
<li><strong>Physical Objects as Figments</strong> : Using the example of a Snickers candy bar, Gura argues that objects we perceive in reality are not reducible to atoms or molecular structures but exist wholesomely as figments within consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as Absolute and Ungrounded</strong> : Leo conveys that consciousness does not require grounding in a physical nervous system, body, neural network, computer simulation, or universe. Instead, consciousness is presented as pure and absolute, containing all experiences within it, including the material universe. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as the Fabric of Reality</strong> : Leo Gura explains that both our idea of the physical universe and the physical universe itself are figments of consciousness. The room you're in and everything within it, including complex entities like Albert Einstein, are not built bottom-up from atoms but are woven figments of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Inclusivity of the Figment Concept</strong> : Various items, concepts, and experiences, ranging from physical objects like gasoline and braces to abstract ideas like Bitcoin and even historical figures like Albert Einstein, are all figments of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Non-materialistic View of Consciousness</strong> : Leo criticizes the materialistic paradigm of reality being constructed from the bottom up, advocating instead that consciousness creates reality in a top-down manner, holding figments within without the necessity for foundational material elements. </li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Interconnection in Consciousness</strong> : The complexity and interconnection of figments are underscored by the ability of consciousness to infinitely nest and weave together these figments, creating complex constructs like a human being or an entire city. </li>
<li><strong>Fundamentality of Figments in Consciousness</strong> : Emphasizing the radical shift required to understand consciousness, Leo argues that no figment is more fundamental than another, with reality capable of creating anything, from a mosquito bite to the concept of capitalism, directly as figments of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Limitlessness of Figment Creation</strong> : Consciousness has no boundaries in creating figments, which includes breaking down or magnifying into infinite sub-figments, akin to an endless fractal zoom, demonstrating the concept of infinite consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Direct Experience of Consciousness</strong> : Leo encourages direct observation to understand that everything, from used condoms to entire cities and emotions, are figments of consciousness. This approach does not rely on belief systems or scientific verification, but rather direct conscious realization. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of the building blocks of reality</strong> : Leo Gura underlines that from the perspective of consciousness, no single 'building block' of reality is more fundamental or plausible than another. An electron and an abstract entity like a pina colada or a joke are all considered equal in complexity as figments of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding of complexity in figments</strong> : He argues that the human notion that some things are more 'natural' for reality to create is a misconception. Complexities of an electron and a pina colada are identical, as both can be infinitely zoomed into and analyzed. This illustrates that from reality's perspective, everything is equally plausible to create. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as the fundamental fabric</strong> : Leo reiterates that attempts to find a non-figment substrate of reality are misguided, since any posited substrate, whether an electron, a string, or the notion of a computer simulation, is ultimately another figment of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Life as a tapestry of figments</strong> : Leo invites the audience to consider their entire lives, including memories, birth, death, and even times of unconsciousness, as a single figment of consciousness woven from strands of smaller figments. </li>
<li><strong>Material objects as figments</strong> : He emphasizes the exercise of grasping that all material objects, demonstrated through the example of a smartphone, are not made up of matter but are entire pieces of consciousness which are holistic and qualitative. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the infinite nature of figments</strong> : Consciousness is described as infinite and scale-invariant, not limited to any specific shape, size, or complexity. The scale is a concept created by comparing various figments within consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>The fallacy of seeking concrete reality</strong> : Leo challenges the idea that at a fundamental level, reality is concrete or discrete, emphasizing that concreteness itself is a figment of consciousness, and reality could be abstract, vague, or unspecified. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as irreducible</strong> : He demarcates that consciousness cannot be reduced further since it is the ultimate constituent of all figments. Consciousness is defined broadly as infinity, encompassing all possible figments and is equivalent to pure emptiness. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as woven figments for sanity</strong> : To maintain a coherent sense of sanity, reality is intricately woven together by consciousness using figments from the top down, revealing the challenge of understanding consciousness while retaining sanity. </li>
<li><strong>Sanity as a barrier to understanding consciousness</strong> : Leo proposes that trying to understand consciousness might require one to risk their 'sanity', given the radical shift in perspective needed to grasp the true nature of consciousness and reality. </li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation of Dreamlike and Material Reality</strong> : Leo questions why reality feels so solid, contemplating why walls feel tangible if they are figments of consciousness. He suggests that realizing the dreamlike nature of reality might feel like insanity, as it threatens our understanding of physicality and sanity. </li>
<li><strong>Sanity and Material Reality</strong> : Leo intimates that sanity is intertwined with physical reality; to experience non-physical reality, one might feel insane. The more non-physical reality is perceived, the less physical it seems, challenging our definition of sanity. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of Losing Physical Reality</strong> : He highlights the fear and confusion that would result from losing a sense of physical reality. The potential to walk through walls or for hands to pass through people might impress upon someone that they're going insane, disrupting their ability to lead a normal life. </li>
<li><strong>Survival within the Dream</strong> : Leo plays with the idea that our survival and daily functioning depend on the coherence and stability of the dreamlike state into which we are born. Anything that shakes the foundation of this dream creates fear because it threatens our perceived ability to survive. </li>
<li><strong>Quest for Normalcy Amidst Unraveling Reality</strong> : When faced with inconsistencies in what we perceive as material reality, humans seek to re-establish their baseline state of consciousness. They seek medical help and reassurance to revert back to their previous state, highlighting society's dependence on a coherent, shared sense of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Material Reality as a Coherent Dream</strong> : The solidity and consistency of material reality are attributed to a coherent collection of figments of consciousness. When this coherence unravels, it induces a sense of insanity and the impulse to restore the original 'dream'. </li>
<li><strong>Everything as figments within consciousness</strong> : Leo insists that experiences and objects like walls, brains, and even material reality are not outside consciousness but are absolute figments within it. This perspective challenges the traditional view of reality as material and separate from the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Consciousness through Awakening</strong> : To truly understand consciousness, Leo suggests that one must awaken to the interconnectedness and fluidity of all figments, unraveling them like yarn in a sweater. This shift allows for the realization that reality is infinitely continuous and made of the same 'yarn' or substance. </li>
<li><strong>Mind vs. Material</strong> : He distinguishes mind from material, noting that the mind is holistic and top-down, with the capacity for intelligence and sentience. In contrast, the material is limited to its smallest parts and works bottom-up, precluding intelligence. </li>
<li><strong>Features of Mind</strong> : Mind has distinct capabilities such as creativity, remembrance, forgetfulness, lacks a substrate or ground due to its infinite nature, and possesses will. This sets it apart from material systems, which require a substrate and cannot exhibit will or consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Mind and Matter</strong> : The relationship between mind and matter is such that mind can create the illusion of matter, but matter cannot generate mind. Matter, as perceived in reality, is a dumbed-down version of mind designed to appear finite. </li>
<li><strong>Material Systems as Infinite</strong> : Leo Gura asserts that, upon close examination, finite material systems are actually infinite systems "dumbed down" from the top-down to give the illusion of being limited and finite. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Field of Consciousness</strong> : Consciousness can be thought of as an infinite field of infinitely divisible and communicative 'voxels' or pixels that coordinate intelligently from the top-down. This field lacks any smallest resolution unit, shape, or boundary, making every 'voxel' boundlessly dynamic. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of voxels</strong> : To better illustrate consciousness, Gura uses the term 'voxels' instead of pixels as they can exist in more than three dimensions, are unbounded, and represent an infinitely subdividable field of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Intelligence in Consciousness</strong> : Intelligence is defined as the ability of these infinitely subdivided and coordinated subdivisions of consciousness to communicate and manifest as our physical reality, such as a human hand. </li>
<li><strong>Remembrance and Forgetfulness in Consciousness</strong> : Consciousness can selectively remember or forget aspects of itself, a capacity material systems cannot emulate. Adjusting the level of remembrance and forgetfulness is akin to the process of awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Limits of Conceptual Thinking</strong> : Conceptual thinking, modeling, and logic are insufficient to replace or replicate direct states of consciousness. They are constrained within the frame of the current state of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Hyper Thinking</strong> : A higher state of consciousness allows for hyper thinking, which provides a multidimensional and higher bandwidth intelligence that can think and interconnect complex ideas, similar to a highly evolved alien intelligence. Such hyper thinking transcends normal human cognitive abilities. </li>
<li><strong>Communication Limitations</strong> : Current human discourse and language lack the bandwidth to adequately convey or articulate experiences and concepts from higher states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Accessing Higher Intelligence</strong> : Gura explains that it is possible for individuals to experience and access the intelligence of a highly evolved, superintelligent entity, which he refers to as hyper thinking. This hyper-intelligent state allows for profoundly advanced cognitive processes beyond the scope of our regular state of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Hyper Thinking</strong> : Leo Gura introduces the concept of "hyper thinking," which transcends normal human thought by combining rationality, logic, mysticism, intuition, and spirituality. This advanced form of thinking helps cut through the constraints of ordinary thought, providing access to deeper spiritual truths that are not reachable through traditional meditation alone. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Mindfulness</strong> : Gura critiques certain practices like Zen Buddhism which emphasize silencing the mind, suggesting that while these can lead to awakenings, they fall short of achieving the level of understanding possible through hyper thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Memory and State of Consciousness</strong> : He illustrates the limitations of memory and understanding within our current state of consciousness by comparing it to an HD image reduced to a tiny and simplistic black-and-white version, indicating that profound insights from higher states lose much of their transformative potential when viewed from lower states. </li>
<li><strong>Expanding Consciousness Bandwidth</strong> : Leo emphasizes the goal of spiritual work is to expand the bandwidth and memory of our consciousness, which is necessary to retain and utilize insights from higher states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Parameters Defined by Consciousness</strong> : Gura explains that every state of consciousness sets the parameters for what we can think, feel, and perceive as logical or possible. To transcend these limitations, one must expand their state of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Possibilities in Higher States of Consciousness</strong> : He urges us to recognize radically new states of consciousness which are beyond our imaginations and suggests that at the highest states, there are no limitations, leading to "god mode" where nothing is impossible. </li>
<li><strong>Changing Consciousness States</strong> : The most crucial change one can implement is altering their state of consciousness, both in temporary peaks and permanent baseline changes. While peak experiences offer profound insights, changing the baseline state is essential for lasting transformation. </li>
<li><strong>Science and Consciousness</strong> : Leo asserts that science, birth, death, skepticism, and even rationality occur within certain states of consciousness, indicating that these elements are relative and not indicative of higher truths. </li>
<li><strong>Equivalence of States of Consciousness</strong> : He proclaims all states of consciousness have their value and warns that higher states may not be conducive for those wishing to maintain their sanity and engage with human life. </li>
<li><strong>Accessing Higher States of Consciousness</strong> : Most misunderstandings about spirituality, religion, and reality stem from the inability to access high mystical states of consciousness through traditional intellectual efforts. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of Religious Teachings</strong> : Gura laments that society and culture tend to degrade religious teachings due to translating them from higher states of consciousness down to lower levels, making them difficult to grasp fully within an ordinary state of awareness. </li>
<li><strong>State of Consciousness and Understanding</strong> : Leo highlights the difficulty many people have in making sense of spiritual concepts without accessing higher states of consciousness. They remain confused and lost, hindered by ideologies and models that would collapse if higher states were accessed. </li>
<li><strong>Defense Mechanisms Against Higher Consciousness</strong> : Gura notes that people have defense mechanisms preventing them from accessing higher states of consciousness, which could lead to the collapse of their current belief systems and the sensation of losing their minds. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Changing Baseline Consciousness</strong> : Emphasizes the importance of changing one's baseline state of consciousness, despite the fear, difficulty, and potential danger involved. This change is rare, marking society's ignorance and signifying we're living in a 'dark age'. </li>
<li><strong>Isolation in Higher States of Consciousness</strong> : Explores the loneliness of reaching higher states of consciousness due to a lack of understanding and connection with others, also noting that at the very highest levels, it feels like there's no one else to validate or share the insights with. </li>
<li><strong>Methods to Change State of Consciousness</strong> : Lists various methods to change states of consciousness, emphasizing the necessity of deep concentration, prolonged practice, and intensity for significant shifts. Techniques include meditation, yoga, chanting, deep breathing, psychedelics, and extreme experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Raising Baseline Consciousness</strong> : Mentions the challenge of permanently raising one's baseline state of consciousness compared to accessing peak states, stating that raising the baseline requires intensive work. </li>
<li><strong>Capabilities from Higher States of Consciousness</strong> : Explains that mystics and enlightened individuals may display paranormal abilities due to being in higher states of consciousness, which seem impossible from lower states. </li>
<li><strong>Varied States and Awakening</strong> : Discusses how each being inhabits a unique state of consciousness, with God being all states but only self-aware from higher or awakened states. Enlightenment can be temporary or permanent with varying degrees. </li>
<li><strong>Discrepancies in Spiritual Teachings</strong> : Attributes disagreements between spiritual teachings to differences in states of consciousness accessed by their proponents. Challenges the notion that mystical teachings are irrational, suggesting that disbelief indicates lower states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite and Unbounded Consciousness</strong> : States that consciousness is infinite, unbounded, and the foundation of all realities. It has no origin as concepts of 'where' and 'coming from' are within consciousness, making it eternal and always present. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of God in Consciousness</strong> : God is not just a figment of consciousness but rather is consciousness itself, encompassing all possible figments and existing at a meta level. </li>
<li><strong>Human Identity as a Figment</strong> : The biographical, biological self that one identifies with is a figment of consciousness, one of many that we, as manifestations of godly consciousness, dream up. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Evolving Understanding</strong> : Despite understanding consciousness at a very high level, Leo acknowledges that his grasp on the nuances, mechanics, and details of consciousness continues to evolve. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge in Articulating Consciousness</strong> : Leo distinguishes accessing higher states of consciousness from the challenge of articulating, modeling, and explaining them to others. </li>
<li><strong>Struggle with Embodiment</strong> : Even with his experience of high levels of consciousness, Leo admits that he struggles with embodying these insights in daily life, indicating years of work remain. </li>
<li><strong>Awareness of Self-Deception</strong> : Leo is highly self-aware regarding the potential for self-deception and stresses the importance of constant self-scrutiny. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and Teaching Limitations</strong> : Leo conveys the responsibility he feels in teaching about consciousness, as well as acknowledging the limitations and biases inherent in his teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Imperfection and Growth</strong> : He urges listeners to take responsibility for their personal spiritual journey and not to see him or anyone as infallible, emphasizing continuous personal growth and learning. </li>
<li><strong>Spirituality as Personal Responsibility</strong> : Leo encourages listeners to embrace spirituality as a deeply personal endeavor that cannot be outsourced and to actively engage in their spiritual growth rather than passively accepting teachings.</li>
