            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yhfeLiuG_wo' target='_blank'>Leaving On 30-Day Solo Retreat</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Reason for Taking a Break</b>: Leo is pausing Actualized.org to undertake a personal 30–day meditation retreat to reassess things afterward, due to the intensive nature of video creation and his desire to focus on personal growth.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Content Creation</b>: Leo finds creating increasingly complex and nuanced videos laborious and it limits his time for personal development and consciousness work.
</li><li><b>Balancing Act Between Teaching and Practicing</b>: There is a delicate balance between conducting research, formulating ideas, and personally embodying the teachings discussed in Actualized.org content.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Embodiment</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for more solitude to deeply contemplate and meditate, to embody the more advanced topics he covers.
</li><li><b>Plan for the 30–Day Retreat</b>: Leo intends to conduct a silent retreat alone, focusing on meditation and self–observation, to facilitate significant personal awakening experiences.
</li><li><b>Experience Since Previous Retreat</b>: Since his last retreat in May, Leo mentions his growth, quieting of the monkey mind, and plans to build upon these past insights and breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>Future Release Schedule</b>: Expected changes to Actualized.org's video releasing frequency, with a potential shift towards less regular, but more quality–driven and impactful content.
</li><li><b>Evolution of Priorities</b>: Leo's growing disinterest in subscriber counts and views, focusing instead on deeper work and original research for mankind's progress.
</li><li><b>Preparations and Mindfulness</b>: Plans for complete digital disconnection, avoiding all media and work, maintaining mindfulness during routine activities such as grocery shopping.
</li><li><b>Anticipation of Retreat Outcomes</b>: Leo shares a mix of excitement and expectation of suffering, but looks forward to the insights and personal readiness for deeper spiritual embodiment.
</li><li><b>Feeling of Transitional Phase</b>: A sense of completing a chapter with Actualized.org and a readiness to move into a new stage of personal and professional evolution.
</li><li><b>Conclusion about Content Creation</b>: Leo assures that despite his inward focus, he will continue the Actualized.org series with more content after his retreat.
</li><li><b>Closing and Evolving Chapters</b>: Leo expresses that although Actualized.org has been a long–running project, there's a natural time for closing chapters and beginning new ones in life. He's not leaving Actualized.org but envisions a rebirth, moving into a more spiritual chapter of growth.
</li><li><b>Next Stage of Life – Enlightenment Chapter</b>: Transitioning from a business and life–purpose chapter, Leo aims to enter an enlightenment chapter. He wants to evolve his level of consciousness and bring his audience along, potentially changing his content delivery format.
</li><li><b>Potential Changes in Content Delivery</b>: Leo hints at more in–person teachings or doing a tour, as well as possibly working on a book. He is open to allowing the direction of his work to unfold organically based on insights gained in his upcoming retreat.
</li><li><b>Content Creation Evolution</b>: Leo describes his new content creation method, a multi–threaded approach, where he simultaneously adds ideas to 150 video outlines instead of focusing on one. This process allows connections across various topics, offering a holistic view.
</li><li><b>Constant Search for Innovation</b>: Leo needs constant newness and innovation in his life, viewing it as essential for being engaged with life. He can't be content with repetitive success but seeks to push the boundaries in spirituality, science, and philosophy.
</li><li><b>Interconnecting Modern Insights with Spirituality</b>: Leo emphasizes the integration of spiritual insights with modern scientific discoveries, pointing out that he is very much pro–science when used correctly to make advancements in spirituality, psychology, and government.
</li><li><b>Holistic and Integrated Approach Needed</b>: He argues that society needs a broad, integral approach to spirituality and human development that goes beyond fixed sets of teachings. This means including modern knowledge and technology to address the evolving complexities of society.
</li><li><b>Intellectual Foundations for Global Awakening</b>: Before technological advances, Leo sees the need for an intellectual foundation to help humanity awaken to new possibilities. Actualized.org aims to provide the intellectual infrastructure that supports this intellectual revolution.
</li><li><b>New Enlightenment Beyond Established Systems</b>: Leo calls for a new enlightenment that incorporates scientific, philosophical, and spiritual insights, going beyond established religious and spiritual doctrines and transforming education, government, and other institutions.
</li><li><b>Continuous Learning and Evolving</b>: Leo stresses that humanity is just beginning the awakening process, and the work needed spans physical, technological, and intellectual development, with the potential for evolution continuing indefinitely.
</li><li><b>Critique of Traditional Spiritual Practices</b>: Leo criticizes ancient spiritual traditions, including Hinduism and others, for being outdated and lacking integration with modern disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology which are essential for addressing psychological issues encountered in spiritual practice.
</li><li><b>Need for Integrating Diverse Fields</b>: Leo advocates for an integration of non–duality with all spiritual traditions and religions globally, combining them with advancements in science, social sciences, technology, philosophy, and self–help movements, to build a holistic understanding of life.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Existing Spiritual Systems</b>: He points out that spiritual schools are often disconnected from contemporary knowledge and justify the exclusion of other fields like psychology, which hinders the progress towards a more integrated spirituality that addresses all aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Vision for Society–Wide Transformation</b>: Leo argues for a comprehensive reform involving the sciences, culture, nutrition, education, and technology, suggesting that an interdisciplinary approach is needed to realize his vision of an awakened society.
</li><li><b>Personal Development as a Foundation for Reform</b>: Emphasizing the importance of personal growth, Leo discusses his own health and the necessity of internal work to effectively contribute to social transformation and prevent the spread of dogmatic and rigid systems.
</li><li><b>Self–discipline in Achieving Vision</b>: He stresses the importance of self–purification and awareness to avoid the temptations of power and influence that can lead to corruption, comparing this internal battle to the "devil within".
</li><li><b>Integration of Intellectual Frameworks with Spirituality</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for spiritual masters to go beyond self–mastery and incorporate intellectual structures into their teachings to influence cultural and societal evolution more effectively.
</li><li><b>Balancing Personal Development with Societal Impact</b>: Leo cautions against the potential trap of trying to awaken or change the world without sufficient self–development, maintaining that one can only lead others to the heights that one has personally achieved.
</li><li><b>Potential for Power to Corrupt</b>: He warns that with greater influence comes a greater risk of corruption and using power for selfish ends, which can undermine the original purpose of spiritual work and lead to rigid, dogmatic institutions.
</li><li><b>Future Commitment to Content Generation</b>: Leo assures that despite the focus on his personal journey, he intends to continue contributing to Actualized.org and further the goal of a widely integrative and evolving understanding of human development.
</li><li><b>Politicians' Downfalls Linked to Personal Indiscretions</b>: Leo cites the examples of John Edwards and Anthony Weiner, politicians whose promising careers were ruined due to their inability to control their sexual impulses. Edwards' career ended in scandal, while Weiner was imprisoned for illicit communication with a minor. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Not Controlling Selfish Desires</b>: Leo underscores the importance of self–control and warns that personal visions can be easily derailed by giving in to selfish impulses, which he metaphorically refers to as the "devil within."
</li><li><b>Role of Retreats in Preventing Self–Sabotage</b>: He advocates for retreats as a means of confronting and purifying oneself from internal wickedness and limitations. Retreats bring about conscious suffering, which differs from the unconscious suffering most people experience in their avoidance of growth. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of Comfort and Complacency</b>: Leo discusses the risks associated with becoming too comfortable and disconnected from suffering, as success can lead to a life of chasing pleasure, avoiding the necessary discomfort that facilitates growth.
</li><li><b>Seeking Conscious Suffering for Growth</b>: He advises deliberately placing oneself in challenging situations that lead to conscious suffering, which in turn promotes personal growth and aligns with the greater good.
</li><li><b>Life of Service versus Life of Pleasure</b>: Leo contrasts the unfulfilling life of indulgence in a materialistic world with the fulfilling sacrifices made when one chooses to serve a higher purpose.
</li><li><b>Becoming Vessels for a Greater Purpose</b>: Leo encourages becoming instruments for "Toyota's work," suggesting that individuals should purify their egos to allow themselves to be conduits for larger, impactful actions.
</li><li><b>Gandhi as an Exemplar of Purposeful Sacrifice</b>: He presents Gandhi's life as a testament to living in alignment with a noble cause, which included hardships and ultimate sacrifice but also immense fulfillment and societal impact.
</li><li><b>Challenges and Rewards of Transformative Living</b>: Leo acknowledges the risks faced by those who choose to drive societal change but stresses that the rewards of engaging with life on such an impactful level far outweigh the difficulties.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Continuing Actualized.org Content</b>: Leo concludes by reassuring his audience that despite his focus on inner work, Actualized.org will continue to offer content dedicated to personal and societal development.
