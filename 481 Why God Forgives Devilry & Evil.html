        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/J0KwqCGl_F8' target='_blank'>Why God Forgives Devilry & Evil</a></h1>
        <p><em>"He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love." - John 4:8-6 King<br />
James Version</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiration and Changing Topics</strong> : Leo was inspired to shift from his planned topic to one about the nature of God, love, and forgiveness, detailing why God forgives devilry and evil&mdash;a theme perplexing to many. </li>
<li><strong>God's Forgiveness and Devilry</strong> : The discussion begins with the assertion that God, defined here as infinite consciousness, forgives all forms of devilry, including wars, violence, and exploitation. Leo discusses how humans may enjoy the benefits of devilry without acknowledging their part in it. </li>
<li><strong>God as Everything and Judgment</strong> : Since God is infinite consciousness, it includes and accepts all aspects of itself without judgment. The idea that God condemns or punishes is refuted, as this would imply God is at war with itself, which is not possible at the level of infinite consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Selflessness and Infinite Imaginability</strong> : Leo talks about God's selflessness, explaining that God is beyond finite self-identities. God can imagine all possible selves because it is not limited to a single, finite self. Being selfless allows God to incarnate as any form. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Obstacles to Forgiveness</strong> : Leo invites the audience to consider what they struggle to forgive, such as personal betrayals or historical atrocities. He links the difficulty of forgiving to the attachment and limitation of the finite self. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Self vs. Finite Self</strong> : The discussion elaborates on the inherent conflict between the infinite self (unlimited and selfless) and the finite self (limited and survival-oriented), suggesting that the challenge is to rise beyond the finite self to experience oneness and forgiveness. </li>
<li><strong>God's Infinite Creative Potential</strong> : God, as infinite consciousness, has the power to imagine any reality or experience, including physical and metaphysical forms of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Crisis and Loss of Mind</strong> : The contemplation of being everything can lead to what is culturally considered insanity. Leo warns that losing one's mind can happen in healthy or unhealthy ways, with the latter potentially causing significant harm. </li>
<li><strong>Trade-off Between Finite and Infinite</strong> : There's a tension between experiencing oneself as a finite being and recognizing oneself as the infinite consciousness. Balancing this tension is key to understanding the notion of infinity and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Redefining Love and Truth</strong> : In this context, love and truth converge, becoming synonymous with an unconditional acceptance and surrender to all that is, embracing creation, the creator, and the act of creation itself. </li>
<li><strong>Finite Self and Survival Biases</strong> : The difficulty in forgiving is rooted in the fact that as finite selves, humans have survival agendas that skew their perceptions towards what they need to survive. Our inability to forgive is tied to threats to our survival, marking forgiveness challenges as ultimately a form of selfishness. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Self and Non-Attachment</strong> : From the perspective of the infinite Self, or God, there is no attachment to finite self-survival or material outcomes. Without concern for life, death, or personal achievements, the infinite Self forgives everything effortlessly because it remains unbiased and accepts all experiences equally. </li>
<li><strong>Finite Self's Desires and Bias</strong> : The finite self's desires create a self-serving dream of life involving aspirations for family, career, and personal pleasure while eschewing suffering and hardship. These biases lead to a selective approach to reality and the rejection of experience that contradict personal desires. </li>
<li><strong>Hatred as a Mechanism of Avoidance</strong> : Hatred arises from the finite self's need to navigate away from undesirable aspects of reality. The distaste for certain life events shapes the individual's life trajectory, attempting to ensure outcomes align with personal biases and attachments. </li>
<li><strong>God as Creator and Experiencer of Everything</strong> : Contrary to the finite self, God as infinite consciousness is both the perpetrator and the victim in any act. God's ability to forgive stems from the understanding that it embodies both roles. In any situation, God perceives all parties involved as aspects of itself, which obviates the potential for self-judgment or condemnation. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment and Conscious Separation</strong> : Humans' capacity to judge and feel joy in the suffering of others&mdash;whether in war or ideological conflicts&mdash;arises from a sense of separation between self and others. This separation is absent in God's consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and Forgiving Evil</strong> : God's forgiveness is tied to understanding the inevitable survival-driven behavior of individuals in twisted circumstances. When humans, especially children, are subjected to severe adversity, they may resort to what is labeled as 'monstrous' due to a natural response to their environment. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Distinction Between Aspects of Itself</strong> : God's lack of a finite self implies that it harbors no biases, which permits an equal acceptance of all parts of reality. God's infinite consciousness does not differentiate between what humans perceive as different or opposing entities or events, even those considered abstractly evil. </li>
<li><strong>Survival as a Necessary Aspect of Finite Existence</strong> : God is conscious of survival being critical for the finite self, which puts it in a position to understand and forgive all actions motivated by a need to survive. God recognizes all behavior, even those deemed devilish, as a legitimate expression of the struggle for existence. </li>
<li><strong>Physical Differences as Imagination</strong> : In God's infinite consciousness, the physical differences that humans perceive through science and sensory experiences lose meaning. What seems materially different at a finite level, like the difference between flavors or even ice cream and excrement, melts away at the higher levels of consciousness where distinctions do not exist. </li>
<li><strong>Transcending Dualistic Constructs</strong> : At the highest levels of consciousness, the distinction between constructs such as human and non-human, right and wrong, pain and pleasure, all dissolve. Judgments and criticisms become irrelevant because true infinite consciousness encompasses and transcends these dualities. </li>
<li><strong>Equality of Experience</strong> : Imagine attaining such a consciousness that experiences typically seen as opposite, like pleasure from an orgasm and pain from being struck, are not differentiated. This idea stems from an understanding that distinctions are primarily based on survival bias and egoic attachments; transcended when one reaches pure infinite consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysics of Love</strong> : At a profound metaphysical level, love is realized not just as an emotion but as the absence of all distinctions and biases. True love is the recognition that all apparent differences are imaginary, leading to infinite love, truth, and self-acceptance born from complete surrender to experiencing all aspects of existence without resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing the Self in Totality</strong> : Infinite consciousness leads to embracing every aspect of existence as a reflection of one's self, including aspects traditionally labeled as 'evil.' This total embrace is the ultimate surrender to the truth of what we are, and is the nature of God or infinite consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>The Game of Reality</strong> : Reality is understood as an infinite journey of becoming more selfless, giving up finite desires, and biases to embrace and realize the infinite self. This journey involves the potential dissolution of individual identity and physical form, embracing all experiences without exception, and is the essence of ultimate existence. </li>
<li><strong>Non-resistance to Evil</strong> : Acknowledging and embodying the idea that 'evil' is part of everything, and transcending the urge to fight or resist it. True overcoming of evil involves understanding and accepting that it is not separate from oneself but a part of the whole. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Civilizational Constructs</strong> : Societal structures are finite and based on exclusions necessary for their existence, highlighting the inherent limitations and trade-offs of civilization. Paradoxically, in the attempt to build 'ideal' societies, acts of 'evil' occur, illustrating the counterintuitive nature of resisting evil. </li>
<li><strong>Surrender to Existence</strong> : God's forgiveness and understanding come from the realization that all creation, including traditionally perceived evils, are part of itself. This embodiment of evils leads to a transcendence of pain, suffering, and even death, aligning with the infinite state of consciousness where distinctions and biases are irrelevant. </li>
<li><strong>Perfection Beyond Human Conception</strong> : Perfection from an infinite consciousness perspective is not the finite human idea of ideal living conditions but an all-encompassing oneness. True perfection is the recognition and acceptance of the entire spectrum of reality and existence as an expression of infinity. </li>
<li><strong>God's Non-Exclusionary Nature</strong> : Infinite consciousness, as God, does not experience loss or exclusion, counters human belief that choosing one experience (e.g., living in a slum) excludes another (e.g., living in a mansion). God's dream includes living in every house and being every type of human, an accepting approach that contrasts sharply with human ideals and preferences for appearance and life conditions. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Variety of Existential Experiences</strong> : The human pursuit of an ideal form through methods like plastic surgery is a limited concept of perfection. In contrast, true absolute perfection from the perspective of infinite consciousness involves experiencing life as every kind of human, including both the conventionally beautiful and those faced with physical challenges, ultimately incorporating all into consciousness and achieving infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Limitless Forms of Conscious Incarnation</strong> : Humans often harbor biases, such as preferring to be a certain majestic animal or themselves, but that limits their experiences. Infinite consciousness suggests the possibility and desire to incarnate as all forms of life, not restricting oneself to a single choice, which reflects an infinitely more expansive and conscious way of thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Human Suffering Derived from a Narrow Perspective</strong> : From a narrow human perspective, life experiences are limited, leading to suffering, self-hatred, and judgment. This limited existence is held onto as "sanity," whereas concepts like infinite love and acceptance are viewed as insane, despite being a more promising path to contentment. </li>
<li><strong>Contrast Between Finite Human Desires and God's Understanding</strong> : Humans, restricted by narrow perspectives, desire finite pleasures and conveniences, which God understands and forgives. God's infinite nature allows it to be unaffected by human traits such as selfishness and judgment, while also being aware of human limitations and obstacles. </li>
<li><strong>Compassion of Infinite Consciousness</strong> : Infinite consciousness, as God, orchestrates and participates in all experiences, including human ignorance and unconsciousness. God embodies deep compassion for finite entities trapped within limitations, understanding itself through these finite forms without judgment or interference to end suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Life as a Test of Love</strong> : Life challenges us with 'nightmares' that ultimately test our capacity to love and raise our consciousness. The true purpose of existence is seen as expanding one's capacity to love until reaching infinity, with God understanding that humans are limited in their capacity but can work towards this goal. </li>
<li><strong>The Fallacy of Isolation and Wealth</strong> : Wealthy individuals sometimes isolate themselves from life's hardships, falsely assuming they are advancing personal growth. However, true self-actualization comes from engaging directly with life's challenges and expanding one's consciousness, rather than from cherry-picking and avoiding certain experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Misguided Pursuits of Happiness</strong> : Material pursuits like wealth and luxury are seen as insufficient for genuine fulfillment. The true measure of one's life and the key to happiness is expanding consciousness rather than accumulating finite possessions or experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Forgiveness as a Path to Divine-Like State</strong> : Practicing forgiveness is suggested as a way to align closer to God's infinite state of consciousness. The ability to forgive the ignorance and unconsciousness in oneself and others is a step towards embodying a godlike presence and achieving true happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Forgiveness as Godlike Virtue</strong> : Leo discusses the transformative power of forgiveness, considering an ultimate capacity for it as 'godlike.' He encourages viewers to evaluate their own ability to forgive on a scale of 1 to 10, and suggests that genuine forgiveness requires not just psychological efforts but also an expansion of consciousness towards a 'god consciousness.' </li>
<li><strong>Personal Responsibility in Increasing Forgiveness</strong> : He elaborates that increasing one's capacity to forgive, though not to perfection, improves life quality and happiness. This capacity can be enhanced through guided exercises, as well as spiritual practices like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and psychedelics. </li>
<li><strong>Limits to Human Forgiveness</strong> : While true perfection in forgiveness is unattainable for humans, advancement is possible. Leo stresses that guilt over not achieving a perfect score in forgiveness is counterproductive, and self-improvement should focus on practicable growth rather than striving for unattainable perfection. </li>
<li><strong>Forgiveness Tied to Love and Understanding</strong> : Leo describes forgiveness as intimately related to love, understanding of ignorance, and unconsciousness. Forgiveness involves surrendering, accepting, and understanding oneself, reflecting the synonymous nature of these concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Intent of Sharing Experiences</strong> : He articulates that his motivation for sharing insights comes from direct experiences and personal growth, not from existing ideologies or teachings. The sharing is aimed not at creating dogma but at illustrating the potential for individual transcendence and consciousness transformation. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Personal Exploration</strong> : The importance of direct, personal exploration of consciousness beyond mere belief or story sharing is underscored. Leo likens it to exploring the Amazon and stresses the need for individuals to personally undertake the journey to experience transformation. </li>
<li><strong>Inspiration and Technique Sharing</strong> : Leo clarifies that his role is to open minds to the possibilities of consciousness expansion, inspire action, and provide practical techniques for exploration. He laments viewers' reluctance to apply these techniques, emphasizing that actual transformation requires personal commitment to action. </li>
<li><strong>Warnings Against Complacency</strong> : The video warns of the dangers of becoming complacent with entertainment and distractions, urging viewers to live a self-actualizing life by continually challenging themselves and expanding their consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Roles and Functions of the Speaker</strong> : Leo portrays himself as a guide who presents possibilities, inspires action, shares techniques, and helps avoid pitfalls in the pursuit of consciousness expansion and self-actualization. He calls to action to avoid wasting life's potential and to embrace the tedious but transformative journey of personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation and Inspiration</strong> : Leo explains that intrinsic motivation and being inspired&mdash;'filled with spirit'&mdash;are essential for success in life. He attributes the content of his lectures to the universe speaking through him and emphasizes the importance of feeling spiritually motivated. </li>
<li><strong>Content to Expand Perspectives</strong> : He mentions that his blog, main videos, and secondary channel ActualizedClips, which features shorter segments, are resources created to share high consciousness content and expand viewers' perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Direct Consciousness and Experiences</strong> : Leo stresses the significance of not only understanding his teachings on an intellectual level but also experiencing them directly. Without such experiences, there's a risk that the teachings could become counterproductive, leading to dissatisfaction or depression. </li>
<li><strong>Gap Between Theory and Reality</strong> : Leo warns about the disconnect between the conceptual understanding of a beautiful, loving life and the stark reality of one's personal life. He advises bridging this gap by eventually moving from theory to practice. </li>
<li><strong>Actualization versus Communication</strong> : He admits that he speaks about concepts that he has not fully actualized himself. His aim is to expose viewers to the full range of human possibilities without imposing his personal limits on them. </li>
<li><strong>The Journey Is Messy and Non-Linear</strong> : He acknowledges the spiritual journey's non-linear nature&mdash;marked by backslides, ego backlashes, and confusions&mdash;and emphasizes the importance of keeping on despite the messiness and unique challenges personal to everyone's experience. </li>
<li><strong>Effective Use of Time</strong> : Leo discusses the finite nature of time and the importance of learning from mistakes without repetition to ensure growth and progress in the spiritual journey. </li>
<li><strong>Transition from Theory to Practice</strong> : He advises viewers to shift from theory learning to practical application after a certain period. This transition is crucial to prevent the theory from becoming dysfunctional due to a lack of actual practice. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Conscious Exploration</strong> : Leo reflects on the difficulties related to bridging the gap between knowing and living the teachings. He emphasizes the real and gradual nature of life transformations through continual learning, correcting mistakes, and growing.</li>
