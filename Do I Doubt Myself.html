            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/do-i-doubt-myself' target='_blank'>Do I Doubt Myself?</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Self-doubt and confirmation</strong> : Leo deals with self-doubt by deeply investigating his beliefs, leading to a confident understanding of concepts like God and enlightenment. This process includes challenging his biases and fears over two decades, rather than passively reaffirming them.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving beliefs through skepticism and open-mindedness</strong> : His journey has involved radical open-mindedness and a willingness to change his stance drastically, even by 180 or 360 degrees, as a result of his extensive introspection and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>The purpose of open-mindedness</strong> : Leo clarifies that being radically open-minded is important, but it should not equate to embracing ignorance or foolish ideas. True open-mindedness is meant to guide one towards truth, not to uphold skepticism indefinitely or to entertain every possibility without discernment.</li>
<li><strong>Reaching the absolute truth</strong> : While skepticism is integral to the truth-seeking process, there is a point where it must end. Leo describes reaching absolute truth as a definitive experience beyond further doubt, while recognizing that continued skepticism at this stage can lead to delusion.</li>
<li><strong>Pathological doubt versus spiritual realization</strong> : Persistent doubt can become dysfunctional when it prevents acceptance of profound realizations like being God. The journey's goal is to differentiate between destructive skepticism leading to nihilism and the path toward spiritual enlightenment and divine embodiment.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming skepticism to realize the Absolute</strong> : Leo acknowledges the importance of skepticism in his spiritual journey but explains that there comes a point where excessive skepticism only hinders further growth. He emphasizes that to reach higher understanding, one must let go of skepticism and fear, as they become obstacles to recognizing and fully accepting deep, absolute realizations. The surrender of skepticism is necessary to truly embrace the absolute and break free from self-imposed limitations and delusional doubt.</li>
<li><strong>Misidentification with skepticism as a form of devilry</strong> : Leo describes that being overly attached to skepticism can be counterproductive, equating it to a form of self-deception or "devilry." He warns that even profound experiences of the divine can be dismissed by the skeptical mind, which refuses to acknowledge its nature as absolute. To advance spiritually, one must be willing to let go of this resistance and accept the possibility of complete surrender to the divine.</li>
<li><strong>Fear as the root of skepticism and doubt</strong> : He further argues that skepticism and doubt stem from fear, which is a defensive mechanism employed by the ego to preserve its sense of separateness and survival. Leo points out that embracing the absence of fear is key to moving beyond doubt and skepticism. By surrendering to the absolute truth, one no longer needs the protection that doubt supposedly provides, entering a state of infinite consciousness devoid of fear.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining humility alongside realization of divinity</strong> : Despite declaring that he has no doubt about being God, Leo distinguishes between the certainty of his divine nature and the awareness that he is not omniscient in every relative matter. He stresses the need to remain humble and open to learning and changing beliefs concerning mundane or specific knowledge, where mistakes and misinterpretations are still possible.</li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Absolute and Relative Knowledge</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the realization of absolute truth and the relative knowledge of human existence, such as dietary choices. Enlightenment on spiritual matters does not translate to omniscience in everyday mundane issues, which are subject to experimentation and personal variance.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Humility in Enlightenment</strong> : Leo advocates for humility in the face of enlightenment. He recognizes he will likely change his opinions on relative matters and stresses the importance of acknowledging that enlightenment and mastery in one area do not prevent mistakes or limitations in others. He mentions instances where even the Buddha revised his initial beliefs, demonstrating that enlightenment is a nuanced state rather than simple perfection.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Guru Exploitation and Delusion</strong> : Leo warns of the potential for exploitation by gurus who are mistakenly considered infallible and urges caution when following spiritual leaders. He highlights the importance of understanding that enlightenment does not eliminate one's vulnerability to deception or error in relative, worldly matters.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Programming and Embracing Divinity</strong> : Leo understands the challenges faced by individuals from religious backgrounds when trying to embrace their own divinity. He encourages overcoming deep-seated cultural programming to realize one's unity with the divine, even when such realizations appear sacrilegious within their traditional religious belief systems.</li>
<li><strong>Granting Permission to Recognize Divinity</strong> : Leo conceptualizes himself as a conduit, giving listeners the permission to accept their divinity in a non-arrogant manner. He frames this recognition as an inner transformation from being a divided devil to the omniscient god, suggesting that accepting one's divinity is akin to acknowledging one's ultimate authority over their own experience and existence.</li>
