        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/xyzYKVL5CB0' target='_blank'>How Authority Works - Where Does Truth Come From</a></h1>
        <p><em>"A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth." - Albert<br />
Einstein</em></p>
<p><em>"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him." - Zen Master Linji</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature of Authority</strong> : Authority is the power or trust that individuals place in others or entities to serve as sources of truth or knowledge. Leo emphasizes that people rely on authority constantly, without fully understanding its nature or origin. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge of Trust</strong> : Deciding who to trust, from religious texts to scientists and educators, is a fundamental challenge for everyone. Leo poses questions about validating the authority of these sources. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Regress Problem</strong> : Trust in any authority leads to a chain of questioning each source's credibility. Leo illustrates that this creates a circular problem of infinite regress since we can always question the authority of our sources of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Non-duality and True Authority</strong> : Leo explains that non-duality&mdash;everything being one without separation&mdash;means there can be no external authority, only oneself. The understanding that there is no 'other' to rely on for truth or knowledge is profound and essential. </li>
<li><strong>Self as Ultimate Authority</strong> : Leo posits that all individuals are the ultimate authority and arbiter of truth. He makes a radical claim stating individuals assert their own existence and, by extension, all truth in the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Individual as God</strong> : The concept that each person is God and has created themselves, the universe, and all other beings (though not consciously aware of it) is crucial. Self-awareness as God implies that there are no external sources of truth since all perceived sources are projections of one's mind. </li>
<li><strong>No External Validation for God</strong> : He examines the hypothetical scenario of a separate God needing validation for its existence. Leo argues that true God (the individual) could not turn towards anything external for validation of their existence or truth, as that would be a delusion in a state of oneness. </li>
<li><strong>Authority Derived from Self-Assertion</strong> : Leo affirms that individuals hold the deepest authority through their self-assertion, including the assertion that they exist, which does not require external verification. </li>
<li><strong>Unconscious Projection of Authority</strong> : People offload the responsibility of their absolute authority onto external figures or institutions unknowingly, creating a false sense of external validation and truth. </li>
<li><strong>Creating Value in Authority Figures</strong> : Leo makes clear that the perceived authority of prizes, degrees, credentials, and institutions has no inherent value other than the significance individuals collectively decide to give them. </li>
<li><strong>Reflection of Individual Authority</strong> : Trust in authoritative figures or entities is portrayed as a reflection of one's own projected authority, which is then mistakenly perceived as independent authority raining down on the individual. </li>
<li><strong>Authority in Scientific Research</strong> : All research, experiments, data, evidence, interpretations, and analyses are only considered true if one grants them authority; it&rsquo;s a subjective endorsement rather than an intrinsic quality. </li>
<li><strong>Individual's Role in Validating Science</strong> : One personally determines the validity of scientific experiments and research, not just the scientists conducting them. It&rsquo;s an individual's judgment that ultimately matters in assessing truth. </li>
<li><strong>Authority in Religious Contexts</strong> : Religions and their texts gain credence solely through the individual's choice to believe in them. Historical roles of priests, rabbis, and kings were seen as credible because society collectively agreed to give them authority. </li>
<li><strong>University's Religious Roots</strong> : Universities, originally religious institutions, have evolved, but the authority derived there is still granted by individual belief, highlighting the continuity of authority being a personal projection rather than inherent. </li>
<li><strong>Circular Reasoning in Religion</strong> : Fundamentalist religious adherents often use circular reasoning to justify their beliefs (e.g., the Bible is true because it's God's word), not realizing they are the source of that authority. </li>
<li><strong>Problem of Undue Faith in Science</strong> : The belief that science is immune to issues of faith is misguided; the scientific community struggles with the same authority challenges as religion. </li>
<li><strong>Nobel Prizes and Credibility in Science</strong> : The pursuit of accolades like Nobel Prizes is more about garnering respect and authority among peers than establishing objective truth, underscoring that in science authority is social, not empirical. </li>
<li><strong>Education System's Transferred Authority</strong> : Education systems rely on transmitting assumed truths rather than verified knowledge, with individuals accepting less than 1% of what is taught as truth without personal validation. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Political Authority</strong> : Political authority has evolved from being interlinked with religious and scientific authority to being more independent, reflecting shifts in the collective agreement about where to bestow authority. </li>
<li><strong>Authority in Spirituality and Non-Duality</strong> : Spirituality, especially non-dual teachings, can suffer from misplaced authority when individuals defer to teachings and teachers rather than realizing their own capacity to discern truth. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Practitioners and Authority Figures</strong> : Leo Gura points out that spiritual seekers often create new authority figures by following various teachers, gurus, and spiritual schools such as Zen or Yoga, without realizing they are projecting their authority onto these entities and thus hindering their awakening to being God. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Self as God</strong> : He emphasizes that recognizing oneself as God and the ultimate truth is hindered when one elevates gurus or spiritual doctrines above their own understanding, mistakenly thinking these external figures know more or are more enlightened. </li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Separate Truth</strong> : Leo argues that by considering others, such as Sadhguru, as higher authority figures who possess more truth, individuals fail to recognize that they themselves are the absolute truth, with no intermediary needed between them and this realization. </li>
<li><strong>Childhood Roots of Authority Seeking</strong> : The propensity to trust external authority figures is traced back to childhood when reliance on parents and teachers for survival is imperative. However, this reliance can persist unexamined into adulthood, obscuring fundamental truths that must come from within oneself. </li>
<li><strong>False Security in Anchored Reality</strong> : Gura discusses how individuals create a false sense of security by anchoring their reality in various belief systems&mdash;whether Christianity, Buddhism, science, or philosophy&mdash;to avoid the challenging task of figuring out reality for themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Danger of Blind Acceptance</strong> : He warns against blindly accepting cultural answers as truth without serious self-reflection, self-inquiry, and exploration of alternative perspectives, which erroneously simplifies the understanding of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Independent Thinking</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of critical thinking and decries common attitudes that downplay self-thought in favor of uncritically adopting the thoughts and beliefs of others, including spiritual wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Authority in Fundamentalism and Spirituality</strong> : He criticizes both religious fundamentalists and spiritual followers for devoting energy to rituals and external symbols while overlooking the ultimate pointer these signs are meant to reveal: their inherent divinity. </li>
<li><strong>Trapped in Devotion Without Self-Realization</strong> : Gura suggests that religious devotion, without the realization of one's own divinity, is futile and that individuals who do not acknowledge their role in assigning authority to their beliefs are unable to help themselves awaken fully. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of Belief Systems</strong> : Leo explains that strong beliefs in ideologies like Christianity, for individuals who fully embrace them, become irrefutable personal truths because such individuals have given these ideologies their ultimate authority, rendering them true in their experience. </li>
<li><strong>Authority and Cultural Religion</strong> : Individuals typically adopt the religion of their culture not through sophisticated choice, but through conformity, lacking exploration of alternatives, which Leo likens to robotic or zombie-like behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Authority in Scientific Rationalism</strong> : Leo critiques scientific rationalists, like fans of Sam Harris, for constructing their own authorities through a preference for scientific studies and materialist approaches without actually deeply questioning or understanding the epistemology of science. </li>
<li><strong>Skepticism and Debunking</strong> : He also notes that skeptics and debunkers set up their own authorities that they trust for skepticism and debunking, making modern skepticism ironically self-defeating without realizing it. </li>
<li><strong>Zen and Buddha Worshippers</strong> : Leo observes that even in seemingly pure spiritual paths like Zen, followers often fail to self-enlighten because they are preoccupied with worshiping their masters or idols like Buddha without realizing they are themselves the Buddha. </li>
<li><strong>Devotion to Gurus in Hindu Spirituality</strong> : Leo criticizes excessive devotion to gurus in Hindu spirituality and yoga as a significant barrier to followers fully reclaiming their authority and realizing their inherent Godhood. </li>
<li><strong>Mental Delusion and Loss of Reality</strong> : Using mentally deranged individuals and conspiracy theorists as case studies, Leo shows how they create their own realities by giving their beliefs absolute authority, showcasing how difficult it is to change such beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Open-Mindedness as Antidote</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of open-mindedness to prevent being trapped by one's own delusional beliefs and to discover one's Godhood. </li>
<li><strong>The Process of Reclaiming Authority</strong> : To reclaim personal authority, Leo suggests tracing back the origin of one's beliefs, becoming aware of daily authority seeding, taking ownership of beliefs, thinking independently, and pursuing personal truth realization. </li>
<li><strong>Realizing Divinity</strong> : For true enlightenment, individuals need to realize they are God through their own epiphany, and not merely believe it because someone else said so or as an abstract idea. </li>
<li><strong>Validation and Consciousness</strong> : Leo Gura underscores that seeking external validation for one's divinity indicates a lack of consciousness. True recognition of oneself as God, or ultimate authority, requires accessing infinite consciousness and intelligence. </li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of External Validation in Non-Dual State</strong> : He asserts that in a state of non-dual God consciousness, the distinction between internal and external, including traditional concepts like proof, evidence, and science, dissolves into irrelevance. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of External Validation</strong> : Chasing external validation signifies being captivated by the illusion of others and not realizing the self-originating nature of authority. </li>
<li><strong>Solitude in Omniscience</strong> : Achieving omniscience and realizing oneself as the sole existence brings both the ultimate truth and the realization of being entirely alone, unable to share this truth with the imagined 'others'. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Ground of Authority</strong> : Leo emphasizes that individuals must fully reclaim their authority, which involves grounding oneself in the absolute truth to avoid reliance on validation from others. </li>
<li><strong>Danger of Authority Compromise</strong> : Compromising truth by seeking external validation leads individuals to align with fallacies and misconceptions, which Leo metaphorically attributes to 'compromising with Devils'. </li>
<li><strong>Truth Discovery and Critical Thinking</strong> : Leo advises viewers to develop their own conclusions critically, embracing constructive feedback and expert perspectives not for validation, but for exposure to new worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>God's Limitations as Blind Spots</strong> : Highlighting that God encompasses all, including limitations, Leo notes that 'God' or one's ultimate consciousness can still have blind spots. These can be addressed through the input and different perspectives of 'others'. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Self-Deception and Authority</strong> : Leo addresses the role of false authority in society satisfied through basic survival needs which lead to manipulation, hoarding of authority, and conflict. Distinguishing between one's divine self and ego is crucial to avert self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Self and God</strong> : The paradox of being God, according to Leo, is manifesting as a singular authority with absolute truth, while also recognizing the impossibility of communicating this truth to others who are perceived as separate. </li>
<li><strong>Reflection and Cross-Referencing</strong> : Leo advises cross-referencing diverse sources of information to counteract personal delusions and maintaining vigilance against self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Self-Reflection on Actualized.org</strong> : He concludes by contemplating the possibility of his own teachings being a delusion, but stands by his realization of being God, an authority that may appear misguided to those who have yet to reach this state of consciousness.</li>
