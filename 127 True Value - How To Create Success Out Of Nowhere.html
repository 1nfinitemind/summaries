            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/svS_P7mBhf4' target='_blank'>True Value - How To Create Success Out Of Nowhere</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Understanding True Value</strong> : Leo explores the concept of true value, contrasting it with perceived value that society, family, or others may impress upon us. True value relates more closely to individual benefits and personal fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Case Study - Video Game Designer</strong> : He shares an anecdote about a client who is a video game designer, initially unable to see the learning potential at his job. Leo reveals the client had access to the GDC vault, a goldmine for industry knowledge, which the client had underestimated. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Value vs Individual Value</strong> : Using the example of a Ferrari versus a Toyota Camry, Leo discusses how societal value can overshadow practical or true individual value. The true value lies in what something can genuinely offer to one's life and level of fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Apparent Value Versus True Value in Objects</strong> : The assigned price of an item like a book carries an apparent value, but its true value could be transformative if the book contains life-changing insights or inspires the start of a successful business. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Experience with Untapped Resources</strong> : Leo reflects on his own experiences, recognizing that he sits on a 'vault of gold' in terms of books and personal development resources that he has yet to fully utilize, demonstrating a common oversight of true value. </li>
<li><strong>Call to Action for Conscious Awareness</strong> : He urges the audience to consciously assess the true value in their lives &mdash; from diet and exercise to careers and personal development &mdash; to capitalize on resources that are often overlooked due to unawareness. </li>
<li><strong>Illustrating the Divergence between Apparent and True Value</strong> : Leo explains how a simple act, like reading a strategically valuable book, can dramatically alter one's life course, potentially leading from a menial job to creating a successful business and accumulating wealth. </li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Resource Utilization</strong> : Concluding the section, Leo invites viewers to consider the true potential value of the resources around them, including the content on Actualized.org, which could be instrumental in transforming lives and perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Awareness and True Value</strong> : Leo describes conscious awareness as crucial for recognizing true value in various aspects of life. By contemplating and questioning the real value within different components like gym routines, dietary habits, business, family, hobbies, and social interactions, one can make more informed decisions that align with personal fulfillment and well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Value Traps and Societal Influence</strong> : Leo warns against falling into 'value traps,' where certain activities are pursued due to societal pressures or personal conditioning, without true alignment with one's fulfillment. He urges viewers to scrutinize their motivations, especially concerning apparent values like owning a luxury car or chasing promotions and money, which may not lead to genuine happiness or contentment. </li>
<li><strong>Independent-Mindedness for Success and Happiness</strong> : Leo suggests that to lead extraordinary lives, individuals must think independently and resist the mediocrity and superficiality often promoted by societal norms. He emphasizes the importance of critical thinking to discern true value from apparent value. </li>
<li><strong>Money, Success, and Fulfillment</strong> : While not inherently against the pursuit of money, Leo cautions against seeking wealth for superficial reasons. Authentic reasons for desiring financial success are encouraged, but pursuing money to appear more successful or due to societal conditioning may result in dissatisfaction. </li>
<li><strong>Choosing True Value</strong> : Leo challenges viewers to prioritize true value, which can involve sacrificing immediate pleasures, like socializing, for more fulfilling activities, such as learning and personal growth. He emphasizes that recognizing and acting on real value can lead to long-term success and fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org's Proposition</strong> : In closing, Leo highlights the potential value of resources available on Actualized.org, such as videos that, if applied effectively, could significantly transform lives. He invites viewers to sign up for the newsletter, which offers tips, videos, and the opportunity to win free coaching sessions, all aimed at helping his audience lead extraordinary lives by understanding and pursuing true value.</li>
