            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/TyDoJThWvAw' target='_blank'>How To Stop Being A Workaholic</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's personal confession</strong> : Leo admits to being a workaholic himself and expresses his current efforts to address this issue, recognizing its detrimental nature. </li>
<li><strong>Criteria for workaholism</strong> : Leo proposes that working over eight hours a day or 40 hours a week, taking work personally, working weekends and holidays, and avoiding vacations are signs of workaholism. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of being a workaholic</strong> : A range of negative effects includes chronic agitation, compromised creativity, burnout, potential long-term health issues, and stifled psychological development. </li>
<li><strong>Workaholism's stymying of self-actualization</strong> : Leo suggests that workaholism limits personal growth, leading to an imbalance that neglects self-actualization and the appreciation of life's beauty. </li>
<li><strong>The psychological root of workaholism</strong> : Leo identifies deep-seated feelings of worthlessness or incompleteness as the fundamental cause, where work becomes tied to identity and self-worth. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional impact of enforced non-working</strong> : Imagining a scenario where one is not allowed to work anymore, Leo discusses the prospect of experiencing negative emotions, highlighting an unhealthy relationship with work. </li>
<li><strong>Construct of fulfillment in work</strong> : Workaholics set conditions for fulfillment that are tied to completion of work, creating brief moments of satisfaction followed by the urgent need to start new projects. </li>
<li><strong>Illusions of work-related fulfillment</strong> : Leo argues that the feelings of worth, value, and meaning through work are illusory, as they don't inherently exist. </li>
<li><strong>Existential avoidance through work</strong> : He explains that constant activity is employed to avoid facing existential voids, which includes the truth that worth, value, and meaning are not inherently present in life. </li>
<li><strong>The truth of 'no self'</strong> : Leo touches upon the concept of enlightenment and 'no-self', implying that the ultimate solution lies in realizing the absence of any inherent entity within oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Productivity and worth comparisons</strong> : He challenges the notion that productivity increases worth, positing that all human beings hold equal intrinsic value regardless of their accomplishments. </li>
<li><strong>Motivation behind work</strong> : Leo distinguishes between positive, creative expression through work and using work to avoid facing an inner void or feelings of worthlessness. He asserts it's crucial to understand whether work is a genuine expression or a defense mechanism. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of consciousness in action</strong> : The advice here is to be conscious of the motivations driving work habits, understanding whether work is an escape from accepting life's inherent meaninglessness. </li>
<li><strong>Ego and the illusion of self</strong> : Leo describes the ego as an empty void that dons various "garments" in an attempt to feel real and substantial. He suggests that many work to avoid looking into this void, filling life with distractions rather than facing it. </li>
<li><strong>Facing the void for liberation</strong> : Embracing life's meaninglessness and the void within, according to Leo, leads to liberation from workaholism. It allows one to live without the false layers of self-built through work. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of life's meaninglessness</strong> : Leo emphasizes that life's meaninglessness should not be turned into a negative meaning; rather, it should be seen as a neutral fact, freeing individuals from chasing illusory worth. </li>
<li><strong>The concept of equal worth</strong> : Using the analogy of comparing a successful person, a homeless person, and a dog, Leo argues that worth is a made-up concept and all entities have equal worth in reality. </li>
<li><strong>Reflection on worth as a social fiction</strong> : Leo suggests worth is entirely constructed within social contexts, like comparing car brands, and encourages viewers to contemplate the real nature of worth as an exercise. </li>
<li><strong>Examining the origins of feelings of worthlessness</strong> : He encourages viewers to reflect on their childhood and other past experiences that may contribute to current feelings of worthlessness or the drive to prove oneself through work. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing present completeness</strong> : Leo invites viewers to recognize and accept their innate completeness, rather than postponing fulfillment to future achievements. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment and confronting the void</strong> : The concept of 'no-self' and enlightenment is presented as the ultimate way to experience completeness and embrace the void within. </li>
<li><strong>Practical steps to curbing workaholism</strong> : Leo advises acknowledging the tendency to run away from the void, meditating, practicing mindfulness, working less, and taking real vacations to explore neglected aspects of life. </li>
<li><strong>Growth in psychology</strong> : Finally, Leo advocates for continuous learning and self-actualization, noting the vast potential for personal growth and the rewarding nature of expanding one&#39;s psychology through subscribing to his newsletter.</li>
