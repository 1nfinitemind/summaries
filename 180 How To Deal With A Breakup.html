</li><li><b>Permanent fixes</b>: It's not enough to just recognize issues such as neediness or poor relationship skills; there must be a commitment to permanently fix these areas.

</li><li><b>Self–Actualization Motives</b>: Improving oneself should primarily be for personal gain and not solely with the intent of attracting someone else. Bad habits contribute to personal misery, which in turn negatively affects relationships.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Hollywood Romance</b>: Hollywood romantic narratives often foster the illusion of losing "the special one" post–breakup. Recognizing this as an illusion is key to understanding that no individual is irreplaceable.
</li><li><b>Abundance Mindset</b>: Cultivating an abundance mindset is important to overcome the feeling of loss and to recognize that there are many potential partners available, dismissing the notion of one unique soulmate.
