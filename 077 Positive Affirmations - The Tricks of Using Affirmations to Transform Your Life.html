        <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's introduction to affirmations</strong> : Leo advocates for using positive affirmations, citing extensive personal development research and his successful experiences with the practice over six months. </li>
<li><strong>Subconscious reprogramming</strong> : Affirmations serve to retrain the subconscious mind by instilling empowering thoughts through repeated short statements. </li>
<li><strong>Example of affirmation</strong> : Leo uses "I am a millionaire" as an affirmation, despite not being one yet, demonstrating how affirmations aim to inspire faith and confidence beyond present reality. </li>
<li><strong>The role of affirmations</strong> : They are meant to shift the focus from current limitations to potential outcomes, addressing areas where doubts and fears typically hold one back. </li>
<li><strong>Subconscious mind characteristics</strong> : The subconscious is likened to a sponge that absorbs repeated messages, regardless of their factual accuracy, and requires brute force and repetition to be shaped. </li>
<li><strong>Regular practice</strong> : Affirmations demand daily practice, akin to training an animal, through uninterrupted and focused repetition, preferably in quiet settings. </li>
<li><strong>Duration of practice</strong> : Commit to at least a month of daily affirmations on a specific issue, with longer periods for deeply entrenched limiting beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Affirmation characteristics</strong> : Keep affirmations short and positive, ensuring they are phrased as concise slogans easily repeated within a five-minute routine. </li>
<li><strong>Identity-centric affirmations</strong> : Affirmations starting with "I am" are potent for shaping identity and core self-beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Specificity in affirmations</strong> : The more precise and detailed the affirmation, the better the subconscious can latch onto and believe in the envisioned reality. </li>
<li><strong>Present tense usage</strong> : Affirmations should be stated as if the desired state is current reality to instill a sense of ownership and actualization in the present. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's closing on affirmations</strong> : Further tips and techniques are available on actualised.org, and affirmations are pitched as an invaluable tool for overcoming limiting beliefs and pursuing personal development goals.</li>
