    <li><b>Leo's introduction to affirmations</b>: Leo advocates for using positive affirmations, citing extensive personal development research and his successful experiences with the practice over six months.
</li><li><b>Subconscious reprogramming</b>: Affirmations serve to retrain the subconscious mind by instilling empowering thoughts through repeated short statements.
</li><li><b>Example of affirmation</b>: Leo uses "I am a millionaire" as an affirmation, despite not being one yet, demonstrating how affirmations aim to inspire faith and confidence beyond present reality.
</li><li><b>The role of affirmations</b>: They are meant to shift the focus from current limitations to potential outcomes, addressing areas where doubts and fears typically hold one back.
</li><li><b>Subconscious mind characteristics</b>: The subconscious is likened to a sponge that absorbs repeated messages, regardless of their factual accuracy, and requires brute force and repetition to be shaped.
</li><li><b>Regular practice</b>: Affirmations demand daily practice, akin to training an animal, through uninterrupted and focused repetition, preferably in quiet settings.
</li><li><b>Duration of practice</b>: Commit to at least a month of daily affirmations on a specific issue, with longer periods for deeply entrenched limiting beliefs.
</li><li><b>Affirmation characteristics</b>: Keep affirmations short and positive, ensuring they are phrased as concise slogans easily repeated within a five–minute routine.
</li><li><b>Identity–centric affirmations</b>: Affirmations starting with "I am" are potent for shaping identity and core self–beliefs.
</li><li><b>Specificity in affirmations</b>: The more precise and detailed the affirmation, the better the subconscious can latch onto and believe in the envisioned reality.
</li><li><b>Present tense usage</b>: Affirmations should be stated as if the desired state is current reality to instill a sense of ownership and actualization in the present.
</li><li><b>Leo's closing on affirmations</b>: Further tips and techniques are available on actualised.org, and affirmations are pitched as an invaluable tool for overcoming limiting beliefs and pursuing personal development goals.
