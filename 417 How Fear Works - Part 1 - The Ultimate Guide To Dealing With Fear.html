        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/meiMUbYEQ4U' target='_blank'>How Fear Works - Part 1 - The Ultimate Guide To Dealing With Fear</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Tell me who you are and I'll tell you what you fear.</em></p>
<p><em>Tell me what you fear and I'll tell you who you are."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature of fear</strong> : Fear is a fundamental existential issue, not just psychological, affecting all of consciousness and dominating our entire lives. It often goes unrecognized due to society's materialistic focus, which neglects emotions that cannot be easily quantified. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a self-control mechanism</strong> : Fear acts as a sophisticated mechanism to maintain our identity and survive, controlling actions and decisions often outside our awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Survival and identity</strong> : Human survival extends beyond the physical&mdash;it involves maintaining social and cultural identities. Fear ensures the preservation of these identities, with each unique identity generating specific fears. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and identity maintenance</strong> : Fear is deeply tied to what we identify with, as it motivates us to avoid threats to our self-image, be it religious, cultural, or professional. </li>
<li><strong>Fear's link to our perceptions</strong> : How we perceive reality is greatly influenced by fear attached to our identities, impacting everything from our daily choices to scientific objectivity. </li>
<li><strong>Confronting Fear for Personal Growth</strong> : Acknowledging and confronting one's fears is crucial for personal development. Avoiding fear only leads to stagnation and a victim mentality. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a self-fulfilling prophecy</strong> : Persistent fear can lead to attracting the very outcomes we are afraid of, highlighting fear's intricate connection with our psychology and actions. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and societal impact</strong> : Collective fear within groups such as societies and governments can lead to decisions that cause wider negative effects, like racism or bad legislation. </li>
<li><strong>Love as a counter to fear</strong> : Life's adversities challenge us to learn how to love and transcend fear, contributing to personal evolution and fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding micro fears</strong> : Observing and analyzing our frequent 'micro fears' can shed light on the pervasive impact of fear and help us take radical responsibility for our emotions and their relation to our identities. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and Career Identity</strong> : For many individuals, a significant portion of life revolves around their careers, leading to fears directly related to their occupational roles. If one's identity is intrinsically tied to their career or business, the fear of losing that role or failing within it can become a dominant force in their life. </li>
<li><strong>Attachment to Possessions and Fear</strong> : When individuals strongly identify with material possessions, such as cars, boats, or any valued property, they become fearful of losing them. These fears are treated with the seriousness of life-and-death situations due to the emotional value attached to these items. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of Losing Success, Fame, and Status</strong> : For those who identify with wealth, fame, or status, the fear of losing these can be overwhelming and can be perceived as greater than personal losses. Leo points out that all fears, regardless of how society views them, are relative and stem from one's attachments and identity. </li>
<li><strong>Fear's Relationship with Identity</strong> : Fears are tightly intertwined with what one identifies as; for example, fears of losing attractiveness or being perceived negatively are rooted in one's self-concept. These fears act like inner demons that individuals battle throughout their lives. </li>
<li><strong>Identity-Driven Fears are Persistent</strong> : Unlike transient fears, identity-driven fears are deeply rooted and cannot be resolved through simple techniques. Fear resolution requires identity-level changes, as fears are inextricably linked to what we cling to as our identity. </li>
<li><strong>Fear in Religious and Scientific Identities</strong> : Leo explains that religious identities, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism, are filled with fear, such as the fear of losing one's faith. Similarly, scientific and skeptical identities are not immune to fear; skeptics fear being wrong or deluded, and this fear can ironically lead to becoming what they fear most. </li>
<li><strong>Gender Identity, Fear, and Societal Controversy</strong> : The controversy over gender identity, such as transgender and LGBTQ+ issues, showcases fear's role in identity defense. Traditional and conservative individuals may react with fear to the fluidity of gender categories, leading to denial and projection onto others. </li>
<li><strong>Identity Formation as an Unconscious Process</strong> : From childhood to adolescence, individuals unconsciously construct their identities through interactions and experiences. Leo emphasizes that identities are not simply given but are created over time, which can lead to fear when challenged or threatened. </li>
<li><strong>Attachment and Identity Depth</strong> : Leo uses the Sun as an analogy to describe the layers of one's identity, with peripheral attachments like possessions being less integral and core attachments like being human or physical being much harder to detach from. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Ultimate Fear of Loss of Self</strong> : All fears ultimately boil down to the fear of loss of self, whether it's physical harm or psychological loss of identity. The fear of changing aspects of oneself that have been part of one's identity since early childhood is profound and challenging to overcome. </li>
<li><strong>Attachment to Identity and Fear of Change</strong> : People have an attachment to their identity, and sudden changes, such as altering one's career or religion, can cause negative reactions from others. This reinforces fear due to the desire to be perceived positively and the fear of identity loss. </li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Fear and Self-Loss</strong> : All fears fundamentally relate to the fear of a total loss of self or identity. Radical examples, like suicide bombers, illustrate that some fear identity loss more than physical death, highlighting fear's strong tie to personal identity. </li>
<li><strong>Identity and Relative Danger</strong> : What we identify with dictates what we perceive as dangerous. A scientist may view religious interference as a threat, whereas a radical Islamist may see the erosion of Islamic values as the ultimate danger. Danger is not objective but relative to our identities. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a Construction of the Mind</strong> : Fear is not objective or natural; it's a mental construct projected onto the world through the lens of identity. What causes fear in one person might not affect another, underscoring the subjective nature of fear. </li>
<li><strong>Imaginary Nature of Fear</strong> : Leo argues that all fears, including the fear of death, are imaginary. The realization that fear lacks substance and is essentially "nothing" can significantly alter one's perception of life and relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Interpreting Fear as Falsehood</strong> : Since most people experience fear, it may seem normal; however, normality does not equate to truth. Fear is an illusion, a lack of consciousness, and complete awareness would lead to a fearless existence. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and Society's Materialistic Paradigm</strong> : Society operates under a materialistic paradigm, upholding the notion of objective reality, which legitimizes fears like death or financial ruin. Leo points out that danger, like fear, is a subjective concept based on personal identity and not inherent to situations. </li>
<li><strong>Fear Used as a Control Mechanism</strong> : Fear is exploited in society as a method of control through advertisements, politics, and social norms. Truth is fundamentally incompatible with fear and can help transcend it. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a Product of Denied Subjectivity</strong> : What we project as objective is merely our subjectivity in disguise. What one perceives as a threat is based entirely on their subjective experience. Fear is not found in the external world but is created internally. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a Falsehood Based on Reality Misperception</strong> : Fear originates from a false understanding of reality; it is born out of our minds misperceiving situations, which is why in full consciousness, fears cease to exist. </li>
<li><strong>Fear's Relationship with Consciousness</strong> : Achieving a state of full consciousness can lead to the realization that fear, including the fear of death, is an illusion. Fear cannot be fully understood without becoming individually acquainted with personal fears through mindfulness. </li>
<li><strong>Materialistic Paradigm vs. True Nature of Death</strong> : The materialistic view that death is an ultimate unknown strengthens fear, while Leo suggests that death might be just another misperception and not as physical and final as society believes. </li>
<li><strong>Practicing Mindfulness to Identify Fear</strong> : To comprehend fear, one must feel it in the body, identify its physical manifestation, which requires the development of mindfulness - a vital skill for gaining insight into the nature of fear. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and the Natural Instinct for Survival</strong> : Fear is an automatic reaction designed for immediate survival, interfering with the opportunity to understand or rationalize fear during moments of perceived danger. </li>
<li><strong>Creating a Mindful Gap in Response to Fear</strong> : To transcend fear, developing space between experiencing fear and reacting is essential. Observing and questioning fear mindfully is a counterintuitive yet powerful way to address it. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as Resistance to a Future Experience</strong> : Leo defines fear as a form of resistance to experiences that conflict with identity or desires. True power lies in consciously facing fears rather than reacting unconsciously. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Fear by Surrendering to Experience</strong> : Surrendering to and accepting the experiences we fear, instead of resisting them, eliminates fear. This requires a radical shift from the attachment to one's current identity. </li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness Exercise to Tackle Fear</strong> : Leo assigns the audience the task of practicing mindfulness with fears: identifying them as they happen, observing their connection to identity, and accepting potential future scenarios they resist. </li>
<li><strong>Solution to Overcoming Fear</strong> : The solution to overcoming debilitating fears involves a radical and counterintuitive acceptance of the worst outcomes. Leo suggests mentally preparing for and accepting scenarios that terrify us most in order to alleviate fear. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of Invincibility Through Fear Acceptance</strong> : Leo argues if fear were taught and mastered from early childhood, individuals would become invincible, as they would no longer be subject to the controls of society that leverage fear for power. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Control and Fear Management</strong> : Fear is not taught in schools as a way to cope because a society without fear would undergo drastic changes&mdash;potentially dismantling current power structures such as government, business, and religion. </li>
<li><strong>Misplaced Happiness on Material Possessions</strong> : Leo emphasizes the extent to which lives are built upon conditional happiness tied to material possessions, and how fear of losing them can cause intense anxiety and suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Building Happiness on Spiritual Development</strong> : True happiness, according to Leo, comes from spiritual development and consciousness&mdash;attributes that can't be taken away, unlike material possessions and circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Exercise in Surrendering to Fear</strong> : Leo suggests mentally accepting and surrendering to our fears, even those that are identity-based, such as sexual orientation. This practice brings relief but may require repetition and identity reevaluation for lasting impact. </li>
<li><strong>Strength from Acceptance and Surrender</strong> : Surrendering to experiences we fear most, Leo argues, is the real strength and the essence of spiritual growth&mdash;it involves the ability to experience anything without resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Alignment with Truth Overcoming Fear</strong> : The crux of overcoming fear is not about convincing oneself of any falsehood but about being totally aligned with truth, which requires a high degree of consciousness and spiritual work. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a Fundamental Survival Mechanism</strong> : Fear operates at a more fundamental level than logic, ideals, or beliefs, making it resilient to rational counterarguments and necessitating direct experiential confrontation. </li>
<li><strong>Exercise to Confront Personal Fears</strong> : Leo instructs viewers to list their greatest fears concisely, aiming to realistically confront and address them for personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Common Misconceptions about Fears</strong> : People often consider fears superficially, listing stereotypical ones like fear of spiders, snakes, or public speaking, without addressing fears that significantly affect daily life and self-identity. </li>
<li><strong>Stereotypical fears and their limitations</strong> : Stereotypical fears such as the fear of poison are seen as relatively superficial and not affecting daily life significantly. These fears are not as impactful as deeper, more personal fears which will be addressed. </li>
<li><strong>Donald Trump's fear of poisoning</strong> : Leo analyzes Donald Trump's fear of being poisoned, relating it to his connections with Russia and their reputation for using poison. This example shows how specific fears can be tied to personal experiences and relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Macro fears affecting daily life</strong> : Leo lists fears with substantial impact on daily life, such as fear of failure, financial ruin, relationship breakdowns, loneliness, aging, and the pressure to meet others' expectations. These fears shape behaviors and decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Micro fears shaping daily activities</strong> : 'Micro fears'&mdash;small, frequent fears occurring every day&mdash;greatly influence habits and decisions. Examples include fear of running out of toilet paper, lying, or offending someone. Though minor, their frequent occurrence has a significant cumulative effect. </li>
<li><strong>Physical manifestations of fear</strong> : Chronic fear can manifest as physical ailments like mental illnesses, obesity, and heart disorders, demonstrating the importance of recognizing and addressing fear both mentally and physically. </li>
<li><strong>Avoidance of fear leading to larger issues</strong> : Avoiding or denying fears contributes to victim mentality and does not foster growth or resolution of the underlying issues. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as an innate but complex response</strong> : While fear is a natural response to danger, in modern society, it can become complex and pathological, underscoring the necessity to confront fears for personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Observation as a tool for understanding fear</strong> : Leo suggests observing everyday 'micro fears' to understand their pervasive influence and relation to one's identity, advocating for conscious engagement with these fears as a pathway to personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Common micro fears</strong> : We constantly face small, daily fears such as fear of getting a cold, speaking to a boss, bad breath, something stuck in teeth, potential pregnancy, store closing before arrival, cleaning the garage, doing taxes, paying rent, confronting someone, honesty with parents, expressing opinions, missing gym sessions, doctor visits, making work mistakes, meeting outcomes, forgetting crucial tasks, people not texting back, finding life purpose, working overtime, being judged, and coworkers' betrayal. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of financial consequences</strong> : Fears extend to financial consequences like being fired, credit card fees, bank account checks, missed opportunities, and breaking good habits, which significantly impact our decisions and stress levels. </li>
<li><strong>Creative anxiety</strong> : A distinct type of fear experienced in creative fields, leading to stress and inhibition in artistic expression and productivity. </li>
<li><strong>Observation of micro fears</strong> : Leo urges to start noticing these micro fears and recognize how they shape our behavior and thoughts. </li>
<li><strong>Physical symptoms of fear</strong> : Fear is not just psychological but is stored as tension in the body, causing health issues like panic attacks, anxiety, heart issues, sexual dysfunctions, addictions, mental illnesses, obesity, insomnia, cancer, reduced lifespan, headaches, chronic fatigue, hormone imbalances, high blood pressure, back and neck pain, digestive issues, suicide, and violent ideologies. </li>
<li><strong>Fear's societal consequences</strong> : Fear can lead to social problems such as racism, closed-mindedness, bad decision-making, poor science, and irrational laws, emphasizing that individual fears also translate into collective societal actions. </li>
<li><strong>Life as a 'love simulator'</strong> : Leo describes life as a simulator for learning to love and not to fear, suggesting that overcoming fears enhances one's capacity to love. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding fear leads to stagnation</strong> : Avoiding or denying fear results in stagnation and victim mentality, while confronting fear promotes growth and immediate relief. </li>
<li><strong>Pathological behaviors from fear avoidance</strong> : Avoidance can lead to harmful behaviors like addictions, lying, and unethical ideologies. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of manipulative fear coping</strong> : Manipulation can provide short-term relief but is not a lasting solution to fear and doesn't prepare one for unavoidable life events like death. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as counterproductive for long-term survival</strong> : Fear-based responses can maintain the status quo, impede personal growth, and attract the very outcomes people are trying to avoid. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a self-fulfilling prophecy in relationships and professions</strong> : Fear in relationships and professions can lead to self-sabotaging behaviors that bring about the very issues one is afraid of, such as relationship breakdowns or professional failure. </li>
<li><strong>Bias and misperceptions from fear</strong> : Fear can lead to biases and the search for confirming information, reinforcing fears and causing conflicts. </li>
<li><strong>End assignment for understanding fear</strong> : List everyday 'micro fears', consider how they relate to personal identity, and reflect on the fears one is resisting to experience, to take responsibility for one's emotions and fears. </li>
<li><strong>Manipulation and Fear</strong> : Leo explains that while manipulating situations can temporarily circumvent fears, it fails in the long term and can't influence fundamental human experiences such as love, truth, and death. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a Poor Long-Term Survival Strategy</strong> : He remarks that fear, while effective against immediate physical threats like facing a bear, is counterproductive in complex human societies where it often leads to self-fulfilling negative outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of Self-Fulfilling Fears</strong> : He gives examples like the fear of a partner cheating or a business failing and explains how these fears can lead to behaviors that ultimately bring about the feared outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Fear, Bias, and Self-Perpetuation</strong> : Leo discusses how fear can perpetuate biases and conflicts, as seen in the fear of immigrants and how confirmation bias leads to reinforcing negative stereotypes and escalating tensions. </li>
<li><strong>The Loop of Fear</strong> : He describes fear as creating a yo-yo effect, where negative motivation only temporarily resolves fear, invariably leading to a rebound – like the cycle of losing and gaining weight. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and Personal Growth</strong> : Leo concludes that fear maintains the status quo and is detrimental to personal growth, creativity, and happiness, contrasting fear-based governance with visionary changes exemplified by Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights activism. </li>
<li><strong>Homework on Micro Fears</strong> : Leo assigns the viewers homework to observe, list, and analyze their 'micro fears' over seven days to understand how fears are projections of the mind and stem from identity, influencing our thoughts and actions. </li>
<li><strong>Part Two Teaser</strong> : Leo teases the upcoming part two of the lecture series, which promises to provide answers to common questions, introduce tools for overcoming fear, and reveal the most crucial quality needed for life success.</li>
