            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/QOsUx9a3UoU' target='_blank'>My Enlightenment Experience - Exactly How It Happened</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Second enlightenment experience</strong> : Leo recounts his second major enlightenment experience during a 10-day silent meditation retreat in Virginia, which he compares to his earlier, less comprehensible experience. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge of lacking conceptual frameworks</strong> : Leo discusses the difficulty of making sense of his first enlightenment experience due to an absence of the intellectual frameworks he developed later, which are essential for interpreting such experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Conditions for the experience</strong> : He describes the serene natural setting near a chapel in Virginia, with rolling green hills, forests, birds, and a rainy ambiance, which provided the perfect backdrop for deep meditation. </li>
<li><strong>Utilizing the 'Do-Nothing' meditation technique</strong> : Leo practices the 'Do-Nothing' technique, where he allows his awareness to roam freely without intervention, leading to increased mental focus after initial wandering thoughts. </li>
<li><strong>Insight into 'spaciousness'</strong> : While contemplating the scenery, Leo gains insight into the concept of 'spaciousness', recognizing that in his visual perception, there is nothing behind or in front of observed objects, only the objects themselves and the space around them. </li>
<li><strong>Connecting insights with physical actions</strong> : He uses the 'well' technique, pointing his finger towards a tree and realizing that there is no tangible point of contact with his vision, reinforcing the insight of 'nothingness' around sensory experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Awareness of bodily sensations</strong> : Shifting focus to the stone balcony floor, Leo becomes aware of bodily sensations and applies the concept of spaciousness, noticing these sensations are not originating from or leading to any particular location. </li>
<li><strong>Application of self-inquiry method</strong> : Leaving the 'do-nothing' approach, Leo engages in self-inquiry, asking, "Who am I?" or "Who is the perceiver?" to deepen his understanding of the experience and consciousness itself. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in self-inquiry</strong> : Leo points out that asking "Who am I?" without producing honest, tangible answers leads to stagnation in self-inquiry. Genuine responses are crucial, even if they may initially be incorrect. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing fallibility of logical answers</strong> : Leo emphasizes that logical answers are inadequate in self-inquiry; what matters is attaining 'conscious traction'. This requires discarding logical conclusions for deeper, experiential understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution of self-perception</strong> : Initially, Leo's self-inquiry leads him to identify as a combination of body, mind, and observer. He soon realizes this is an ingrained belief, not an ultimate truth, which propels his meditation deeper. </li>
<li><strong>Societal influence on identity</strong> : Contemplating further, Leo recognizes the arbitrary nature of his identity ('I, Leo') as largely a construct of societal conditioning traced back to childhood. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of arbitrary self-identification</strong> : Leo's insight deepens as he realizes that identifying with his physical and mental sensations is an arbitrary partition of his entire being, akin to being a slice of the whole pizza. </li>
<li><strong>Eradicating perceived knowledge</strong> : Achieving a state of genuine 'not knowing' proves critical for progression in self-inquiry by allowing space for new insights and the emptying of preconceived notions of self. </li>
<li><strong>Open-mindedness to non-physical existence</strong> : As self-inquiry leads to an emptying of preconceptions, Leo becomes receptive to the possibility of existing as a non-physical, non-human entity. </li>
<li><strong>Insight into omnipresence</strong> : Leo has a significant insight, transitioning from the thought of being omnipresent to an embodied understanding&mdash;an experience likened to a 360-degree camera, positioned everywhere. </li>
<li><strong>Experience of supreme peace and stillness</strong> : A profound moment of clarity dawns, bringing immense peace and bliss, as Leo's awareness expands and equalizes, culminating in a tangible sense of omnipresence and unity with his surroundings. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Now and the Joy of Existence</strong> : Leo shares his profound experience of the 'absolute now', a state of profound presence beyond ordinary mindfulness of the present. He describes it as a heavenly sense of existence where you feel like God observing itself, and stresses that this state cannot be reached through thinking but rather through gaining conscious traction. </li>
<li><strong>Lucidity in Awareness</strong> : Leo details becoming completely lucid in his field of awareness, able to observe every detail around him. Despite a rapid stream of thoughts, he experienced a detachment from them, observing thoughts as separate phenomena without inherent meaning, just existing in the present moment. </li>
<li><strong>Thoughts as Phenomena</strong> : He gained insight into the nature of thoughts, realizing the substance of a thought is the phenomenon itself. This allowed him to disengage from the content of the thoughts and observe them as mere occurrences, which he considers a significant breakthrough in self-inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Altered Sense of Self During Meditation</strong> : Leo noticed a shift in how he perceived his personal sense of self during meditation. He felt his point of awareness move above and behind his head, giving him a sense of hovering above his body while also feeling omnipresent. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Enlightenment and Peak Experiences</strong> : Leo wrestles with whether his experience was enlightenment or just a peak experience. He hoped the state would be permanent, but suspected it might be transitory. </li>
<li><strong>Experience Wanes but Insights Remain</strong> : Leo's state of lucidity and omnipresence faded after about 90 minutes, but he retained a sense of calm and continued to feel enlightened. He maintained the insights gained from the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Zen Master Interpretation</strong> : Upon sharing his experience with a Zen master, Leo was told that he had glimpsed 'a few hairs of the ox's tail', indicating progress on the path to enlightenment but suggesting the journey was still only partially complete. </li>
<li><strong>Long-lasting Effects and Mind Expansion</strong> : Despite returning to a more typical state of mind, Leo feels that his mind has been permanently expanded. His meditation practices have become more powerful and he finds himself unintentionally meditating during routine activities, indicating a sustained level of mindfulness. </li>
<li><strong>Solidifying Practice and Proof of Concept</strong> : Leo is encouraged by his experience, taking it as proof that his meditation techniques are effective. He feels that his mind is now 'zoomed out' and that he is able to recreate aspects of his retreat experience during regular meditation, suggesting that he's closer to enlightenment than ever before. </li>
<li><strong>Motivation and Conviction</strong> : Leo hopes his experience motivates viewers to believe in the reality of enlightenment beyond just philosophy. He details the step-by-step process he underwent and recorded immediately after to ensure accuracy in sharing his self-inquiry technique. </li>
<li><strong>Proper Self-Inquiry Demonstration</strong> : The video serves as a demonstration for viewers practicing self-inquiry at home, highlighting common pitfalls and emphasizing the necessity of recognizing thoughts as phenomena without getting lost in them. </li>
<li><strong>Response to Enlightenment Video Criticism</strong> : Leo addresses concerns about making enlightenment videos without being fully enlightened. He prefers documenting his journey from the start to make it convincing and relatable, unlike distant yogis or Zen masters. </li>
<li><strong>Journey Documentation Significance</strong> : By sharing his progress and obstacles in real-time, Leo provides a raw and genuine look into the enlightenment process, showing the importance of overcoming doubts and struggles by oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Intentions Behind Content Delivery</strong> : Leo clarifies his direct and candid style is not meant to be arrogant but to communicate honestly and effectively; acknowledging the ongoing learning and evolving nature of personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Hands-On Experimentation</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to experiment with his shared insights and methods, retaining what works and discarding what doesn't&mdash;a call to approach personal development with an open, exploratory mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Preview of Upcoming Content</strong> : He hints at future videos based on insights from his retreat, aimed at improving mindfulness, meditation, and the journey towards enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Psychological Laws</strong> : Exploring psychological laws is analogous to understanding physical laws for building a fulfilling life. Leo promises life-changing profundity for those who apply these principles over time. </li>
<li><strong>Community Results and Impact</strong> : He shares receiving feedback from those applying the principles from Actualized.org, seeing significant life improvements, affirming the effectiveness of his work and encouraging continued engagement.</li>
