        <ul>
<li><strong>Day six meditation routine</strong> : Leo recounted a rigorous 10-hour meditation schedule with a mix of labeling, self-inquiry, and 'do nothing' practices, concluding with labeling his breath.</li>
<li><strong>Struggles with mental chatter and technique</strong> : Faced with a restless mind full of fantasies and cravings, Leo experienced fatigue with labeling and deliberated between continuing it or shifting more to self-inquiry.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed results with self-inquiry</strong> : He observed that not achieving breakthroughs in self-inquiry led to frustration and negativity, contrasting with mindfulness practice that yielded a steadier, more positive progression.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful 'do nothing' insights</strong> : Leo was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of the 'do nothing' approach, which spontaneously deepened into self-inquiry, although it did not culminate in the anticipated breakthroughs.</li>
<li><strong>Future planning versus present discipline</strong> : Despite being drawn to plan for the future, Leo recognized the importance of remaining present during the retreat and the danger of being consumed by creative thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Enlightening realization on retreat value</strong> : He had an insight that true appreciation for life comes from the present moment awareness attained through retreats, likening it to a form of intense self-imposed solitary confinement for deep personal development.</li>
<li><strong>Personal growth's challenging nature</strong> : Described personal growth as rare and tough, highlighting the genuine depth of the process beyond superficial achievements and highlighting the ongoing self-discipline it requires.</li>
<li><strong>Perspective on the work ahead</strong> : Leo confronted the daunting realization that continued, substantial effort is necessary to embody advanced concepts of self-actualization, beyond what was initially thought.</li>
<li><strong>Recording retreats and conceptualization</strong> : Acknowledged that creating video content can distract from the practice, but maintained the value in sharing his experiences to inspire rigorous self-work in others.</li>
<li><strong>The inescapable necessity of inner work</strong> : Emphasized that once individuals understand the critical importance of this inner work, there are no alternatives or distractions that can substitute for its completion, and this realization may take years to fully embrace.</li>
