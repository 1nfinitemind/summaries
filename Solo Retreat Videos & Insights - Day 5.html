            <ul>
<li><strong>Dedication to meditation</strong> : Meditated nonstop for over 10 hours including self-inquiry, breath labeling, and walking meditation, interspersed with continual mindfulness throughout day five.</li>
<li><strong>Dream and infinity encounter</strong> : Fell into a semi-dream state during self-inquiry, experiencing a glimpse of infinity, which was interrupted by a fear-induced awakening with a gunshot-like sound in the mind.</li>
<li><strong>Combining mindfulness and daily activities</strong> : Experimented with extreme mindfulness in everyday routines, slowing down to savor the minutiae of experiences, leading to a heightened sense of aliveness. </li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness of 'Do Nothing' practice</strong> : Realized the true potential of 'Do Nothing' meditation through complete surrender without any expectations, finding it to be one of the most productive and enlightening practices.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of practice types</strong> : Identified the need to strictly separate 'Do Nothing' meditation from self-inquiry for maximum effectiveness, rather than blending the two techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Perception of ordinary moments</strong> : Discovered that mindfulness reveals the many small details usually overlooked in daily life, providing an unexpected joy and pleasure from seemingly insignificant moments.</li>
<li><strong>Savoring life through mindfulness</strong> : Emphasized the ability to fully appreciate and savor life is rooted in being present and mindful of every little detail, rather than chasing external accomplishments or material possessions.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation for deepening practice</strong> : Expressed enthusiasm for the coming days of the retreat, with plans to further build mindfulness and delve into self-inquiry, anticipating a significant breakthrough.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment's role in meditation</strong> : Reinforced the importance of unwavering commitment to the meditation process, recognizing that a determined mindset prevents negative emotions from taking hold and allows for a more productive experience.</li>
<li><strong>Retreat progress and expectation management</strong> : Reflected on the retreat's progress, noting increased productivity in meditation, while maintaining an openness to whatever experiences may come, whether pleasant or challenging.</li>
