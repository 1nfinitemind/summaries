            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/my-health-situation' target='_blank'>My Health Situation</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Chronic health update</strong> : Leo shares an update on his chronic health struggles, particularly focusing on his battle with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's disease, conditions that have significantly impacted his energy levels and overall productivity. Despite various dietary changes and extensive medical testing, his symptoms have persisted, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic predisposition and ineffective medication</strong> : Leo notes that his mother also has hypothyroidism, suggesting a genetic component. Despite being prescribed thyroid medication, the benefits have been limited compared to others with the condition.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration into alternative medicines</strong> : After traditional medical avenues failed to yield results, Leo delved into alternative medicine, consulting various practitioners and undergoing numerous treatments in search of relief.</li>
<li><strong>Effects on life and work</strong> : The chronic fatigue has adversely affected Leo's energy levels for over a decade. He observes a decline from about 75-80% of normal energy levels to as low as 30-40%, which hinders his work, particularly with creating content and advancing personal projects. This energy depletion has led to a reliance on napping and an inability to sustain work without rest.</li>
<li><strong>Diet and lifestyle limitations</strong> : Leo speaks about his strict diet restrictions over the past two years, eliminating gluten, wheat, and experimenting with various dietary approaches like vegetarian, vegan, paleo, and carnivore diets, all in an attempt to alleviate symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Medical testing and lack of solutions</strong> : Discussing the extensive and expensive medical testing he has undergone, Leo expresses dissatisfaction with the medical system's approach, which often dismisses his condition when standard thyroid medication fails to normalize his condition.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to cold</strong> : Beyond fatigue, Leo deals with an extreme sensitivity to cold temperatures, affecting his hands and feet, and further complicating his daily functioning.</li>
<li><strong>A journey of hope and acceptance</strong> : He conveys that despite the persistent search for answers, and decreasing hope, he is coming to terms with the possibility that his condition may be a lifelong challenge requiring acceptance rather than a solution.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of severe fatigue after meals</strong> : Since a significant episode of fatigue after a meal during a vacation in January 2020, Leo has experienced debilitating post-meal exhaustion, impeding his ability to function and contributing to his ongoing health saga.</li>
<li><strong>Struggle with video content production</strong> : Leo explains his inconsistency in releasing videos due to his chronic fatigue issues. He describes his efforts to rationalize the fatigue, fluctuating between attributing it to physical ailments like his diagnosed Hashimoto's disease and questioning if it might be psychological or a result of lifestyle choices.</li>
<li><strong>Debilitating post-meal fatigue</strong> : A significant turning point in his condition occurred during a vacation in January 2020 when he experienced overwhelming exhaustion after eating a regular meal. This level of fatigue became a daily occurrence, leading to hours of incapacitation and profound discomfort after every meal.</li>
<li><strong>Exacerbation from healthy foods</strong> : Leo's condition paradoxically worsens with the consumption of fruits and vegetables which he initially thought would be beneficial. His diet is now extremely restricted, heavily impacting his quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Medical tests and skepticism from professionals</strong> : Despite numerous medical tests and a clean endoscopy, doctors have suggested his symptoms might be imaginary, leaving him without solid answers and exhausted traditional medical avenues.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration of spiritual healing</strong> : Seeking alternatives, Leo consulted various psychics and spiritual healers, none of whom could offer concrete solutions to the root cause of his ailment. He details a particularly unique experience with a healer specializing in removing dark energies, which brought temporary mental clarity but no physical relief.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on life and work</strong> : Leo discusses the profound and pervasive impact of his health issues on every aspect of life. He confronts the limitation of manipulating his way out of this intractable problem, balancing efforts to find a remedy with the need to accept his condition.</li>
<li><strong>Experience with desert healer</strong> : Leo consulted a healer in the desert-a young man claiming to be a gifted spiritualist who could eradicate dark energies. The intensive three-hour session was a distinctive one-time experience that included engaging in spiritual exercises and Reiki-like healing. </li>
<li><strong>Promise of spiritual healing</strong> : The healer, confident in his spiritual abilities, assured Leo that in three months, the healing would integrate and his physical ailments would subside. The next day, Leo briefly felt an unprecedented clarity of mind, which was perceived as a substantial change beyond the placebo effect.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty about dark energies</strong> : While the healer perceived and announced the removal of dark entities, Leo was uncertain but open-minded about this assertion. He experienced no harmful effects but also no improvement in his stomach or fatigue issues.</li>
<li><strong>Reflecting on alternative treatments</strong> : Leo shares that despite his skepticism, he thinks people should consider alternative healing, especially if traditional medicine fails them. He highlights that while it did not solve his core health problems, he values the psychological clarity and knowledge gained from the experience.</li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic experience clarification</strong> : Leo clarifies misconceptions about his psychedelic use, emphasizing that his significant health issues existed before psychedelic exploration. Despite an intense experience with a high dose of 5-MeO-DMT causing temporary physical effects, he attests that he never observed any detrimental long-term physiological consequences from his infrequent and cautious usage of various substances.</li>
<li><strong>Causal complexity of health issues</strong> : He warns against oversimplifying and misattributing the root causes of conditions by blaming psychedelics without evidence, considering the complexity of factors involved, such as genetic predispositions to certain diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis that runs in his family.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific research on psychedelics</strong> : Leo points out the lack of credible scientific evidence linking psychedelics to chronic health issues like stomach problems or chronic fatigue, contradicting claims of physical harm from moderate psychedelic use.</li>
<li><strong>Personal empowerment through knowledge</strong> : As a seasoned explorer with over 100 psychedelic experiences, he trusts his direct experiences, which reveal no connections between psychedelics and his current health struggles. He further shares that psychedelics have provided relief from his suffering during his chronic health condition.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of 2020 and deteriorating health conditions</strong> : The past year, marked by deep suffering from health issues, has severely impacted his life. Personal setbacks include pervasive fatigue, depressed states resulting from physical discomfort, and a significant decrease in his ability to fulfill creative ambitions and maintain an active, normal life.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy for chronic suffering</strong> : Leo has developed a profound empathy and understanding for individuals with chronic health issues, recognizing the hardship of living with conditions that severely limit normal functioning. His own struggles have illuminated the challenges faced by those with incurable diseases who must navigate life with constant suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Work-life impact of chronic conditions</strong> : Leo considers how his flexibility in self-employment has been advantageous given his health, allowing for the adaptation of work to his fluctuating energy levels. He acknowledges that not everyone has this luxury and contemplates the difficulty of managing a traditional job alongside a chronic illness, especially for those with families that require additional energy and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Health as the foundation of life</strong> : He emphasizes the importance of maintaining good health and avoiding risky behaviors that can jeopardize well-being. Leo stresses that certain health issues cannot be meditated away and that understanding and compassion for those with health problems are crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of acceptance and surrender</strong> : Leo discusses the necessity of accepting what cannot be manipulated or changed, such as terminal illnesses and the inevitability of death. He points to surrender and acceptance as valuable lessons taught by life and suffering, promoting a healthier psychological approach to dealing with intractable problems.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of giving advice on complex issues</strong> : After experiencing his own complex health journey, Leo has gained insight into the intricacies of giving advice. He recognizes the diversity of potential causes for conditions like chronic fatigue and depression, advocating for careful consideration and a personalized approach to solving such issues.</li>
<li><strong>Letting go in situations beyond control</strong> : Leo reflects on the importance of letting go in life situations that are beyond control, highlighting that one's instinct to manipulate outcomes must eventually yield to acceptance. He connects this to broader life experiences, including relationship breakdowns, job loss, and societal challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging in conscious suffering</strong> : Leo discusses how life's adversities, including his own health struggles, are harsh yet potent catalysts for personal growth and empathy. He explores the idea that to truly empathize with others, one must live through similar hardships. These experiences could serve as pathways to deeper compassion and effectiveness in teaching and spreading love.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy's role in societal change</strong> : He emphasizes the need for society to not only empathize with victims but also with perpetrators, as the latter often act out their own wounds. True societal progress involves extending understanding to those who seem incapable of empathy, such as abusers or the elite, recognizing that they too have their own histories of suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond stage green to tier two consciousness</strong> : Leo highlights the importance of moving past stage green's tendency to have enemies like the elite or conservatives. He proposes a holistic approach where society's aim is to heal and elevate all individuals' consciousness, including those who cause harm. This transcends into the tier two level of consciousness, which integrates tolerance, empathy, and the elimination of enemy constructs for the greater good.</li>
<li><strong>Interconnectedness of society's issues</strong> : Leo underscores the karmic nature of societal problems, such as drug abuse leading to car break-ins, to illustrate how we are all interconnected. By experiencing oneself the consequences of ignoring others' sufferings, like drug-related crimes personally affecting one, it becomes clear that addressing problems like PTSD, addiction, or homelessness can ultimately benefit all.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for holistic social healing systems</strong> : Discussing the soon-to-be-approved use of MDMA for treating PTSD and psychological trauma, Leo proposes a vision for societal institutions that help individuals with various problems. This framework suggests a compassionate society capable of addressing the root causes of issues like addiction and trauma, which in turn could reduce related systemic issues such as crime.</li>
<li><strong>Conscious suffering as a path to empathy</strong> : Leo reflects on the importance of consciously experiencing suffering to develop genuine empathy, rather than becoming bitter or blaming others. Conscious suffering can lead to a deeper understanding between individuals and the building of a more compassionate society.</li>
<li><strong>Life's hardships as love lessons</strong> : Leo considers that life's challenges, including his, may serve as a means to develop greater love and teach others to love more effectively. He acknowledges his privilege and how experiencing personal hardship can result in a broader empathy for those facing suffering, advancing one's journey as a conscious leader.</li>
<li><strong>Awakening through adversity</strong> : Leo conveys the idea that adversity and suffering can prompt significant inner growth, leading people to reevaluate their lives, cultivate gratitude, and escape complacency. Suffering is the true test of love, revealing who we are at our core and urging us to rise to a higher purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of life-threatening events</strong> : Citing a near-fatal car accident he survived, Leo illustrates how such a brush with death can invoke profound existential reflection on how one is using their life. These events emphasize the importance of not taking life for granted and reassessing one's life purposes and commitments.</li>
