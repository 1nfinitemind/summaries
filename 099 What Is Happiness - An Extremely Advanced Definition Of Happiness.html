            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5WSlkzz2_Bk' target='_blank'>What Is Happiness - An Extremely Advanced Definition Of Happiness</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Clarifying the notion of happiness</strong> : Leo aims to provide a deeper understanding of happiness by differentiating it from the commonly mistaken concept of excitement. He intends to clarify the real meaning of happiness as most people don't actually experience it, leading them to continually seek something more in life. </li>
<li><strong>Happiness versus excitement</strong> : Leo makes a distinction between happiness, which he describes as a peaceful, calm, and content state of being, and excitement, which is often mistaken for happiness and includes activities such as eating at a fine restaurant or going on a rollercoaster. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of excitement confused for happiness</strong> : Commonly, people consider the pleasure from eating favorite foods, having great sex, or engaging in thrilling activities as happiness. However, Leo argues these are forms of excitement that give temporary pleasure. </li>
<li><strong>Seeking stimulation through excitement</strong> : He criticizes the tendency to chase after stimulation, arguing that people believe they will achieve a constant state of happiness by locking in these peaks of excitement, which is a mistaken belief. </li>
<li><strong>Excitement as an unconscious form of living</strong> : Leo describes the pursuit of excitement through stimulating activities, relationships, and hobbies as an unconscious form of living akin to addiction, which ultimately hinders personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of genuine happiness</strong> : Leo posits genuine happiness as a fulfilling state of peace and calm without reliance on external stimulation. It is characterized by contentment with the present moment, free of suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Excitement vs fulfillment</strong> : Leo challenges the listener to reconsider their definition of happiness, which is often associated with the excitement of novel experiences, and understand that true fulfillment comes from inner peace rather than external stimuli. </li>
<li><strong>Ego-driven pursuit of happiness</strong> : According to Leo, the ego keeps people chasing an illusion of happiness through external means, which inevitably leads to a cycle of highs and lows rather than lasting contentment. </li>
<li><strong>Real fulfillment after excitement</strong> : Leo suggests that real happiness is the peaceful feeling after the end of an exciting episode. He encourages viewers to reflect on whether they have truly achieved lasting fulfillment through their pursuits or are simply riding a rollercoaster of temporary excitement. </li>
<li><strong>Contentment as genuine happiness</strong> : He advocates for a state of happiness rooted in peace, contentment, and the absence of suffering, which can seem less appealing compared to the thrill of excitement but offers true and lasting fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Perpetual Cycle of Stimulation Seeking</strong> : Leo discusses how the brain constantly seeks the next source of excitement, creating a sense of emptiness when alone and quiet, leading to an addictive pattern that hinders genuine happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Created Roller Coaster of Emotion</strong> : He emphasizes that individuals create their own cycles of highs and lows through their constant search for external stimulation, which contrasts with the advanced personal development perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment and Ego Dissolution</strong> : Leo proposes that true happiness involves deep work on oneself, researching enlightenment, and engaging in meditation and introspection to dissolve the ego, leading to a natural state of fulfillment without the need for stimulation. </li>
<li><strong>Natural State of Peace and Fulfillment</strong> : It is suggested that our inherent state is one of complete peace and fulfillment, but this is obscured by our addictions to stimulation and the ego's focus on survival and reproduction. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Exercise for Understanding Addiction to Stimulation</strong> : Leo advises to undertake an exercise of sitting in isolation without distractions for two hours to observe one's own mental and physical withdrawal symptoms, paralleling substance addiction, and to gain insight into one's dependency on external stimulation. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging the Ego-Driven Unfulfillment</strong> : Through introspection and recognition of dissatisfaction with life's current state as driven by the ego, individuals can begin the journey toward dismantling their ego and experiencing true happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Invitation to Continue the Enlightenment Journey</strong> : Leo invites viewers to anticipate more content on self-fulfillment and enlightenment and recommends signing up for the Actualized.org newsletter for additional resources on overcoming limiting beliefs and receiving coaching.</li>
