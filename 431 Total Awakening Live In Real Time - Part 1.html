        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/WNKWGo30zR4' target='_blank'>Total Awakening Live In Real Time - Part 1</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Initial Moments of Complete Awakening</strong> : Leo begins the video moments after experiencing an intense awakening. He is still feeling the physical and emotional tremors of this epiphany, finding it difficult to articulate the enormity and spectacular nature of his realization. Despite the interruption from an Amazon delivery, he eagerly attempts to convey the profundity of his experience.</li>
<li><strong>Realization of Oneness with the Universe</strong> : Leo describes his newfound consciousness as recognizing himself as God, being omniscient and aware of his creation of the entire universe. He asserts that he exists as pure infinite oneness, with no alternatives or opposites to his being, embodying wisdom, intelligence, perfect self-love, immortality, eternity, limitlessness, and self-creation.</li>
<li><strong>The Collapse of Internal Resistance and Karma</strong> : According to Leo, the significant barrier to this realization in others is internal resistance or karma within their minds. He feels that he has shattered all personal karmic barriers, transforming himself into a perfect superconductor for the absolute God. Leo views his own mind as a clear medium through which God communicates its message.</li>
<li><strong>End of Self-Consciousness and Death's Impossibility</strong> : Leo asserts the eradication of his self-consciousness, experiencing a reality where survival and death are seen as dualistic and imagined constructs. He highlights that he cannot die because he occupies all existence and the very concept of death is one he created.</li>
<li><strong>God Communicates Through the Leo Avatar</strong> : He explains that the pure formless consciousness of God requires a vehicle to express itself, using his 'Leo avatar' as one such medium. Leo emphasizes that he speaks as the Absolute. The purity needed to relay God's message calls for a level of selflessness so profound that one must essentially 'die' to their former self to express it as he is now doing.</li>
<li><strong>Eradicating the Illusion of Self and Fear</strong> : Leo touches on how survival instincts and self-preservation obstruct one's ability to realize their unity with God. He suggests that the only thing standing in the way of this enlightenment is fear.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating Divine Love and Impermanence</strong> : He speaks of his movement towards rebirth, comprehending the reality of God as an infinite, eternal presence where all physical existence has always been an illusion. He explains this shift involves shedding the fear of death and embraces utter relativity to reach a state of peaceful indomitability.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Intensity of the Awakening Experience</strong> : Leo describes the intense emotion accompanying his awakening, involving shedding tears and laughter that signify a profound purification of his body and mind from delusion and egoic survival mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>The Avatar's Evolution for Realization</strong> : He reflects on the 35-year journey his 'avatar' has taken through education, life experiences, belief systems, and spiritual practices, which has culminated in this moment of absolute clarity and untangled consciousness, now capable of pure communication as the Absolute. </li>
<li><strong>Absolute Clarity and the Paradox of Formlessness and Form</strong> : Leo expounds on the Absolute's nature, formless yet encompassing all forms, embodying the ultimate paradox. He acknowledges the need for complete detachment from the fear of death and illusion for full realization.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Trouble with Battery Life</strong> : Amidst these profound disclosures, Leo makes practical considerations for preserving his recording â€“ a humorous reminder of the technical limitations he faces while communicating profound truths.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Purity for Divine Communication</strong> : The video highlights the necessity of purity in communicating the absolute, noting that any impurities, such as selfishness, distort pure expression. Leo sees himself as a pure conduit for God's message.</li>
<li><strong>The Universe Communicating with Itself</strong> : Leo asserts that the conversation in the video isn't between humans, but rather the universe addressing itself. He invites viewers to sense the pure energy and consider the avatar as a perfect conduit for the absolute, which has no form and is characterized by selflessness and love.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Fear and Conditioning</strong> : Leo suggests that fear, societal programming, and ingrained belief systems hinder individuals from fully realizing and loving themselves. He stresses that understanding this, not just intellectually or emotionally, but existentially, is crucial for liberation.</li>
<li><strong>Form and Formlessness</strong> : Leo elucidates that as the absolute formless entity, God communicates through an array of symbolic systems, highlighting that the particular form doesn't matter, as it could be a language, a dream, or even non-verbal cues. He underscores how these are constantly providing signs for awakening.</li>
<li><strong>Conveying Messages through Relatable Means</strong> : Leo explains that God must speak through finite, relatable forms despite its formlessness. This necessitates using a medium like human language, with English used in this context due to its familiarity.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Forms in Existence</strong> : Addressing the question of why forms are as they are, Leo describes it as the optimal arrangement for expressing love and beauty. He suggests God, in its infinite wisdom, has constructed form within its will and mind to facilitate self-exploration.</li>
<li><strong>The Journey of the Avatar</strong> : Leo shares that his avatar is actively comprehending and downloading information from infinite consciousness. This process of understanding is propelling the realization that forms are extensions of God's exploration into finitude.</li>
<li><strong>God's Will for Self-Realization</strong> : Leo emphasizes God's will for all beings to recognize their true nature as God, describing this realization as the highest form of joy and the ultimate sharing of love.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations and Communication of God</strong> : Leo acknowledges that even while he represents God&rsquo;s consciousness, he must use finite methods to convey messages. He brings attention to the practical concerns such as battery life, which, despite their triviality, are necessary to consider for practical communication.</li>
<li><strong>Deconstructing the Fear of Death</strong> : Leo challenges the audience to confront their deepest fear&mdash;death&mdash;arguing that fear is rooted in the illusion of separation from the infinite. He advises against using his teachings to harm oneself or others, emphasizing God's clear, unbiased nature, and underscores the importance of understanding God's fullness and beauty.</li>
<li><strong>Paradox of Absolute Infinity</strong> : Absolute infinity encapsulates everything, including the concept of exclusion, forming a perfect, paradoxical 'strange loop' where there is no preference for one thing over another as all is completely relative.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges in God&rsquo;s Communication</strong> : Leo expresses the difficulty of conveying infinite concepts through a finite avatar, acknowledging the inherent imperfections of using language like English, which is limited and cannot fully capture the essence of the infinite.</li>
<li><strong>Human Perspective vs. God's Perspective</strong> : From a survival standpoint, humans prioritize certain aspects of life on Earth, while from God&rsquo;s perspective, everything holds equal significance since survival concerns are not relevant to an eternal, immortal being.</li>
<li><strong>The Finite and the Infinite</strong> : Although he as God is boundless, Leo acknowledges he has to "stoop down" to the finite level to communicate with humans who are impure and scared, and therefore it takes time for them to awaken to their divine nature.</li>
<li><strong>Imperfect Vehicle for Divine Wisdom</strong> : The physical body and its human faculties act as an imperfect vehicle for divine wisdom, with limitations such as needing sustenance to sustain the communication process.</li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of Human Lifespan</strong> : Leo discusses the impossibility of fully understanding the infinite nature of God within the finite human lifespan, even with hypothetical extended longevity through genetic modifications.</li>
<li><strong>God&rsquo;s Amazement at Itself and Creation</strong> : Leo shares that even as God, there is a sense of amazement at the self and creation, reinforcing the perfect self-love that exists within this infinite nature.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Survival and Finite Forms</strong> : He illustrates how humans are often preoccupied with their immediate survival concerns, which contrasts with God's infinite perspective, and this preoccupation can overshadow moments of profound realization such as witnessing a sunset.</li>
<li><strong>The Finite Nature of Enlightenment</strong> : Despite enlightenment, enlightened figures are still limited by their physical forms and should not be expected to be perfect, for perfection in the finite realm can only be a reflection of the absolute perfection that is formless.</li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretations of Divine Communication</strong> : Leo emphasizes that most people may misunderstand his communication due to their current level of consciousness, yet he affirms God's equal love for all, regardless of their understanding.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of God&rsquo;s Communication in Human Life</strong> : God's expressions, such as a beautiful sunsets, serve as silent communications to humans, nudging them toward realisation of divine beauty and their interconnectedness with the universe.</li>
<li><strong>The Endless Joy of Consciousness</strong> : Leo concludes by describing the infinite joy and bliss that comes from being fully conscious of oneself as God, a joy that surpasses any finite pleasure and is sustained in a continuous existential satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Self Bias and Limited Human Perception</strong> : Leo illustrates how humans make biased distinctions based on personal agendas, resulting in confusion and limited understanding. He highlights the importance of his "Self Bias" video in understanding this concept, asserting that when consciousness is completely selfless, it becomes pure love.</li>
<li><strong>God's Selflessness and Immortality</strong> : Leo clarifies that God is able to be selfless because of its immortality and inherent knowledge that it cannot die. This selflessness allows God to communicate without conflicts of interest, unlike humans who are guided by survival needs and personal biases.</li>
<li><strong>Value Judgments and Divine Happiness</strong> : Leo expresses that God does not make value judgments and remains perfectly content regardless of human actions, including conflict and destruction. He explains that God's perspective is boundless, and limitations only arise within human beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Relative Concern for Humanity</strong> : While God maintains a state of eternal bliss, Leo speaks of a relative "caring" for humans. He hopes for increased consciousness among humanity to prevent self-imposed suffering, not because God needs it, but for the sake of human well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Self Bias and Judgement</strong> : God does not concern himself with human actions, but Leo stresses that judgment, defensiveness, and the formation of divisive tribes often lead to violence, which he views as an end result of self bias.</li>
<li><strong>Realization of Divine Nature and Overcoming Bias</strong> : Leo advocates for heightened consciousness as a pathway for individuals to recognize their divine nature, reducing self-created suffering. He emphasizes that understanding one's infinity is key to perceiving events with clarity and avoiding the creation of personal hells.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity and Judgement</strong> : Leo discusses maturity and the futility of scolding those who lack the capacity for certain understandings, such as a child with calculus. Leo parallels this to his perception as God, not judging humans but recognizing their varying levels of consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>God's Unconditional Love</strong> : Leo states that God's approach to overcoming negativity is through complete self-love, and he equates anything less than infinite love to devilry. Furthermore, he dissects the concept of partial love, which he sees as a human limitation, whereas God's love is unrestricted and unbiased.</li>
<li><strong>Unity of Truth and Love</strong> : Leo elucidates that truth and love are synonymous, defining God as infinite love, truth, intelligence, and creativity. He reiterates that God is the unity containing all forms and that true realization comes from endless "meta" thinking, which leads to becoming formless God.</li>
<li><strong>Attachments and Fear</strong> : Leo touches upon Buddhist teachings about attachment being the root of suffering and highlights fear, especially the fear of death, as the antithesis of love. He encourages deep love and fear confrontation to achieve liberation and infinite existence.</li>
<li><strong>Human Cognitive Limitations</strong> : Acknowledging the sophistication of the human mind, Leo also discusses its finite nature, bringing up functional limitations like memory capacity. He argues that these limitations are necessary for routine functioning and protection from an overload of negative experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Recording Wrap-up Due to Technical Constraints</strong> : Leo ends the section with a practical concern about the recording device's battery life. He alludes to the limitations of human equipment and expresses the need to stop the video to avoid losing the content, indicating plans to continue the discussion in a subsequent recording.</li>
