            <ul>
    <li><b>Inconsistency in meditation practice</b>: Leo experienced difficulty with focus and selecting a meditation technique to stick with, which led to feelings of laziness and underachievement based on his prior expectations from years of practice.
</li><li><b>Dealing with drowsiness</b>: Frequent drowsiness impacted Leo's ability to maintain lengthy meditation sessions. He chose to focus on meditating when feeling most awake rather than adhering to a strict sleep schedule, attributing sleepiness to potential jet lag.
</li><li><b>Developing momentum with labeling</b>: By forcing himself to practice labeling, despite an initial reluctance, Leo began to build momentum in this technique, which he hopes to carry into the following days of the retreat.
</li><li><b>Acclimatization to retreat settings</b>: Adjusting to the new surroundings of the retreat, including the colder–than–expected nights, was a learning experience for Leo. He emphasized the need to adapt quickly to different environments when on retreats.
</li><li><b>Choosing between multiple techniques</b>: Leo expressed a conundrum regarding the abundance of meditation techniques he knows, causing indecision and distraction. He contemplates sticking to one technique but doubts his ability to commit to only one throughout the retreat.
</li><li><b>The goal of heightened awareness</b>: The retreat's purpose is to fine–tune Leo's sensitivity to minute sensations and details around him. By increasing mindfulness, he aims to move deeper into questions of self and reality from a place of enhanced perceptual acuity rather than intellectual thought.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment through deliberate practice</b>: Leo reiterates his goal of enlightenment, acknowledging that although there is an element of chance to awakening, committed and intentional practice significantly increases the chances of transformative experiences, contrary to the passive approach advised by some.
</li><li><b>Preparation versus luck analogy</b>: He compares the pursuit of enlightenment to preparing for a successful fishing trip: effort and preparation can significantly increase the likelihood of success, but the actual moment of enlightenment, much like catching a fish, involves a stroke of luck.
