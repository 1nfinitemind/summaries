        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/zxMTekwz1HM' target='_blank'>Whatever Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger - True or False</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Validity of the adage</strong> : Leo discusses whether the saying "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger" holds true or if it's possible to be emotionally crippled by extreme challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Personal legal trial experience</strong> : Leo uses his intense emotional experience during a legal trial in Toronto as a context to explore the adage's meaning and reflect on its impact on his emotional state. </li>
<li><strong>Short-term damage from life choices</strong> : He acknowledges that difficult experiences, especially poor decisions, can short-term lead to self-doubt, fear, retreat, and an inability to live life to the fullest. </li>
<li><strong>Persistent scars from bad decisions</strong> : Leo contemplates whether such experiences can hinder someone's performance in the immediate and medium-term, possibly leading to a retreat from life's opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Strength through suffering</strong> : He cites examples like addiction, financial scams, and personal loss as scenarios that, though initially painful, can foster growth and ultimately strengthen character. </li>
<li><strong>Reshaping identity after hardship</strong> : Leo asserts that while nobody wishes for trauma, catastrophic failures have the potential to redefine a person and inspire new motivations, leading to appreciation and gratitude. </li>
<li><strong>Mental resilience like callouses</strong> : He likens psychological resilience built through hardship to callouses formed on skin, which make it less sensitive and more robust to future wear and tear. </li>
<li><strong>Smooth-sailing lives and lack of resilience</strong> : Contrasting tough experiences, Leo warns that individuals with seemingly perfect lives lack the resilience that comes from overcoming adversity and may crumble if met with sudden challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Success from hardship</strong> : He points out that many influential figures have endured hardships and these struggles have armed them with the mental toughness to handle life's worst. </li>
<li><strong>Gratitude for past hardships</strong> : Leo encourages viewing traumatic events from the past as valuable, foundational experiences for building a grand life, fostering personal growth and resilience. </li>
<li><strong>Staying course through adversity</strong> : He advises to persist through challenges without giving up, and to reflect on traumatic experiences as platforms for growth, indicating that a true strength can emerge from such trials. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a personal growth resource</strong> : Leo invites viewers to join Actualized.org to receive continuous content on self-actualization, emphasizing the importance of learning and applying concepts for life transformation.</li>
