            <ul>
    <li><b>Validity of the adage</b>: Leo discusses whether the saying "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger" holds true or if it's possible to be emotionally crippled by extreme challenges.
</li><li><b>Personal legal trial experience</b>: Leo uses his intense emotional experience during a legal trial in Toronto as a context to explore the adage's meaning and reflect on its impact on his emotional state.
</li><li><b>Short–term damage from life choices</b>: He acknowledges that difficult experiences, especially poor decisions, can short–term lead to self–doubt, fear, retreat, and an inability to live life to the fullest.
</li><li><b>Persistent scars from bad decisions</b>: Leo contemplates whether such experiences can hinder someone's performance in the immediate and medium–term, possibly leading to a retreat from life's opportunities.
</li><li><b>Strength through suffering</b>: He cites examples like addiction, financial scams, and personal loss as scenarios that, though initially painful, can foster growth and ultimately strengthen character.
</li><li><b>Reshaping identity after hardship</b>: Leo asserts that while nobody wishes for trauma, catastrophic failures have the potential to redefine a person and inspire new motivations, leading to appreciation and gratitude.
</li><li><b>Mental resilience like callouses</b>: He likens psychological resilience built through hardship to callouses formed on skin, which make it less sensitive and more robust to future wear and tear.
</li><li><b>Smooth–sailing lives and lack of resilience</b>: Contrasting tough experiences, Leo warns that individuals with seemingly perfect lives lack the resilience that comes from overcoming adversity and may crumble if met with sudden challenges.
</li><li><b>Success from hardship</b>: He points out that many influential figures have endured hardships and these struggles have armed them with the mental toughness to handle life's worst.
</li><li><b>Gratitude for past hardships</b>: Leo encourages viewing traumatic events from the past as valuable, foundational experiences for building a grand life, fostering personal growth and resilience.
</li><li><b>Staying course through adversity</b>: He advises to persist through challenges without giving up, and to reflect on traumatic experiences as platforms for growth, indicating that a true strength can emerge from such trials.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a personal growth resource</b>: Leo invites viewers to join Actualized.org to receive continuous content on self–actualization, emphasizing the importance of learning and applying concepts for life transformation.
