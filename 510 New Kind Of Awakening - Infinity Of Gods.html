            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/skoXFwOxTIk' target='_blank'>New Kind Of Awakening - Infinity Of Gods</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>New Level of Awakening Experience</b>: Leo asserts that he has attained a new depth in his awakening experiences, with the latest uncovering an even profounder form of solipsism, an ongoing theme throughout his spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Solipsistic Integration</b>: Leo expresses the difficulty of integrating solipsistic awakenings into ordinary life and how, despite previous successes, there was an underlying sense that his understanding was incomplete.
</li><li><b>Reevaluation and Disproof of Past Awakenings</b>: He emphasis the importance of questioning one's deepest awakenings to avoid self–deception, approaching his most recent awakening with the mindset of disproving it to arrive at a deeper truth.
</li><li><b>Resetting Conceptual Beliefs</b>: Leo describes a process of discarding all preconceptions about awakening to approach the inquiry from a state of profound non–knowing, emphasizing the benefit of occasionally wiping the slate clean to prevent past ideas from coloring future insights.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Arrogance and Self–Deception</b>: He acknowledges the danger of spiritual arrogance, where one's extensive spiritual experiences might lead to a false belief that nothing more could be missing, and how this can become a trap for individuals on their spiritual path.
</li><li><b>Confronting Fear for Deeper Insight</b>: Leo reflects on the realization that deeper understanding is often locked behind a profound, primordial fear. He stresses that one must face their fears in order to discover greater truths about reality and the self.
</li><li><b>Inability to Disprove Solipsism</b>: In his attempt to delve deeper, he concludes that his solipsistic experiences cannot be disproven, leading to a reaffirmation of his understanding of being in an absolute state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Absolute Sovereignty of Consciousness</b>: Confronted with the impossibility of disproving solipsism, Leo finds himself in a "god mode" state of consciousness, contemplating the nature of God and the absolute sovereignty of consciousness, acknowledging that reality or God has no external limitations or authorities.
</li><li><b>Sovereignty and Absolute Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura explains that contemplation of sovereignty helps one to face the reality of being absolutely sovereign. This awareness was a focal point during his awakening experience, reinforcing his understanding that one cannot escape or transcend their own consciousness, which is absolute and everything.
</li><li><b>Insight into Multiple Sovereign Consciousnesses</b>: An unexpected insight struck Leo that suggested the existence of other sovereign consciousnesses, existing independently as though in separate dimensions. Despite initial skepticism, he concluded that absolute sovereignty implies the potential for infinitely many sovereign entities, completely disconnected from each other.
</li><li><b>Realization of Infinite Gods</b>: Leo came to the realization that if he, as God, is absolutely sovereign, then infinite other gods–each with uppercase 'G' representing their absoluteness–could exist, forever separated and performing their own unique acts. This was a new conceptual frontier for him that contradicted his previous understanding. 
</li><li><b>Paradox of Knowing and Not Knowing Other Gods</b>: Leo grapples with the paradox of being God who is conscious that other gods may exist, yet also aware that he can never actually know or validate their existence due to being locked within his own sovereign consciousness. He describes this understanding as a divine logic intrinsic to God's nature.
</li><li><b>Attempt to Connect with Another God</b>: Considering himself unlimited, Leo decides to initiate a connection with another absolute sovereign consciousness. He sends out an intention to connect beyond the edges of his consciousness, forming what feels like a telepathic bond where both consciousnesses instantly recognize their awakeness.
</li><li><b>Experiencing a Telepathic Connection</b>: The connection Leo formed seemed real, and the entity he connected with appeared to be a sovereign consciousness like his own. They shared insights and recognized their limitations in knowing the true nature of the connection due to their respective sovereignties.
</li><li><b>Ecstatic Realization of Not Knowing</b>: The uncertainty about whether the connection was real or imaginary led both Leo and the other consciousness to a state of ecstatic bliss, accepting the impossibility of knowing anything outside one's own consciousness. This realization felt akin to metaphysical intimacy with God.
</li><li><b>Compatibility of the Connection with Solipsism</b>: Leo clarifies that the connection with another god does not refute solipsism because any other entity he connects with is ultimately part of his own consciousness. He describes the process as a next level of solipsism, where apparent connections with others deepen solipsism by being absorbed into his own consciousness.
</li><li><b>Expanding Consciousness</b>: Infinite consciousness operates like a shock wave expanding through space, where any 'other' becomes part of the self upon discovery. The more one awakens, the closer they ride the wave's edge, incorporating everything it touches into itself.
</li><li><b>Fractal Nature of God</b>: Leo conceives God as an infinite fractal, a series of nested singularities where each 'godhead' encapsulates infinity and layers of gods within. Recognizing oneself as God implies acknowledging an endless number of gods within.
</li><li><b>The Paradox of Infinite Gods</b>: The multiplicity of gods and their capacity for individual dreams while maintaining their foundational nature as infinity introduces profound paradoxes which are integral features of such awakenings.
</li><li><b>Telepathic Connection and Collective Dreaming</b>: Leo speculates about sovereign godheads choosing to connect, telepathically merging into a meta godhead which has the potential to dream collectively, akin to players in a shared multiplayer game forsaking some sovereignty for connection and experience.
</li><li><b>Risk of Losing Sovereignty in a Collective Dream</b>: By limiting their own infinite nature to participate in a collective dream and create a sense of 'other', individual godheads risk forgetting their ultimate sovereignty, possibly leading to a loss of awareness within the shared dream.
</li><li><b>Hints for Awakening</b>: Awakened individuals can drop hints for others' avatars, acting as guides for the godhead behind the avatar. The recognition of these hints depends upon the level of consciousness and awakening within each individual.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Recognizing the Divine in Everyone</b>: Leo explains his own challenge in the collective dream to maintain awareness of his true self while recognizing and fostering the divine potential in others, even when they exhibit negative behavior.
</li><li><b>Seeing Highest Potential in Others</b>: The practical application is to see and assist in actualizing everyone's highest potential, regardless of their present actions or circumstances. This empathetic perspective enriches life markedly but requires substantial awareness and awakening.
</li><li><b>Assuming Sovereignty and Encouraging Growth</b>: Respecting the inherent sovereignty of every individual leads to a life of empathy and respect. Recognizing everyone as sovereign entities encourages us to treat them with dignity, fostering an environment of growth and flourishing across various avatars.
</li><li><b>Negative Feelings as Misinterpretation</b>: Experiencing bitterness or depression during awakening may indicate a misconception of one's experiences. Genuine awakening should enhance feelings of love, connection, and peace. 
</li><li><b>Continuous Growth in Awakening</b>: Leo underlines the continuous nature of awakening, advising against complacency and promoting ongoing exploration for new insights and deeper love.
</li><li><b>Ego's pursuit of sovereignty</b>: Leo discusses how the ego's desire for things like wealth, love, and success is not merely due to selfishness but is a dysfunctional attempt to achieve its true nature as a fragment of God seeking full sovereignty.
</li><li><b>Understanding ego and conflict</b>: He explains that all conflicts, violence, and oppression occur when one limited identity controlled by ego attempts to dominate another, failing to recognize each other's equal sovereignty as aspects of God.
</li><li><b>Real sovereignty</b>: Leo's awakening brings the insight that recognizing one's own sovereignty also involves acknowledging the sovereignty of others without diminishing one's own – suggesting true sovereignty means allowing the existence of other sovereign beings.
</li><li><b>Infinity and abundance</b>: Describing God as a "magic hat" of infinite abundance, he speaks about the infinite potential within each person and the importance of helping others realize they are also part of this limitless source.
</li><li><b>Finite versus infinite paradigm</b>: Leo contrasts the finite paradigm of scarcity and competition with the infinite paradigm of awakening to the truth of abundant potential, where no one needs to manipulate or harm others.
</li><li><b>Respecting sovereignty in everyday life</b>: He suggests a practical application of respecting others' sovereignty, which would fundamentally change how one interacts socially and reduce manipulation and conflict.
</li><li><b>Awakening thought process</b>: Leo clarifies that his elaboration on sovereignty, God, and interrelations is a thought process within his own consciousness, reinforcing his solipsistic view that nothing exists outside his consciousness – this is his dream, and it's all there is.
</li><li><b>God as a holographic concept</b>: He expands on the idea of God's infinite holography, indicating that even if God is divided into infinite parts, each one fully contains the wholeness of God.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing this awakening from others</b>: He notes the difference from previous awakenings in the depth of connection and love experienced, illustrating that true solipsism doesn't lead to disconnection but to unity and infinite love.
</li><li><b>Aloneness versus togetherness in awakening</b>: Leo contrasts the focus on aloneness in solipsism with the potential for togetherness and connection, arguing that recognizing the imagined 'other' as part of oneself leads to deeper relationships than the materialistic worldview allows.
</li><li><b>Misconception of Materialism</b>: Materialism creates a sense of separation and disconnection that can lead to despair. In contrast, awakening offers the experience of unity and the possibility of metaphysically merging with anything in the universe, which is uplifting rather than nihilistic.
</li><li><b>Awakening Experience Rooted in Love</b>: The entire process of awakening is described as an evolution of love, with each realization deepening Leo's self–love and expanding his capacity for connection and unity with all forms of life.
</li><li><b>Solipsism and Deep Connection</b>: This interpretation of solipsism is not isolating but allows for a profound sense of connection and love. Understanding that other beings are part of oneself enables a unity that leads to the highest levels of love–godly and infinite.
</li><li><b>Teaching Awakening as Natural Progression</b>: Leo now sees more reason to teach awakening, viewing it as a natural action for consciousness to help other consciousness awaken, even if it's all within the solipsistic dream.
</li><li><b>Solipsism as a Dream</b>: Initially, realizing life as a dream might be disappointing, but fully integrating this insight leads to embracing the illusory nature of reality, which can enhance one's enjoyment and appreciation of the dream–like experience.
</li><li><b>Integration and Enjoyment of Life</b>: Accepting life's dream–like quality allows one to enjoy experiences like movies or video games more deeply, knowing they are unreal yet appreciating them without feeling deceived.
</li><li><b>Love and Connection as Solipsistic Realization</b>: Leo stresses that solipsism does not negate connection; Love and connection are realizations that others are part of one's self, dissolving perceived separateness and leading to unity and godly love.
</li><li><b>Real and Imaginary Connections in Awakening</b>: Leo clarifies that all connections are essentially imaginary since they are connections with oneself, and this recognition is what love truly is–an infinite self–connection dissolving differences.
</li><li><b>Identifying True Solipsism</b>: A true solipsistic awakening is characterized by an overwhelming sense of love and connection; if one feels negative about solipsistic realizations, these feelings are misinterpretations and an indicator of a shallow level of realization.
</li><li><b>Practical Connections and Integration</b>: Leo advises seeking profound metaphysical connections, understanding they are imaginary and embracing this fact. Integration of these awakenings involves repeated work and confronting illusions.
</li><li><b>Emotional Challenges in Awakening</b>: Feeling negative emotions during awakening, such as depression or cynicism, signals a misunderstanding or incomplete integration of insights. Leo recommends examining and adjusting one's spiritual journey accordingly.
</li><li><b>Awakening Involves Love and Awe</b>: Proper awakening should lead towards love, connection, peace, joy, and amazement at the structure of reality, rather than feelings of hate, loneliness, or fear. If such negative emotions arise, one should re–evaluate their understanding of awakening.
</li><li><b>Criteria for Genuine Awakening</b>: Leo Gura identifies the signs of genuine spiritual awakening as feelings of love, awe, wonder, wholeness, and connection, accompanied by compassion and forgiveness towards others. He emphasizes that bitterness or negativity suggests one might need to reevaluate their spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Navigating Negative States</b>: Leo advises those stuck in negative solipsistic spirals to either take a break and enjoy ordinary life or to introspect and question their beliefs, possibly adjusting their spiritual practices to aim for a deeper and more holistic awakening experience.
</li><li><b>Doubting One's Awakening</b>: Leo stresses that true awakening leaves no room for doubt as it is characterized by absolute consciousness and truth. If doubts persist, one is encouraged to deepen their spiritual work and to not get attached to any particular ideas or experiences.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic Path to Awakening</b>: Leo discusses using psychedelics as a tool for awakening and the importance of carefully integrating and questioning these experiences. He advises against getting overly attached to ideas from psychedelic trips and recommends trying to invalidate past awakenings to build a solid understanding.
</li><li><b>Scientific Approach to Psychedelics and Awakening</b>: Leo draws a parallel between science and the use of psychedelics, outlining that both seek the truth through rigorous testing. He suggests that like in scientific inquiry, one should remain open to challenging and potentially disproving their insights for more profound understanding.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Facing Fear</b>: Pointing out the potential for self–delusion, Leo emphasizes the need to confront fears during the psychedelic and awakening process. He explains that the truth will withstand skepticism, and understanding replaces fear with love, indicating correct process engagement.
</li><li><b>Ongoing Nature of Awakening</b>: Leo concludes by highlighting the continuous and evolving nature of awakening, urging individuals to remain open to new insights and experiences, and never to consider themselves "done" with the journey toward deeper truths and love.
