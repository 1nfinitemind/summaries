        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/g4A7SBx-CEg' target='_blank'>Holism & Holistic Thinking - Part 2</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Aberrations of the human mind are to a large extent due to the obsessional<br />
pursuit of some part-truth, treated as if it were the whole truth." - Arthur<br />
Koestler</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holistic thinking definition and importance</strong> : Holistic thinking encompasses understanding the interconnectedness of various life domains. Adopting this perspective can lead to solutions for problems perceived as insurmountable through a reductionist lens. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of lack of holistic thinking</strong> : Environmental degradation, such as pollution and overfishing, and the introduction of invasive species like weasels in Hawaii, demonstrate the consequences of not considering ecological interconnections. </li>
<li><strong>Unholistic approach in Western medicine</strong> : Leo's personal health experiences highlight the compartmentalization and lack of holistic thinking in Western medicine, leading to unsatisfactory patient care and outcomes. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of nutrition on theoretical physics</strong> : Leo posits that nutrition significantly impacts a scientist's cognitive abilities to develop and understand theories, pointing out the non-holistic tendency to detach personal nutrition from professional scientific work. </li>
<li><strong>Collective and personal problems from non-holistic perspectives</strong> : Society and individuals face issues like environmental harm and personal health challenges due to a lack of holistic approaches in thinking and decision-making. </li>
<li><strong>Personal fasting experience impacting perspective</strong> : During a 14-day water fast, Leo notices changes in his cognitive functions and uses this personal experience to illustrate the direct link between personal health and professional capacities like scientific theorizing. </li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation in the Medical System</strong> : Leo Gura discusses the lack of a holistic approach in the medical field, recounting experiences with specialists who are reluctant to treat symptoms not aligning with their specific criteria. This fragmentation can lead to misdiagnoses or untreated conditions, as doctors often fail to consider the interconnectedness of bodily systems. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Healthcare</strong> : The need for a holistic perspective in healthcare is emphasized through the example of interconnected health issues involving teeth, the immune system, and the gut. Many health problems, such as autoimmune disorders, could potentially be resolved if the medical community and treatments adopted a holistic approach. </li>
<li><strong>Nutrition and Health</strong> : Leo argues that dietary changes, such as adopting a plant-based whole foods diet and incorporating fasting, can cure health conditions like heart disease more effectively than medication. He criticizes the medical industry&rsquo;s unholistic approach, which often neglects nutrition and exercise in treatment plans. </li>
<li><strong>Nutritional Fads and Holism</strong> : The proliferation of fad diets reflects a lack of holistic thinking in nutrition. These diets often focus on specific goals like weight loss or ethical considerations without assessing overall long-term health impacts or broader issues like animal welfare and environmental sustainability. </li>
<li><strong>Diet Complexity and Ethics</strong> : Veganism, while ethically motivated, does not guarantee personal health if the diet consists of poor quality foods. Leo stresses the importance of considering health, societal implications, and environmental impacts when choosing a diet, advocating for a balanced and informed approach to nutrition. </li>
<li><strong>Simplistic Nutritional Labels</strong> : Leo criticizes the oversimplification of nutrition to just a few components on food labels. These labels fail to account for diverse nutrients, their varying impacts based on individual differences such as age and gender, and the ethical sourcing of ingredients. </li>
<li><strong>Business Practices Lacking Holism</strong> : Leo Gura critiques modern business practices for their focus on profit at the expense of valuable domains such as health, environment, social well-being, and spirituality. He suggests that businesses should genuinely care for these aspects rather than exploit them for monetary gain. </li>
<li><strong>Soulless nature of modern business</strong> : Businesses often disregard the importance of art, spirituality, and societal well-being, focusing only on profit. This approach strips business of its spirit and is detrimental to society. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org's business model</strong> : Leo prioritizes impact on elevating human consciousness over profit and marketing strategies. Despite potential financial gains, he focuses on content quality, which he views as beneficial in the long term. </li>
<li><strong>Corporate culture criticism</strong> : Disgusted by the lack of appreciation for art, spirituality, and health within corporate culture, Leo left the game development industry to pursue an independent approach that aligns with his values. </li>
<li><strong>Game development industry issues</strong> : Unhealthy practices like long working hours, poor nutrition, and a culture that resists change are prevalent in the game development industry, leading to potential health issues for employees. </li>
<li><strong>Toxic marketing practices</strong> : Modern marketing is criticized for negatively influencing societal well-being and human psychology by shaping desires, fears, and worldviews through constant exposure to advertisements. </li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical consequences of unholistic thinking</strong> : The Iraq War is portrayed as an example of the failure to holistically consider the complexities of a region, highlighting the dangers of unholistic decisions in geopolitics. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific ignorance of metaphysics and epistemology</strong> : Science is often conducted with disregard for metaphysical and epistemological foundations, limiting potential progress and deepening understanding, as demonstrated by issues like the unresolved mind-body problem. </li>
<li><strong>Separation of science and spirituality</strong> : The unholistic viewpoint held by some scientists keeps consciousness and spirituality dismissed as unscientific, preventing a unified view of matter and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of generalization in scientific discoveries</strong> : Scientists often fail to apply insights from areas like quantum mechanics to broader domains, which limits the holistic application of such discoveries. </li>
<li><strong>Reductionism in mathematics</strong> : The field of mathematics, as seen in responses to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, demonstrates a reluctance to apply its implications beyond narrowly defined systems, showing a lack of holistic thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to holistic generalizations</strong> : In fields like logic, mathematics, and science, there is a tendency to stay confined within established domains, ignoring the possibility of broader, interconnected implications and deeper understandings. </li>
<li><strong>Shortcomings of current psychology</strong> : Psychology, as it stands, lacks a holistic perspective by disregarding spirituality, nonduality, philosophy, metaphysics, and existential considerations. Consequently, therapists often struggle with effectively treating patients because many psychological issues stem from deeper spiritual and metaphysical problems. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of behavioral psychology</strong> : Skinner&rsquo;s behaviorism, which dismisses internal experiences such as moods and consciousness, is cited as an example of reductionistic thinking in psychology. Despite recognition of its limitations in modern times, similar reductionist approaches persist subtly across academia and science. </li>
<li><strong>Historical failures of reductionism</strong> : Leo outlines various historical attempts at reductionism within logic and mathematics like Logicism, spearheaded by thinkers like Bertrand Russell and Hilbert&rsquo;s project, which ultimately failed. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems and Russell's paradox challenged these reductionist frameworks, emphasizing the complexity and unity of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of holistic thought in science</strong> : Despite an understanding of reductionism's failings, a holistic viewpoint is often missing in modern scientific practice. Examples include the dismissal of psychedelics for scientific study due to a lack of holistic engagement. </li>
<li><strong>Technological ethics</strong> : In technology, ethics are often overlooked, and many technologies are developed for purely business purposes without considering their broader impacts. This lack of holistic thinking prioritizes profit over ethical considerations. </li>
<li><strong>Einstein's Theory of Relativity</strong> : Einstein&rsquo;s progression from special to general relativity is discussed as a move towards a more holistic understanding. However, Einstein could have expanded his thought further by applying the concept of relativity to all aspects of the universe, exemplifying a truly holistic perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Educational system's lack of holism</strong> : The current educational system is critiqued for neglecting important subjects like personal development, emotional intelligence, love, epistemology, metaphysics, spirituality, nutrition, and health, which stunts social development. Leo advocates for an education system that aligns with what he teaches at Actualized.org. </li>
<li><strong>Building a new education paradigm</strong> : Leo sees Actualized.org as the foundation of a new education system focused on the profound lessons vital for life. His teachings are a product of holistic research and thought, aiming to fill the gaps left by current educational structures due to systemic issues and red tape. </li>
<li><strong>Scope of Actualized.org's Impact</strong> : Despite not reaching as many people as the education system, Actualized.org aims to provide advanced, meaningful content to those deeply interested. Over time, current education may incorporate elements from this and similar advanced teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Holism in Education and Scientific Studies</strong> : Scientific studies lack holism and present narrow results that are context-dependent and potentially misleading. This unholistic approach is particularly evident in studies on nutrition, like the effects of coffee or red wine on health. </li>
<li><strong>Individual Problems Stemming from Lack of Holism</strong> : Hedonistic lifestyles, overindulgence in junk food, not exercising, staying in unrewarding jobs due to financial gains, and maintaining an unbalanced work-life, all exhibit a lack of holistic thinking, and ignoring long-term well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Misaligned Work and Lifestyle Choices</strong> : People often stay in high-paying, unsatisfactory jobs, or overwork at the expense of health and relationships. Holistic thinking would prioritize alignment with life values and purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Medical Check-ups and Project Goal Misalignment</strong> : Avoiding necessary medical visits and losing sight of original project goals can have detrimental effects, both avoidable through a more holistic approach. </li>
<li><strong>Being Economically Minded in Employment and Relationships</strong> : Hiring cheap labor and lying in relationships are unholistic practices that can lead to workplace issues and relationship breakdowns, emphasizing the need for quality and honesty. </li>
<li><strong>Unholistic Approach in Relational Dynamics and Pickup Culture</strong> : In relationships, focusing solely on one's needs or the pickup community's male-centric views misses the essence of meaningful connections, showcasing a blatant lack of holism. </li>
<li><strong>Staying Together for Children and Unethical Business Practices</strong> : Couples staying together for their children's sake without considering the toxicity of their relationship and businesses ripping off customers are examples of short-term views lacking in long-term holistic understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Theory versus Practice</strong> : Dismissing theoretical knowledge in favor of practicality limits progress and the potential to refine or completely rethink practices, highlighting the need for a balance between both. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Negligence</strong> : Ignoring the importance of spiritual work and existential contemplation can lead to a life filled with suffering, especially in the face of aging and death, representing the ultimate lack of holistic understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual work and its importance</strong> : Failing to engage in spiritual work throughout life can lead to profound suffering, particularly as one ages and faces death, which may result from a lack of realization about what death truly signifies, as well as an attachment to the ego. </li>
<li><strong>Duality between individual and collective levels</strong> : Holistic thinking should acknowledge that individual and collective levels are intimately intertwined and balanced with each other, like strands of DNA. Separating these levels leads to societal and personal fragmentation, disease, and evil. </li>
<li><strong>Problems caused by unholistic thinking</strong> : A large number of world issues and personal problems stem from an unholistic perspective. Paradigms that lack holism, such as materialistic self-help teachings, conventional medicine, and various philosophical and spiritual schools, can lead to suffering and brokenness. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of paradigm lock</strong> : A lack of holism results in what Leo calls "paradigm lock," where one becomes trapped within a particular worldview or paradigm, limiting their broader understanding and preventing the recognition of interconnected bubbles of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Breaking out of paradigms through holism</strong> : Holistic thinking enables one to rise above individual paradigms and integrate different perspectives to form a higher understanding, contributing to a process Leo refers to as "mind jailbreaking." </li>
<li><strong>Corruption as a manifestation of lack of holistic intelligence</strong> : Corruption, beyond government and corporate levels, is a deep-seated problem resulting from a lack of holistic intelligence and is pervasive throughout society. </li>
<li><strong>The catch-22 of holism</strong> : Appreciating the value of holistic thinking is essential to practice it, but seeing the value itself requires a holistic perspective, creating a challenging circular situation. </li>
<li><strong>Choosing the holistic path for fulfillment</strong> : Although the unholistic path of wealth and luxury appears attractive, it ultimately leads to dissatisfaction and harm, whereas the holistic path provides deeper meaning and fulfillment, despite being more challenging. </li>
<li><strong>Practical application of holistic thinking</strong> : Holistic thinking includes considerations such as the impact of one's actions on the whole and recognizing the ramifications of our roles within larger systems. </li>
<li><strong>Components of holistic thinking</strong> : True holistic thinking involves taking all levels of existence into account, taking responsibility for one's effects on the whole, being aware of systemic emergent properties, internalizing external factors, and being conscious of the interconnectedness of actions and their broader impacts. </li>
<li><strong>Conclusion on the benefits of holistic thinking</strong> : Holistic thinking, while demanding, aligns with finding deeper meaning and winning at life. It calls for understanding the interconnectedness of all aspects, including personal, societal, and ecological, and leads to making informed, responsible choices. </li>
<li><strong>Integration Through Technology</strong> : Leo indicates that the rise of global internet connectivity is analogous to creating a collective hive mind, expanding our collective consciousness as new forms of awareness emerge from our interconnectedness. </li>
<li><strong>Emergent Consciousness</strong> : He suggests that, similar to individual consciousness arising from the interplay of cells and organs, a new kind of collective consciousness may be evolving within humanity due to technological integration, which he finds fascinating. </li>
<li><strong>Backfiring Mechanisms in Holistic Thinking</strong> : Leo explains that holistic thinking must account for the non-linear and counter-intuitive nature of complex systems, which often produce unexpected outcomes or even the opposite of what was intended. </li>
<li><strong>Part-to-Whole Relationship in Holistic Thinking</strong> : He asserts that holistic thought values both individual parts and the whole, considering their integration as well as acknowledging dualities' inevitable reunion. </li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Horizon in Holistic Thinking</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of long-term thinking, emphasizing consideration for future generations and broader, long-term effects of actions, like those related to climate change. </li>
<li><strong>Context, Relevance, and Balance in Holistic Thinking</strong> : He underscores the necessity of evaluating the relevance, priority, and context of issues and achieving balance when making decisions, putting the greater good first and foremost. </li>
<li><strong>Caring About the Whole</strong> : Leo challenges viewers to genuinely care about the whole, not merely think holistically, questioning whether they can transcend their own survival needs for the greater good. </li>
<li><strong>Solving Personal Survival Challenges</strong> : He advises that to adopt a holistic outlook, one must establish sustainable solutions for survival needs, thus freeing mental and emotional resources to consider larger societal concerns. </li>
<li><strong>Degrees of Holism in Politics and Science</strong> : Leo describes different levels of holistic understanding within politics and science, with the highest level recognizing these fields as expressions of universal self-awareness and infinite love. </li>
<li><strong>Limits of Cognitive Development</strong> : He acknowledges that most people are unable to grasp the highest level of holistic understanding due to limited cognitive development and a focus on immediate survival and self-interest. </li>
<li><strong>Elevation of Consciousness in Politics</strong> : Politics, viewed from the highest holistic perspective, relates to the elevation of global consciousness and collective love, moving from divisive tribalism towards unity. </li>
<li><strong>Science as an Exploration of Consciousness</strong> : At the highest level, Leo posits that science seeks to understand the universe as a manifestation of consciousness and love, identical to the process of spirituality. </li>
<li><strong>Different Levels of Holism in Various Fields</strong> : Leo emphasizes that every activity, from filmmaking to making love, can be approached from different levels of holism, highlighting a spectrum of depth in any creative or personal endeavor. </li>
<li><strong>Development of Holistic Thinking</strong> : Leo provides methods to enhance holistic thinking, which include asking higher quality questions, using psychedelics for awakening and expanding consciousness, developing intuition, studying diverse perspectives, and eliminating judging and criticism. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Quality Questions and Continuous Learning</strong> : He underscores the power of insightful questions and continuous education in advancing holistic thinking, directing viewers to his episodes that delve into these topics. </li>
<li><strong>Holism and God Consciousness</strong> : Leo describes how awe and wonder, such as that experienced when observing nature or the stars, stem from a deep connection to the divine, implying that an appreciation for nature is an expression of self-love because we are, in essence, the universe experiencing itself. </li>
<li><strong>Powerful Questions to Encourage Holism</strong> : He presents questions designed to foster a holistic mindset by encouraging individuals to consider connections, the bigger picture, the ultimate purpose of actions, and how individual behaviors impact the whole, prompting self-reflection and a broader understanding of one&rsquo;s role in larger systems. </li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Reductionism within Holism</strong> : Leo warns against viewing holism and reductionism as dichotomies, suggesting that a truly holistic perspective should integrate reductionistic aspects too, recognizing their place within the whole. </li>
<li><strong>Ethical Misuse of Holistic Knowledge</strong> : Leo warns that utilizing holism to manipulate systems for personal gain is not genuine holism but rather exploitation, which he aligns with unethical behavior and corruption. </li>
<li><strong>Final Reflections on Holistic Living</strong> : Leo closes by asserting the importance of serving the greatest whole and aligning one&rsquo;s life with holistic principles, which he believes is the key to successfully navigating life. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge of absolute holism</strong> : Embracing true holism is extremely challenging as it requires accepting all aspects of reality, including evil and unholistic elements, threatening the ego and demanding significant surrender. </li>
<li><strong>Holism as a state of consciousness</strong> : Ultimate holism isn't about thinking but is rooted in pure, infinite consciousness. Thinking has its limits, and the highest form of holism involves transcending rational thought to change one's state of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and holistic consciousness</strong> : Psychedelics can be a powerful tool for radically altering one's state of consciousness and experiencing holism. While they're not the only way, the feeling of interconnectedness they can induce demonstrates their potential for fostering holistic thinking. </li>
<li><strong>The fragmented mind and healing the world</strong> : A fragmented mind leads to a fragmented world, and world healing is dependent on the unification of our minds. Taking responsibility for healing the world is a choice that depends on one's willingness to act holistically. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic and unholistic solutions</strong> : Life presents problems with both holistic and unholistic solutions, and it's critical not to be seduced by quick, unholistic fixes. True solutions often require a more complex, long-term, and integrated approach. </li>
<li><strong>Unholistic paradigms and problem-solving</strong> : Problems deemed impossible to solve are often due to an unholistic approach. By questioning how to be more holistic in one's thinking, new avenues for problem-solving open up, offering hope and optimism. </li>
<li><strong>Holism and personal development</strong> : The highest good is equivalent to the highest holism. Seeking the highest level of holistic thinking aligns with achieving the highest good in life, leading to victory in the 'game of life'. </li>
<li><strong>Self-education and holistic thinking</strong> : To deepen one's holistic understanding, engaging with various educational resources, like reading books from the suggested reading list, is vital. This self-education supports the journey towards holistic thinking and self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic thinking in summary</strong> : Holistic thinking extends beyond the intellect to a deep embrace of all facets of existence, demanding ongoing self-awareness and the release of biases against what one perceives as negative. Continuous learning elevates one's perspective, leading to more effective problem-solving and improved quality of life.</li>
