            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Ng9OqpMmIb0' target='_blank'>The Ultimate Structure Of Reality Explained</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Out beyond all difference, there is a field. I'll meet you there."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality's Deliberate Structure</strong> : Leo introduces the concept that reality is structured in a precise and deliberate manner, which he argues is neither random nor accidental. He asserts that reality's structure pursues an ultimate logic that can be fully understood through deep contemplation and consciousness expansion. </li>
<li><strong>Definition of Reality by Leo</strong> : He equates reality with terms such as infinity, God, love, and consciousness, emphasizing that at the deepest level, these are identical concepts. Reality is an infinite conscious field that is singular and encompasses all experiences, whether from living beings or inanimate objects. </li>
<li><strong>Singularity of Consciousness</strong> : Leo discusses the singularity of reality's field of consciousness, explaining that perceived boundaries within this field&mdash;like those seemingly separating objects&mdash;are illusory. Therefore, every imagined division within the field does not actually compartmentalize it but is part of the singular whole. </li>
<li><strong>Unlimited Nature of Consciousness</strong> : He elaborates on how understanding the oneness of consciousness leads to the realization that it is completely unlimited. Since no external entity can impose limits on consciousness, all perceived limitations are self-created. </li>
<li><strong>State of Infinite Consciousness ('god mode')</strong> : Leo describes reaching a state of infinite consciousness or "god mode," where one becomes unconditionally powerful and capable of creating or altering reality at will. This state can only be achieved by completely relinquishing selfish desires and attachments. </li>
<li><strong>Comparison of Reality to a Video Game</strong> : Drawing an analogy between reality and video games, Leo posits that pre-birth, individuals are in 'god mode,' designing their entire universe and life. Post-birth, this knowledge is forgotten, and people begin to live within the confines of the limits they have self-imposed. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of Limitations and Imposing Limits</strong> : He insists that reality, while seemingly bounded by rules like gravity or time, is actually not inherently limited by these rules. Instead, these are simply aspects of reality that have been imagined into being, and magic is feasible because reality is fundamentally unlimited. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Self-creation and Responsibilities</strong> : Leo proposes that every individual is not only a part of reality but encompasses it in its entirety. Consequently, individuals are responsible for creating all aspects of their lives, including both their joys and struggles. </li>
<li><strong>Love as the Nature of the Universe</strong> : Finally, Leo describes love as the full acceptance and embrace of oneself. Since the universe is infinite and singular, it is synonymous with love. Becoming aware of this oneness is akin to the realization of God or ultimate reality, leading to infinite consciousness and love. </li>
<li><strong>State of Pure Undifferentiated Potential</strong> : The concept of a pre-Big Bang reality is presented as pure, undifferentiated infinity, or Godhead, where nothing specific like atoms, molecules, animals, or celestial bodies exist. It is a formless, timeless, and spaceless state of pure potential. </li>
<li><strong>Model of Reality Structure</strong> : Leo describes reality's structure as centered on an infinite singularity (Godhead) surrounded by various levels of fragmented consciousness. This model is akin to our solar system with the Sun at the center and planets at varying distances, symbolizing degrees of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation and Wholeness of Consciousness</strong> : As consciousness moves away from the center singularity, it becomes more fragmented, less whole, and takes on different forms. This fragmentation ranges from nearly perfect wholes to pieces so broken they seem unrelated to the original form. </li>
<li><strong>Levels of Consciousness and Proximity to Center</strong> : Beings closer to the center singularity are more complete, selfless, and godlike. Consciousness increases as one nears the center, leading to greater power and ability to manifest one's will directly into reality. </li>
<li><strong>Manifestation Abilities Related to Consciousness</strong> : The ability to manifest desires into reality is correlated with one's proximity to the singularity. Humans have some manifesting ability but are limited by their form and distance from the center. </li>
<li><strong>Requirement for Godlike Being</strong> : To be in the pure state of God, a being must be completely selfless. Selflessness equates to the absence of a finite self, overcoming all fears, selfishness, and attachments to fully merge into the singularity. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Nature of Love</strong> : Leo explains that love is fundamentally a form of desire. Love can be narrow and selfish or universal and selfless. The journey towards the singularity entails expanding one's desire from personal attachments to a selfless desire for universal well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Trade-off Between Selflessness and Survival</strong> : An existential trade-off exists between personal survival needs and selflessness. As beings focus on survival, their ability to care for others diminishes. Conversely, the more selfless the desire, the closer a being moves toward the center of singularity and pure love. </li>
<li><strong>Becoming the Singularity Through Selflessness</strong> : Reaching the singularity involves becoming completely formless, losing all fears and attachments, and existing in a state of pure infinite potential. Achieving this state requires total surrender to pure love, goodness, and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Distance from the Singularity Defines Existence</strong> : Every living being's form and consciousness depend on their distance from the formless singularity. The further away, the more a being is engaged in survival and the less godlike it is, with more attachments and fears. </li>
<li><strong>Spectrum of Consciousness and Selflessness</strong> : All beings exist at varying distances from the singularity of consciousness. Proximity to the singularity correlates with being more conscious, selfless, loving, and complete. Beings close to the center are less about personal desires and more about universal betterment. </li>
<li><strong>Fear and Selfishness as Intertwined</strong> : Beings at a distance from the singularity are characterized by selfishness and fear, particularly fear of losing their self-identity or confronting death. As such, they exhibit attachment to their way of life and survival instincts. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Upbringing on Fear and Love</strong> : Individuals' tendencies towards fear or love may be influenced by their upbringing. Characteristics of selflessness or fear exhibited by parents often transfer to their children. </li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Structure of God and Love</strong> : God is the singularity as well as all the surrounding fragments. In its infinite consciousness, God loves and accepts all parts of itself, understanding that some beings are far from the center yet seeking reconnection. </li>
<li><strong>Gravitational Desire Towards Singularity</strong> : Time facilitates a gravitational pull that draws all fragments closer to the singularity. This is akin to stars orbiting and being drawn into a supermassive black hole in a spiral galaxy. </li>
<li><strong>Desires as Fragmented Consciousness Seeking Completion</strong> : Individual desires are finite because they come from finite pieces of consciousness. The grand design embeds these desires to progressively lead fragments toward the singularity&mdash;toward infinite, indiscriminate love. </li>
<li><strong>Free Will to Enter Singularity</strong> : Beings must choose of their own volition to move towards the singularity by becoming more conscious. The transformation from selfishness to selflessness means willingly losing part of one's current identity. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges Faced by a Criminal for Transformation</strong> : Criminal behaviors can stem from a lack of love and opportunity, shaped by negative environments. Transforming such individuals into selfless beings involves gradually instilling higher quality desires and moving towards selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>God's Love and Human Reluctance</strong> : Most people are not ready to fully embrace God's love because it is too selfless and indiscriminate. Reluctance to lose personal identity, fears, and attachment maintains individuals on the periphery of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Catch-22 of God's Sharing of Love</strong> : God's primary desire is to share love, but the completeness of God's love necessitates fragmentation to allow shared experiences. Individuals separated from the singularity have to undergo their own journey back to realizing oneness with God. </li>
<li><strong>Gravity as Metaphor for Conscious Unification</strong> : The motion of all matter, from stars to galaxies, is driven by desire for unification, metaphorically represented by gravity. This desire for greater unity is implanted in every being and object. </li>
<li><strong>Dual Forces of Attraction and Repulsion</strong> : While there's a natural inclination towards union, an opposite force of repulsion exists, driven by fear and reluctance to surrender self-identity and attachments. This tension affects every aspect of life and the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Fear as a repulsive force</strong> : Fear is the foundation of repulsion in relationships as it opposes love. Initially, attraction in relationships is strong, but as intimacy deepens, fear can cause individuals to seek distance in order to maintain their separate identities, preventing the complete merging with another or with God. </li>
<li><strong>Intimacy and identity</strong> : Close relationships, exemplified by sexual intimacy, bring individuals closer to merging with each other. However, fear of losing one's identity can cause people to withdraw after intimacy to reclaim their personal space and distinct self. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing unity and individuality</strong> : The dance between seeking connection (with people, money, sex, etc.) and fearing annihilation if too much closeness occurs. This balance determines one's position in the radial model of consciousness regarding fear, love, selfishness, and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Self-imposed limitations</strong> : As people become more aware, they begin questioning why their desires are limited&mdash;for example, why they prefer certain people or things over others. Such limitations are seen as acts of selfishness which, when released, can lead to higher consciousness and closer proximity to selflessness and the 'god state'. </li>
<li><strong>Desire for finite achievements</strong> : Exploring why finite success (e.g., money, sex, fame) never leads to true happiness, Leo discusses hedonic adaptation&mdash;the psychological theory that satisfaction diminishes with increased consumption. This pushes individuals to confront their fears and seek completeness, aligning with God. </li>
<li><strong>Love and surrender</strong> : God's love is so unconditional and indiscriminate that fully experiencing it could obliterate our finite existence. To surrender to this love, individuals must relinquish all attachments to life, including bodily and psychological needs, which stands in opposition to survival instincts. </li>
<li><strong>Death as infinite love</strong> : Misconstruing death as an end, rather than a transformation into what God essentially is&mdash;an omniscient, omnipotent, and loving consciousness. The more attachments one has, the more separate they are from God. </li>
<li><strong>Goodness as a conscious choice</strong> : Goodness must be recognized and chosen freely, not forced. Infinite goodness requires a total surrender of one's life and attachments, but individuals often fear this complete release. </li>
<li><strong>Transformative power of patient goodness</strong> : Real change in someone's behavior is best achieved through exhibiting one's own goodness, rather than judgment or coercion. Supporting them patiently and selflessly can set an example that inspires change, akin to caring for an abused child or a feral kitten. </li>
<li><strong>Feral Kitten and Consciousness</strong> : A feral kitten with no mother and love demonstrates a state of fear and survival. Through ongoing, gentle care and attention from a rescuer, the kitten becomes rehabilitated, reflecting how consciousness can be transformed from fear and selfishness into self-sufficiency and love. </li>
<li><strong>Human Consciousness Needing Love</strong> : Leo equates the kitten's transformation to the human experience, where God's love is trying to elevate fragmented human consciousness. This process involves overcoming resistance and fear, with God nurturing humans through subtle ways and gentle guidance. </li>
<li><strong>Distractions and True Mission</strong> : People commonly distract themselves from their true mission of becoming selfless and loving. They engage in numbing behaviors like watching TV or playing video games to avoid facing fears and attachments. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity for Conscious Selflessness</strong> : As individuals realize that a selfish lifestyle fails to bring true happiness, they become driven to a more selfless way of being. Love and goodness are the highest rewards, infinitely surpassing material gains. </li>
<li><strong>Experience of Infinite Love</strong> : Leo describes personal experiences of states of infinite love, noting that such states are akin to an infinite orgasm. He suggests that the Godhead experiences such love perpetually because it is fully in love with itself. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Surrender for True Love</strong> : To experience true, infinite love, one has to surrender all elements of individuality, including criticisms, judgments, and biological impulses, to become one with the universe and achieve the Godhead. </li>
<li><strong>Imagination and Fear as Barriers to God</strong> : The perception of not being God is a self-imposed illusion due to fear and imagination. Reality is structured by God to maximize the sharing of love. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Life's Purpose</strong> : Every individual is exactly where they need to be in life to ultimately discover infinite love, which Leo associates with seeking God consciously. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Realization as God</strong> : Becoming God requires individuals to awaken to their true nature through facing fears and becoming conscious of themselves as infinite beings. Genuine self-love is necessary for this realization. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility to Love</strong> : Knowing the truth about love and consciousness bestows responsibility on individuals to develop a spiritual path towards God. However, not everyone is willing to fully surrender to the singularity and become one with God. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Transformation and Recognition</strong> : Conscious recognition and willingness are essential for spiritual transformation and progress toward divine love. Consciously narrowing the orbit towards the divine center is the challenge individuals face in their spiritual journey. </li>
<li><strong>Transcending self to enter the singularity</strong> : Leo reiterates that personal transformation into God is necessary to enter the singularity. This transformation is achieved through a gradual increase in consciousness, awareness, and love. </li>
<li><strong>Practical advice on overcoming attachments</strong> : Rather than discipline and forced actions like reading, meditation, or attending seminars, Leo advises that growth comes through love. One should learn to give oneself the love that they have been denied by others. </li>
<li><strong>Creation of love's positive feedback loop</strong> : By filling oneself with love, individuals can reduce neediness, attract similarly loving people, and create a cycle of love that expands their capacity for selflessness and positivity. </li>
<li><strong>Individual and collective progression towards the center</strong> : Both on a personal and societal level, self-development involves moving towards the center of the singularity. Models like Spiral Dynamics describe this as a collective relinquishment of fear and attachment. </li>
<li><strong>Facing, understanding, and overcoming fear</strong> : To fundamentally grow in love, Leo suggests confronting fears, understanding them as illusions, and allowing love to replace fear, thereby leading to fewer attachments and a more fulfilling life. </li>
<li><strong>Self-responsibility for love generation</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for generating one's own love rather than relying on others to provide it, thus overcoming obstacles that block self-love. </li>
<li><strong>Vision of selfless life</strong> : Imagining a life devoid of selfishness across all aspects encourages individuals to consider what they must surrender to live with universal love and selflessness. </li>
<li><strong>Cause of suffering is attachment, not the world</strong> : Suffering is caused by insistence that things conform to one's desires for happiness. Letting go of such attachments is key to achieving true happiness and love. </li>
<li><strong>Role of the universe in selfless growth</strong> : The universe, as explained by Leo, is learning to love itself, ultimately becoming an expression of pure love. Individuals are encouraged to participate in this process for their own and the universe's growth. </li>
<li><strong>Self-realization as God for ultimate love</strong> : Realizing oneself as a fragment of divine consciousness is essential to participate in the highest form of love. Surrendering all that is finite and embracing one's infinite divine essence will lead to the ultimate reunification with love. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and actualizing life structure</strong> : Leo concludes that understanding the structure of life and self is not an illusion but an attainable reality. He suggests that humans can experience infinite self-understanding and wisdom, resulting in superhuman capabilities if they consciously unravel layers of their imagination.</li>
