        <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's Personal Demon</strong> : Leo expresses that his major internal struggle has always been balancing business needs and profitability with his pursuit of beauty and creativity, especially noted during his time in game design. </li>
<li><strong>Tension between Art and Commerce</strong> : He describes the conflict he faced between wanting to create beautiful, creative projects and the necessity to handle real-life business issues such as funding and marketing. Leo notes that often the business aspect overshadows the creative value, leading to a sacrifice of quality for profitability. </li>
<li><strong>Inversion in Creative Endeavors</strong> : He discusses a common problem in creative industries where business and financial concerns can become the focus, instead of supporting and enhancing the creative value of a project. </li>
<li><strong>Strategic Avoidance vs. Confrontation</strong> : While acknowledging strategic avoidance of problems as sometimes necessary, Leo warns against indefinite evasion, as it can ultimately cause dissatisfaction with life. He suggests viewers identify and confront their personal challenges as part of their growth. </li>
<li><strong>Demons in Various Aspects of Life</strong> : Leo generalizes the concept of internal demons to include a variety of personal issues one might face concerning health, relationships, money, family, etc. </li>
<li><strong>The Hero's Journey and Threshold Guardians</strong> : He refers to Joseph Campbell's "hero's journey," comparing personal struggles to threshold guardians&mdash;significant obstacles that one must overcome to achieve their goals. </li>
<li><strong>Recurring problems despite career changes</strong> : Leo observes that avoiding demons may provide temporary relief, but those issues tend to resurface, indicating the importance of addressing the root causes. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Mental Shifts</strong> : He emphasizes that overcoming these obstacles often requires transformative mental shifts and ego bruises but cautions against procrastination that could lead to wasted years. </li>
<li><strong>Weighing Long-Term Pain against Immediate Action</strong> : Leo urges viewers to consider the cumulative future pain of unresolved issues against the immediate discomfort of confronting these problems, advocating for proactive solutions now. </li>
<li><strong>Focus on One Problem at a Time</strong> : He advises dealing with one major issue before moving on to the next, understanding that resolving one often leads to the emergence of another, but emphasizing the importance of sequential focus. </li>
<li><strong>Call to Action and Personal Development</strong> : Leo closes by asking viewers to reflect on their own demons, share his content, and follow his work at Actualized.org, tying his personal experiences into a message of inspiration for tackling big life challenges.</li>
