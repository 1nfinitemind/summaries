            <ul>
<li><strong>Morning refreshment and revelation</strong> : Woke up feeling refreshed with a sense of deep, meaningful dreams indicating spiritual purification commonly experienced during retreats.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to disciplined practice</strong> : Faced ongoing resistance throughout the morning with a lack of motivation for self-inquiry, feeling a sense of rustiness and questioning the effort invested when past retreats have sometimes yielded no tangible results.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast between psychedelic experience and manual effort</strong> : Reflects on the ease of achieving enlightenment states with psychedelics compared to the manual effort required in non-psychedelic retreats, noting a conflicting sense of motivation and demotivation.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental challenges and internal struggles</strong> : Encountered interruptions from frequent helicopter tour noises and the lure of Hawaii's attractions, which fueled the desire to abandon the process and surrender to distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic nature of retreats</strong> : Notes the unpredictable ebb and flow of emotional and mental states during retreats, with the potential for rapid shifts and the importance of avoiding escape and staying committed to the process.</li>
<li><strong>Time pressures on shorter retreats</strong> : Expresses feeling rushed due to the shorter seven-day retreat format, recognizing the preference for a 10-day retreat to alleviate the rush and fully engage in the process without distraction.</li>
<li><strong>Shift into surrender and nature's embrace</strong> : As external interruptions waned and rain set in, found tranquility in nature, which facilitated deeper focus, concentration, and mindfulness, cultivating a more effective meditation practice towards evening.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusting to a less structured approach</strong> : Stopped meticulously tracking meditation sessions, adopting a more intuitive approach to maintaining mindfulness, indicating a shift from structured tracking to a holistic, continuous practice.</li>
<li><strong>Deepening self-inquiry</strong> : Leo had an insightful moment of self-inquiry, looking at his hands and reflecting on the absence of a 'self' behind perception, bringing forward experiences from psychedelic sessions to his sober state, and feeling the closeness of a 'no-self' realization.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating mindfulness opportunistically</strong> : Instead of a strict meditation schedule, Leo embraced spontaneous moments of insight, such as the kitchen episode, showing an intuitive approach and willingness to dive into self-inquiry whenever opportunities arise, using methods like hand observation to stay grounded.</li>
<li><strong>Preparation for continued effort</strong> : Acknowledging the possibility of fluctuating moods and the return of distractions like helicopters, Leo prepared himself for the challenges ahead, especially entering day three, typically when the retreat deepens.</li>
<li><strong>The harsh reality of retreats</strong> : Leo dismantled the misconception that meditation retreats are akin to relaxing vacations, highlighting the gritty reality of confronting addictions, loneliness, and various annoyances, requiring significant discipline and effort.</li>
<li><strong>A call for universal spiritual work</strong> : Emphasizing the importance of spiritual work for mastering life and finding true happiness, Leo pointed out that both the rich and the poor often neglect this essential practice due to distractions, responsibilities, or lack of awareness, advocating for everyone to engage in this transformative work regardless of their social status.</li>
