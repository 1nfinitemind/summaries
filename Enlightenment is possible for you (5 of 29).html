            <ul>
    <li><b>Abstract belief versus personal realization</b>: Many individuals contemplate the work but fail to believe in the personal possibility of achieving it, distinguishing between believing that something can be done generally versus the realization that they themselves can actually make it happen.
</li><li><b>Creating self–centric possibilities</b>: To facilitate personal growth, one must nurture the belief that they are capable of accomplishment because anything that is possible in theory is also possible for them, given that nobody else can fulfill their individual potential.
</li><li><b>Existential proximity to potential</b>: Leo highlights the notion that our potential and possibilities are not distant; they are inherently connected to our existence, emphasizing that the truth about our capabilities is not elsewhere but present in our current reality.
</li><li><b>Simplicity in action</b>: Emphasizing the ease of taking control, Leo suggests that the pathway to grasping personal truth and potential is straightforward and attainable right where one currently stands–it's a matter of just taking action.
