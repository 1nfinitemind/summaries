        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/v_poNe3gDEM' target='_blank'>Redefining Philosophy - How To Become A Jedi Master</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Redefining philosophy</strong> : Leo describes current philosophy courses in universities as a distortion, focusing on academic trivialities instead of its original intent, which is to guide how we live a fulfilling life. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy's literal meaning</strong> : The word "philosophy" comes from Greek for "love of wisdom," which historically encompassed seeking knowledge to understand life and psychology, not just academic knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophers living their truths</strong> : Unlike today's theoretical approach, ancient philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle practiced and embodied the wisdom they taught, aiming to lead virtuous lives. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as self-actualization</strong> : Leo sees philosophy as aligned with Abraham Maslow's concept of self-actualization&mdash;living to one's fullest potential by pursuing virtues like honesty, duty, friendship, and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy's hijacking</strong> : Leo condemns the transformation of philosophy into a hollow academic practice, stripped of its essence to live better lives, which he finds disgraceful and calls for a return to its origins. </li>
<li><strong>Positive psychology's alignment with philosophy</strong> : Leo points out the recent development of positive psychology that focuses on creating a happy, fulfilling life&mdash;what original philosophy aimed to do. </li>
<li><strong>Personal engagement with philosophy</strong> : Advocating that everyone should be a philosopher, Leo encourages critical thinking and lifelong learning to question our existence and develop practical wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy and Star Wars analogy</strong> : He employs Star Wars to illustrate the concept of philosophy, comparing Jedi masters to philosophers seeking higher ideals, while equating others to ordinary characters or the dark side, encouraging viewers to strive to be Jedi-like in their pursuit of virtue. </li>
<li><strong>Practical nature of philosophy</strong> : Leo stresses that philosophy's true purpose is not abstract thought but practical wisdom that enhances our lives and leads us to question the values and standards of society. </li>
<li><strong>Taking back philosophy</strong> : He invites viewers to join him in reclaiming philosophy from academia and to actively expand their understanding of themselves and the world through reflection and critical analysis. </li>
<li><strong>Jabba the Hutt as a lifestyle</strong> : Jabba represents a large portion of evil in life which stems from unconsciousness and complacency rather than active malice. By embodying Jabba, one lives without awareness or the pursuit of higher values. </li>
<li><strong>The Jedi represents consciousness</strong> : Leo highlights the Jedi as conscious beings who possess wisdom and understanding of psychology, capable of self-control, and driven by a cause that serves consciousness rather than selfish complacency. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and mastering psychology as the "Force"</strong> : The Force is equated with self-mastery and psychological understanding, enabling control over one's emotions and actions, ultimately leading to a purposeful and powerful existence. </li>
<li><strong>Assessing self-mastery</strong> : One's degree of self-mastery, including discipline and emotional intelligence, is a benchmark for their Jedi-like status. Without these skills, individuals struggle with self-control and are likened to inexperienced Jedi. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge of Jedi training</strong> : Leo acknowledges the inherent difficulty in pursuing the path of enlightened wisdom and self-mastery, just as not everyone in the Star Wars universe can become a Jedi due to the rigorous training involved. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing the value of philosophy and self-mastery</strong> : Many dismiss the pursuit of philosophy and self-knowledge as abstract or unrealistic, overlooking the long-term benefits and the profound difference it can make in one&rsquo;s life. </li>
<li><strong>The potential within self-mastery</strong> : Leo stresses the immense power and limitless potential that come from understanding and mastering one's own psychology, drawing parallels to the abilities of a Jedi. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom and the difficulty of transmitting it</strong> : Leo reflects on the challenge of communicating the deep value of wisdom to those who are comfortable with their current lives and skeptical of significant change. </li>
<li><strong>Jabba's resistance to transformation</strong> : People living comfortably in their routines, much like Jabba the Hutt, are often too set in their ways, resistant to embarking on the difficult path of self-mastery and Jedi-like enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Psychological limitations as illusions</strong> : Leo argues that many of the perceived barriers in our lives are psychological, and once understood and mastered, they reveal the true extent of one's capabilities, much like manipulating the Matrix. </li>
<li><strong>Urging to embrace the path of wisdom</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to engage with the path towards self-improvement, wisdom, and self-mastery, highlighting the profound and fulfilling experiences that lie ahead. </li>
<li><strong>Invitation to join Leo's community</strong> : He invites viewers to connect with his resources at Actualized.org, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and application, and offers bonuses to those who subscribe to his newsletter.</li>
