            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/i4EwtuSuF1E' target='_blank'>How To Study - The Keys To Acing School & College</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Personal Experience with Studying</b>: Leo shares his transformation from a below–average student to a top performer in high school and college, highlighting that effective studying is a developed skill, not an innate talent.
</li><li><b>Studying as an Acquired Skill</b>: Leo emphasizes that studying is a skill you develop through practice, hard work, and repetition, advocating for a growth mindset over a fixed mindset.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Limiting Beliefs</b>: Leo advises against letting educational institutions' labels define your abilities, stressing that limitations in learning are often misplaced and bureaucratic.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation</b>: Leo contrasts the damaging extrinsic motivation driven by societal pressures with the more effective intrinsic motivation that comes from a genuine desire to learn and grow.
</li><li><b>Studying for Life Mastery</b>: Leo points out that the true value of studying goes beyond grades to impact happiness, wealth, emotional stability, relationships, business, and understanding of the universe.
</li><li><b>Depth and Fascination in Every Subject</b>: Leo encourages finding depth and interest in even the most trivial subjects, urging an open–minded approach that acknowledges every aspect of life as worthy of study.
</li><li><b>Identifying Personal Interests</b>: Leo suggests that students take a moment to write a list of 20 areas in life they are deeply fascinated by as a step towards focusing their energy on studying what truly interests them.
</li><li><b>Learning Equals Repetition</b>: Learning doesn't require extraordinary intelligence; it's mostly about brute force repetition. By continually repeating information, the brain will learn and memorize, forming deeper interconnections and understanding.
</li><li><b>Discovering the Power of Repetition</b>: Leo's personal academic success in high school and college can be attributed to discovering that anything can be programmed into the mind through consistent study and repetition.
</li><li><b>Study Procedure & Environment</b>: Effective studying requires a dedicated and distraction–free environment. Leo used his bedroom, ensuring he could study without interruptions and had total control over his study space.
</li><li><b>Scheduled Study Times</b>: Setting a specific time for daily studying is essential. Leo's routine involved starting at 6 pm and adjusting the duration based on the workload, with weekends mostly off.
</li><li><b>Comfort, Patience, and Slow Studying</b>: To study effectively, one must slow down and be comfortable, understanding that mastering materials takes time and patience.
</li><li><b>Curiosity and Understanding Over Memorization</b>: Genuine curiosity in the subject matter should drive one's studying, focusing on understanding rather than memorizing facts for exams.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Understanding and Accuracy</b>: True studying aims at deeply understanding concepts and seeking accuracy, not just memorizing or knowing shortcuts to get the right answers.
</li><li><b>Taking and Keeping Notes</b>: Good note–taking is vital during classes or while reading, and maintaining an organized repository of notes is crucial for the learning process.
</li><li><b>Self–Testing and Repetition</b>: Active recall and testing oneself using questions from the material studied are key techniques for successful learning and memorization.
</li><li><b>Effective Recall for Memorization</b>: For information to be genuinely learned and memorized, it must be actively recalled correctly, supporting long–term retention and success in studies.
</li><li><b>Effective Recall Strategy</b>: To memorize effectively, Leo suggests repeatedly asking yourself to recall information until it becomes quick and effortless. If you can't remember the details, review the information and test recall until it sticks.
</li><li><b>Building Academic Momentum</b>: Leo emphasizes that becoming a great student takes time and consistent effort. He shares his personal experience of building positive study habits over months and years, stating it becomes easier once these habits are integrated.
</li><li><b>Studying's Purpose Beyond Grades</b>: Studying aims to develop a deeper understanding of reality and to build discipline and life skills. It's not limited to academic success but extends to creating a foundation for a fulfilling and designed life.
</li><li><b>Value of Rest and Proper Sleep</b>: Leo advises against all–nighters and cramming. He underlines the importance of scheduling sufficient rest and sleep, which are essential for effective learning and cognitive function.
</li><li><b>Joy and Long–Term Satisfaction of Studying</b>: Learning about how life works provides a different type of fulfillment compared to short–term activities like video games. Leo wants students to cultivate a love for learning due to its long–term rewards.
</li><li><b>Avoiding the Pain of Avoiding Study</b>: Leo points out that the discomfort of avoiding study can be worse than studying itself. He recommends setting up a comfortable environment to make studying an enjoyable process.
</li><li><b>Transitioning from Extrinsic to Intrinsic Motivation</b>: To become an effective student, it's important to find personal reasons for studying, rather than focusing on external pressures. This shift helps create a more enjoyable and less stressful study experience.
</li><li><b>Integrating Study Skills into Adult Life</b>: Leo concludes by stating the skills and discipline gained from studying are transferable to adult life. He encourages signing up for his newsletter for continued growth and self–knowledge beyond academic subjects.
