<p><em>"The intelligent want self-control; children want candy" - Rumi</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leo's Reflection on Rumi's Quote</strong> : Leo finds Rumi's quote profound and inspirational. He explains that the root problem of humanity is acting childishly by chasing after quick, temporary pleasures ('candy') instead of pursuing self-control, which is more important and fulfilling. </li>
<li><strong>Rumi's Identity and Work</strong> : Leo describes Rumi as a philosopher, poet, and mystic from the Middle Ages whose work encapsulates deep spiritual and enlightening concepts, and recommends his literature for those interested in profound psychological truths. </li>
<li><strong>The Pursuit of Excitement and Stimulation</strong> : According to Leo, people desire stimulation and excitement in various forms, from destructive behaviors like drug use to seemingly positive actions such as working hard at a job, though all are essentially forms of seeking 'candy.' </li>
<li><strong>Heroin to Career</strong> : Spectrum of Stimulation: He paints a spectrum that ranges from severe addiction (heroin) to socially acceptable goals (career, marriage), which, while more respectable, are still based on chasing external forms of happiness. </li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of External Success</strong> : Leo argues that socially accepted goals, such as working hard for a successful career or a good marriage, may still ultimately be equivalent to the pursuit of happiness through a substance like heroin, as they do not provide true fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Control versus External Pursuits</strong> : The truly wise, in Leo's view, strive for self-control and self-mastery, understanding that no external achievements can provide lasting happiness if one does not have control over their inner world. </li>
<li><strong>The Zen Master Archetype</strong> : Leo's ideal state of being is exemplified by the image of an old Zen master: tranquil, serene, accepting, and not driven by external desires. This state is achieved through practices that foster self-mastery and focus on internal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Approach to True Happiness</strong> : For lasting fulfillment and happiness, Leo advises turning inward and prioritizing self-control over the pursuit of fleeting pleasures, which are akin to candy. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org's Mission</strong> : Leo promotes Actualized.org as a platform to aid in self-actualization. It provides resources that emphasize self-development, inner peace, confidence, and present-moment happiness, all aligned with the pursuit of self-mastery.</li>
