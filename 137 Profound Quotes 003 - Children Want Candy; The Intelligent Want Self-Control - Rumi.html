            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Reflection on Rumi's Quote</b>: Leo finds Rumi's quote profound and inspirational. He explains that the root problem of humanity is acting childishly by chasing after quick, temporary pleasures ('candy') instead of pursuing self–control, which is more important and fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Rumi's Identity and Work</b>: Leo describes Rumi as a philosopher, poet, and mystic from the Middle Ages whose work encapsulates deep spiritual and enlightening concepts, and recommends his literature for those interested in profound psychological truths.
</li><li><b>The Pursuit of Excitement and Stimulation</b>: According to Leo, people desire stimulation and excitement in various forms, from destructive behaviors like drug use to seemingly positive actions such as working hard at a job, though all are essentially forms of seeking 'candy.'
</li><li><b>Heroin to Career: Spectrum of Stimulation</b>: He paints a spectrum that ranges from severe addiction (heroin) to socially acceptable goals (career, marriage), which, while more respectable, are still based on chasing external forms of happiness.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of External Success</b>: Leo argues that socially accepted goals, such as working hard for a successful career or a good marriage, may still ultimately be equivalent to the pursuit of happiness through a substance like heroin, as they do not provide true fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Self–Control versus External Pursuits</b>: The truly wise, in Leo's view, strive for self–control and self–mastery, understanding that no external achievements can provide lasting happiness if one does not have control over their inner world.
</li><li><b>The Zen Master Archetype</b>: Leo's ideal state of being is exemplified by the image of an old Zen master: tranquil, serene, accepting, and not driven by external desires. This state is achieved through practices that foster self–mastery and focus on internal growth.
</li><li><b>Approach to True Happiness</b>: For lasting fulfillment and happiness, Leo advises turning inward and prioritizing self–control over the pursuit of fleeting pleasures, which are akin to candy.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org's Mission</b>: Leo promotes Actualized.org as a platform to aid in self–actualization. It provides resources that emphasize self–development, inner peace, confidence, and present–moment happiness, all aligned with the pursuit of self–mastery.
