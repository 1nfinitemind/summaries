            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PineU9ZZvSc' target='_blank'>How To Contemplate Using A Journal</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Emphasizing Direct Experience for Truth Seeking</b>: Leo stresses the paramount importance of seeking existential and psychological truths through direct experience rather than relying on external sources like books, videos, ideologies, or even his own teachings. He warns against the dangers of falling into ideology, which can lead to delusions and significantly limit personal growth.
</li><li><b>Journal Contemplation Technique</b>: Leo introduces a technique for deep contemplation using a journal, where one writes down a question to focus on and actively thinks about it for a dedicated period without referencing external information. This process involves grounding oneself in direct examples from personal experience.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Mental Laziness</b>: Leo highlights that the success of contemplation depends on overcoming mental laziness. Similar to practicing math to truly understand it, one must engage in the effortful activity of deriving answers independently instead of taking shortcuts or copying from others–key distinctions between those who just consume information and those who genuinely seek truth.
</li><li><b>Concrete Examples in Contemplation</b>: Leo advises using concrete examples, such as the thought of a red apple, to ground contemplation. He emphasizes the distinction between simply thinking about thoughts, which can lead to speculation, and directly observing thoughts to learn what they actually are.
</li><li><b>Essence of Science</b>: Leo describes true scientific observation as akin to the process of contemplation. It involves observing an object or phenomenon as it is, without biases or projections, to understand its true nature.
</li><li><b>Contemplation on the Nature of Thoughts</b>: Leo explores comparing and contrasting different thoughts, such as visualizing a red apple versus a yellow lemon, and contemplating whether different instances of the same thought (e.g., thinking of a red apple multiple times) are unique or fundamentally the same. He emphasizes observing these in direct experience without preconceived notions.
</li><li><b>Differentiating Thoughts and Objects</b>: He examines if there's a distinction between physical objects and thoughts, questioning if a thought can be considered an object or has its own separate existence. He refrains from speculation, focusing on concrete examples and direct experience to discern the difference.
</li><li><b>Pure Observation of Thoughts</b>: Leo instructs to observe where thoughts come from without speculation, noting that since thoughts are constantly experienced, one should look within rather than consult external sources which cannot replace direct, personal access.
</li><li><b>Challenging Assumptions About Thoughts</b>: He challenges preconceptions, such as thoughts being exclusive to humans or located in the brain, suggesting they may stem from cultural or educational influences rather than direct experience.
</li><li><b>Contemplating the Fundamentals of 'Object'</b>: Leo contemplates what an object truly is, seeking a common denominator among all objects without resorting to speculation. He uses a pencil as a concrete example and questions the subjectivity of objects, inspecting the criteria for separateness and considering tangible versus intangible objects.
</li><li><b>Contemplation as an Expansive Process</b>: He details how a single contemplation question, such as "What is an object?", can blossom into numerous related questions. He advocates maintaining focus on the original question while exploring these offshoots to deepen understanding over time, without rushing for a simplified answer.
</li><li><b>Depth of the Contemplation Practice</b>: Leo explains that contemplation isn't about arriving at a single correct answer but about the process of thoroughly examining a concept. It's about expanding the mind's capacity to engage with complex questions and ideas, which in itself is valuable growth and maturation.
</li><li><b>Contemplating 'Evil'</b>: Using "What is evil?" as a contemplation example, he advises against mindless note–taking. Instead, he recommends reflecting deeply on examples from personal experience, questioning the objectivity or subjectivity of evil, and determining its existential basis beyond societal or cultural definitions.
</li><li><b>Nature of Evil</b>: Leo explores the nature of evil, considering whether it exists as a social construct, a natural law, or something with universal characteristics. He encourages questioning the validity of one's own answers and acknowledging cultural influences that shape our understanding of evil concepts.
</li><li><b>Cultural Perspectives on Evil</b>: Leo prompts considering the variable nature of evil; recognizing that what one culture may deem evil, another may not. He uses examples like bribery and murder in differing contexts such as self–defense or war, showing that the evaluation of evil is not consistent across cultures and situations.
</li><li><b>Exploring the Notion of Evil</b>: He leads a deep exploration into the notion of evil, questioning its purpose, the existence of degrees of evil, and the criteria for judging it. He raises the possibility of different standards for evil in humans compared to animals or hypothetical extraterrestrial beings, and ponders the utility of the concept itself.
</li><li><b>Contemplation of Murder</b>: Leo dissects the concept of murder to distinguish situations where it is and isn't considered evil, highlighting the complexity of moral judgments and their reliance on context, such as self–defense, war, euthanasia, or putting animals to sleep.
</li><li><b>Examining Personal Assumptions</b>: Addressing the dangers of uncritical acceptance, Leo advises writing down even seemingly nonsensical answers during contemplation, as doing so can reveal flawed logic and provoke deeper realizations when cross–referenced with direct experience.
</li><li><b>Meaning of Personal Development</b>: Leo challenges the listener to contemplate the essence of personal growth by comparing examples of undeveloped and developed individuals. He invites viewers to define personal development independently, beyond what has been learned from others.
</li><li><b>Developed vs. Undeveloped Characteristics</b>: By examining characteristics of people perceived as developed or undeveloped, Leo illustrates how personal development may manifest and what tangible changes might be necessary to grow by a quantifiable margin.
</li><li><b>Components of Personal Development</b>: The inquiry continues with contemplation on the components of personal development, questioning if it is only about becoming more loving or involves other aspects like education or the necessity of reading books, and whether one can develop without expanding knowledge or acting compassionately.
</li><li><b>Starting Assumptions for Contemplation</b>: Leo presents guiding assumptions for beginning contemplation: being full of assumptions, mistrusting the mind's pronouncements, taking all beliefs as false, considering direct experience as the only truth, and the robustness of truth that endures questioning.
</li><li><b>Contemplation Misconceptions</b>: Leo clarifies what contemplation is not: speculation, reinforcing existing beliefs, constructing new beliefs, daydreaming, devising arguments, justifying opinions, or achieving practical success. He defines it as breaking down ideas, being aware, and pursuing a pure understanding.
</li><li><b>Intimate Nature of Contemplation</b>: Contemplation is an intimate process that involves questioning assumptions, beliefs, teachings, and culture. It is deeply personal and involves thinking independently to uncover the truth, even if it's uncomfortable or scary.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Superficial Contemplation</b>: When contemplating questions related to the self, such as "What is happiness?", one must acknowledge personal biases and desires, recognizing that this pursuit of truth involves confronting ugly truths about oneself.
</li><li><b>Practical Questions for Contemplation</b>: Leo provides a list of questions for the viewer to start contemplating on various topics such as meaning, science, evil, ego, concepts, beliefs, truth, and value, emphasizing that these inquiries can fundamentally transform one's life.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Contemplation and Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo distinguishes contemplation from self–inquiry, explaining that the former involves using the mind to explore facets of life and is beneficial for personal development, while the latter, which involves transcending the mind, is reserved for more profound spiritual inquiry.
</li><li><b>Strategies for Effective Contemplation</b>: Successful contemplation requires open–mindedness, fearlessness, honesty, observation, impartiality, self–reliance, and genuine curiosity. It's a solitary journey of intense self–discovery where one must rely on their own faculties and sever ties with external influences.
</li><li><b>Contemplation Traps</b>: Leo warns of common traps in contemplation, such as holding ideas as self–evident, seeking preconceived "right" answers, and relying excessively on external sources. To overcome these, one should explore other cultures, travel, and maintain an awareness of the influence of one's cultural background.
</li><li><b>Isolated Dedication to Contemplation</b>: During contemplation, it is crucial to isolate oneself and refrain from referring to external sources, like books or videos. This ensures that the contemplation is unbiased and leads to unique insights.
</li><li><b>Impact of Personal Psychological Questions</b>: Contemplating personal psychological questions can lead to understanding how one might be lying to oneself or avoiding difficult truths, which is essential for personal growth and transformation.
</li><li><b>Isolation in Contemplation</b>: Contemplation requires isolating oneself from prior knowledge and information. Despite the challenge, it is necessary to learn how to set aside all that has been gathered from books, videos, and teachers to contemplate with a pure focus. 
</li><li><b>The Trap of Theory Building</b>: Constructing grand theories from contemplation is a dangerous trap. While understanding concepts like thoughts, emotions, or God is part of the process, creating structured, all–encompassing theories from these understandings can lead to confusion and a detachment from reality.
</li><li><b>False Skepticism</b>: Leo highlights the danger of 'false skepticism,' which is being skeptical of all except one's own beliefs and ideologies. True skepticism involves questioning foundational beliefs, ideologies, and even one's use of skepticism.
</li><li><b>Science and Rationalism Traps</b>: The trap associated with science and rationalism lies in accepting their theories and ideas without question. Leo advises against incorporating scientific rationalizations and justifications into contemplation to avoid biased results.
</li><li><b>Distraction During Contemplation</b>: Distractions are common traps that can derail contemplation. Leo emphasizes the importance of resisting the urge to engage in distractions and instead, focus on completing the contemplative session.
</li><li><b>Contemplation Discomfort</b>: Feeling scared and uneasy during contemplation is normal and signifies that one is challenging oneself. This discomfort is essential for developing intellectual independence and autonomy.
</li><li><b>Laziness and Education</b>: The mind's inherent laziness often leads to avoiding contemplation in favor of passive activities like watching videos. Leo underscores the importance of actually practicing personal development techniques to achieve growth.
</li><li><b>Implementation Over Theory</b>: Leo compares personal development to athletics, stressing the necessity of practice over theoretical knowledge. He warns against the illusion of growth that comes from absorbing content without applying the techniques discussed.
</li><li><b>Homework Assignment</b>: To facilitate practical application, Leo assigns a homework task: contemplate the question "What is meaning?" He encourages journaling on this topic for a week or a month to gain profound insights.
</li><li><b>Importance of Practice in Personal Development</b>: Leo reiterates the crucial role of actively engaging in practices for personal growth. He stresses that watching videos is insufficient and that one must apply the techniques to see real change in one's life.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Ideology</b>: There's a risk of turning Actualized.org or any educational content into an ideology if one does not practice the techniques discussed. Engaging in the practices is key to avoiding this trap and experiencing profound personal shifts.
</li><li><b>Growth Alongside Content</b>: Leo encourages viewers to grow alongside the content by practicing the techniques, thus enabling a deeper understanding of the profound concepts he intends to teach. For new viewers, a foundation of theory is important, but practice should follow soon after to ensure genuine progress.
