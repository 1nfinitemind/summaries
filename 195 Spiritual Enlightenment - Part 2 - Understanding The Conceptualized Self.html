            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/IX-oeoOqaYU' target='_blank'>Spiritual Enlightenment - Part 2 - Understanding The Conceptualized Self</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the Truth of No Self</b>: Leo continues discussing the concept of no self, emphasizing the illusionary nature of self–existence and the possibility of living beyond this illusion through empirical investigation.
</li><li><b>Empirical Investigation</b>: He advocates for an empirical approach to identifying 'Who am I?', 'What is the truth?', and 'What is reality or existence?'–dismissing theoretical speculation in favor of direct personal experience.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Obviousness of Self</b>: Leo challenges the assumption that one's identity is obvious and self–evident, proposing that it's actually a smokescreen cloaking a more profound truth.
</li><li><b>Deconstructing Physical Identity</b>: Through an investigative thought process, Leo demonstrates that physical parts like hands or organs are not central to our identity, pointing towards the mental or 'mind' as the seat of self.
</li><li><b>Mind and Conscious Experience</b>: He delves into the nature of the mind, questioning whether we are our thoughts or an entity that perceives or creates thoughts, and whether this entity is the soul or the spirit.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Definitions</b>: Leo warns against accepting societal beliefs about concepts like the soul and spirit without direct personal experience, encouraging viewers to look within themselves for answers.
</li><li><b>Reality and Existence</b>: Leo deconstructs the scientific model of reality beginning with the Big Bang, pointing out that it fails to address what predated it and questioning the assumption that something must come from something, leaving room for existence originating from nothing.
</li><li><b>The Problem of Conceiving Existence</b>: He illustrates the difficulty of conceiving existence from within a single instance of it (our own), comparing it to the limits of understanding based on a 'bubble' analogy and challenging the idea of an infinite regress of existence.
</li><li><b>The "God" Explanation of Existence</b>: Leo questions the validity of attributing the origin of existence to a deity. He highlights that the idea of God being the ever–present 'outer bubble' does not clarify the true nature of existence and merely pushes the question of origins further back.
</li><li><b>Kant's Phenomena vs. Noumena</b>: He introduces Kant's distinction between phenomena, which are direct sensory experiences, and noumena, the unknowable reality behind these sensations. Leo asserts that we can never truly access noumena due to the perceptual filter of our senses.
</li><li><b>Matter–Qualia Distinction</b>: Leo presents the scientific view distinguishing matter, the physical substance of objects, from qualia, our subjective experiences. He raises the philosophical question of the nature of qualia and their relationship to matter.
</li><li><b>Inner–Outer World Distinction</b>: He questions the conventional distinction between the inner world of feelings and thoughts and the outer world of physical matter and energy, challenging viewers to contemplate which is more foundational.
</li><li><b>Conceptualizations and Reality</b>: Leo discusses three levels of understanding–an object's true nature, the direct sensations it gives, and the concepts or thoughts we have about it. He suggests that humans mainly live in the realm of concepts, imposing them onto raw sensations.
</li><li><b>Identity as a Conceptual Construct</b>: Leo explains that what we conceive as 'self' is not a direct perception but a concept layered on perceptions, backed by further concepts convincing us of its reality.
</li><li><b>The Voice in Our Head</b>: He describes the internal voice that constantly generates thoughts, opinions, and a self–image, positing that this voice creates the concepts that we mistake for reality.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Physical Reality of the Self</b>: Leo invites speculation on whether our identification with the body is a factual reality or a conceptual construction, merely a result of the voice's narrative.
</li><li><b>Understanding Beyond Self–Image</b>: He challenges us to consider the real self that remains when all concepts and self–identifications are stripped away, suggesting that true understanding may lie beyond conceptualizations.
</li><li><b>Voice as a Storyteller</b>: Leo explains that we often trust the internal voice that tells us who we are, likening it to a storyteller. He compares beliefs induced by this voice–such as identifying with the body–to fictional concepts like Santa Claus or imaginary scenarios.
</li><li><b>Authenticity of the Internal Voice</b>: Leo challenges the notion that the internal voice is an unquestionable truth. He suggests it is capable of creating falsehoods and fictional narratives, similar to how it can fabricate the concept of Santa Claus or a two–headed horse.
</li><li><b>Identification with the Body – An Illusion?</b>: He questions whether our identification with our body and self–image is just as artificial as imagining oneself in a tropical paradise. Leo implies that these identifications could be mere constructs of the mind, not factual reality.
</li><li><b>Exploring Self Beyond the Voice</b>: Leo prompts viewers to contemplate their existence outside of the voice's constructs. He explains that understanding what we are, outside of the internal dialogue and self–image, is deeply profound and unexpected.
</li><li><b>The Voice's Method of Constructing Self</b>: Leo breaks down the process of self–construction by the internal voice, demonstrating how constant internal dialogue and images create and reinforce our sense of "I" and self–identity.
</li><li><b>Our Conceptual Self–Image</b>: He brings attention to the mental self–image and how it influences our self–identification, proposing the idea that feelings within the body might simply be perceptions, not indicative of our true selves.
</li><li><b>Validity of Internal Concepts</b>: Delving deeper, Leo interrogates whether the internal concepts we hold, including our physical self–awareness, are simply constructed stories no more real than our imagined concepts, such as the back of our head.
</li><li><b>Trusting the Internal Voice</b>: He scrutinizes the automatic trust we place in our internal voice, suggesting we examine its reliability and explore the possibility that its labels and definitions of reality might be arbitrary constructions.
</li><li><b>Label Maker Analogy for the Voice</b>: Leo analogizes the voice to a label maker, continuously producing labels, including the fundamental "I" label, creating a "smokescreen" concealing our true selves.
</li><li><b>Seeing Beyond Labels</b>: He discusses the potential of mindfulness or consciousness to experience truth beyond the voice–generated labels. Leo suggests a form of being the truth, rather than just seeing it, that transcends the current label–reliant understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Dissolution of Inner and Outer Worlds</b>: By questioning the inner–outer world distinction, he posits that our perceptions and the reality of things could merge into one unified existence, with the implication that the self as a distinct entity could also dissolve in this unity.
</li><li><b>Challenging Dissolution</b>: Leo acknowledges the difficulty in dissolving deeply ingrained delusions about self, as this process requires a profound disillusionment with one's life, which the internal voice fiercely resists.
</li><li><b>Perception Without a Perceiver</b>: He concludes with the intriguing notion that existence may not need a distinct perceiver, such as a "self," suggesting that perceptions and existence might be intrinsically intertwined.
</li><li><b>Empirical Investigation of Perception</b>: Leo Gura posits the controversial idea that the common belief in a distinct perceiver behind perception might be false. He challenges viewers to engage in a deep empirical investigation to explore the possibility that reality doesn't necessitate a separate perceiver but instead could be a seamless experience where perception and existence are one.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of a Separate Self</b>: Through a series of probing questions, Leo suggests that the notion of a separate entity that observes reality could itself be an illusion. He urges viewers to trace back the origins of perception in reality, hinting at the potential realization that there is no actual 'you' distinct from external reality.
</li><li><b>Questioning Logic and Intuition</b>: Leo challenges the limitations of human intuition and logic, especially in understanding the nature of reality. He discusses quantum mechanics and cosmology to demonstrate how reality often defies our commonsense expectations and deeply–held intuitions about how things 'should be.'
</li><li><b>Philosophy vs. Empirical Inquiry</b>: Leo shares his disillusionment with purely philosophical inquiry, which he describes as inconclusive and circular. He expresses his enthusiasm for the potential unity of perception and existence, illustrating the possibility of empirical inquiry leading to tangible realization about the nature of self and reality.
</li><li><b>Connection between Psychological Problems and False Self</b>: Leo claims that many of life's troubles stem from identifying with the false self perpetuated by the inner "voice." He argues that dismantling this false self can liberate an individual from various psychological afflictions and perceived life barriers.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Enlightenment Journey</b>: Leo invites viewers to join him on a journey that promises not just philosophical insight but also practical personal development. He encourages participation in his program, which aims to guide individuals toward enlightenment and freedom from self–imposed mental barriers.
