        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ojC0HlclnW0' target='_blank'>Using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs To Self-Actualize</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to Maslow's Hierarchy</strong> : Leo introduces the concept of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, describing it as a pyramid which individuals are expected to ascend as they grow and develop psychologically. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0QthSDQh/216-Using-Maslow-s-Hierarchy-of-Needs-To-Self-Actualize-Image-1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physiological and Safety Needs</strong> : The first two levels of the pyramid are identified as physiological needs (such as air, food, water, sex, excretion) and safety needs (including physical safety, employment, and resources for sustenance). </li>
<li><strong>Love, Belongingness, and Esteem Needs</strong> : As one ascends the pyramid, the next tiers involve love and belongingness (good friendships, family, sexual intimacy) and esteem needs (self-esteem, confidence, peer respect, and achievements). </li>
<li><strong>Self-Actualization and Self-Transcendence</strong> : The pinnacle of Maslow's hierarchy involves self-actualization (morality, creativity, acceptance of facts, truth, awareness, and contribution) and the additional aspect of self-transcendence, which is related to true spirituality and enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Stagnation at Lower Hierarchy Levels</strong> : Leo highlights that society is stunted with most people trapped at the lower levels of the hierarchy, leading to gaps even in foundational issues like employment and safety, which prevents them from working towards self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Assessing Personal Gaps in the Hierarchy</strong> : He recommends a self-assessment to identify which needs are fulfilled and which are lacking, revealing that many might struggle with aspects as basic as sex, safety, or employment. </li>
<li><strong>Implications of Unfulfilled Lower Needs</strong> : People who do not address lower hierarchy needs cannot focus on higher-level aspirations like creativity or societal contribution, leading to a life of poor awareness and mediocre contributions to society. </li>
<li><strong>Path to Success through Fulfillment of Needs</strong> : Leo suggests that success should be redefined as growth and expansion rather than just comfort and luxury. Achieving success creates a foundation for higher self-actualization and self-transcendence. </li>
<li><strong>Tragedy of Unidentified Gifts and Talents</strong> : The lack of identification and development of personal gifts and talents leads to a lack of passion, resulting in mediocre jobs, missed opportunities for mastery and significant contributions to society, and overall unfulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Lofty Goal of Raising Awareness</strong> : Less than 1% of the population is focused on raising awareness, a goal that seems too lofty for those stuck at the bottom of the hierarchy and therefore contributes to a low-quality society. </li>
<li><strong>The Essential Role of Life Purpose</strong> : Without a life purpose and passion, people fail to achieve self-actualization, leading to a life lacking deep meaning, significance and the inability to impact society positively. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose as a Missing Puzzle Piece</strong> : Leo stresses life purpose as a key element missing in people's lives and emphasizes that finding one's passion is vital to living a fulfilled life and making significant societal contributions. </li>
<li><strong>Illustrative Anecdote of Prioritizing Needs</strong> : Leo shares a hypothetical scenario of a man fleeing a tiger but stopping to write poetry, demonstrating the intuitive understanding of the prioritization of needs inherent in Maslow's hierarchy. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of Success</strong> : Leo describes how many people misconceive success as acquiring luxury or comfort, such as buying a high-rise apartment or a yacht. He argues that this common view is a misuse of success. </li>
<li><strong>Success as Growth and Expansion</strong> : For Leo, the true definition of success is about personal growth and expansion. He emphasizes that real fulfillment is achieved not through a cushioned life but by reaching the stages of self-actualization and self-transcendence. </li>
<li><strong>Success Enabling Self-Actualization</strong> : He points out that without achieving a degree of success, people will struggle with petty concerns and won't be able to pursue higher levels of fulfillment or understand the deep concepts he shares in his videos. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Benefits of Individual Success</strong> : According to Leo, once people achieve personal success, they often desire to contribute to society. He views success not only as a personal achievement but as a societal necessity that can address many of the world's problems through increased awareness. </li>
<li><strong>The Necessity of Success in the 21st Century</strong> : Leo stresses that in the contemporary era, becoming successful is essential to prevent global catastrophes and to leverage the opportunity to improve the world significantly. </li>
<li><strong>Systematic Effort to Ascend the Hierarchy</strong> : He encourages his audience to systematically address gaps in their personal hierarchy of needs, implying that for most, a gradual approach of resolving each deficiency is a sound strategy towards self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Two Principal Questions for Personal Development:</strong> Leo prompts viewers with two questions: 1) "Where am I stuck on the hierarchy?" and 2) "What must I do to get myself unstuck once and for all?", urging them to identify and tackle the major obstacle impeding their progress. </li>
<li><strong>Embracing Self-Transcendence</strong> : He explains that self-transcendence is the ultimate purpose of life and warns against forsaking this objective after achieving material success and comfort. </li>
<li><strong>Ideal Life Strategy for Fulfillment</strong> : Leo outlines an ideal life strategy, suggesting spending early adulthood securing foundational needs and then dedicating later years to self-transcendence, a path he believes will result in the most profound fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Life Purpose Course</strong> : He mentions his course designed to help people find their life purpose, talents, and how to translate these into a dream career, which he deems a significant step towards self-transcendence. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a Resource</strong> : Leo promotes Actualized.org as a platform offering strategies, courses, and motivation to embark on the marathon-like journey toward self-actualization and self-transcendence. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Lifelong Regret</strong> : Finally, Leo emphasizes his goal to prevent people from dying without having reached the pinnacle of the hierarchy, equating such an end with a profound sense of regret and unfulfillment.</li>
