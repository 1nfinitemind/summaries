            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/HZm4B4foybM' target='_blank'>How To Stop Caring What People Think Of You</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Personal Struggle with People–Pleasing</b>: Leo shares his own battle with caring too much about what others think, a struggle that stemmed from cultural adjustments upon moving from Russia to the US as a child. He describes feeling out of place and constantly assessing how others perceived him. This issue became a life–long motif, which he has only recently started to overcome by developing new mindsets.
</li><li><b>Foundation of People–Pleasing in Maintaining Self–Image</b>: Leo identifies the root of people–pleasing as the desire to maintain a noble self–image. He explains how people–pleasers construct an idealized version of themselves and seek constant validation from others to confirm this image, leading to unnecessary stress and emotional disturbance.
</li><li><b>Empathy as a Trap for People–Pleasers</b>: Leo cautions that for some, empathy can become a debilitating trap. He explains that people–pleasers often suppress their inherent selfish nature to prioritize others, leading to resentment and emotional conflict.
</li><li><b>The Middle Way Alternative</b>: Leo introduces the 'middle way' as an alternative to the extremes of being an uncaring individual and a self–sacrificing people–pleaser. This approach promotes independence from others' opinions while maintaining one's own values as the guiding force.
</li><li><b>The Unsustainability of People–Pleasing</b>: Leo highlights the flaw in people–pleasing, labeling it as unsustainable. He argues that one cannot fulfill their own values, agendas, and nature if they're constantly trying to appease others.
</li><li><b>Advocating for Authenticity Over Approval</b>: Leo urges viewers to embrace authenticity rather than seeking approval. He encourages living true to one's values and dreams, arguing for a life path that is independent of others' capricious opinions.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Acknowledge Flawed Strategies</b>: Leo pushes viewers to recognize the ineffectiveness of seeking constant approval. By admitting and abandoning their approval–seeking strategies, individuals can start pursuing a more fulfilling and self–determined life. 
</li><li><b>Redefining Worth Independently</b>: Leo emphasizes that true personal value and fulfillment are not derived from others' opinions but by living one's potential, and creating a life aligned with one's personal values and dreams.
</li><li><b>Exercise to Foster Independence from Opinions</b>: He presents a practical affirmation exercise aimed at fostering independence from the opinions of others. Leo suggests repeating the affirmation, "I am completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of others," daily to reprogram one's mindset.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on the Choice Between Self–Image and Authentic Living</b>: Leo points out the conflict between maintaining a perfect self–image and living out one's dreams. He encourages choosing authenticity and personal dreams over a flawless image and recommends his affirmation exercise as a tool to aid this transition.
</li><li><b>Final Advice on Letting Go of People–Pleasing Habits</b>: Leo concludes by advising viewers to let go of the exhausting and unfulfillable pursuit of pleasing everyone and instead focus on expressing their unique values and visions, even if it breeds societal tension.
</li><li><b>Neglecting Personal Values and Dreams</b>: Leo points out that constant people–pleasing pushes one's own values and dreams aside, inhibiting personal growth and the ability to positively impact the world. This occurs as individuals lose focus on their personal agenda, overly worried about others' perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Flawed People–Pleasing Strategy</b>: He condemns the people–pleasing strategy as ineffective and calls for its abandonment, arguing that it doesn't lead to success because it is centered around the impossible task of controlling others' opinions.
</li><li><b>Absurdity of Relying on Others' Opinions</b>: Leo challenges viewers to reflect on the absurdity of letting a thought–a figment of someone else's imagination–control their life. He stresses the lunacy of being swayed by strangers' thoughts and opinions, even in fleeting interactions or presentations to unfamiliar audiences.
</li><li><b>Self–Empowerment through Grounded Values</b>: He proposes that the solution is to get grounded in one's own values, pursue personal happiness and fulfillment, and disregard both negative criticism and positive praise from others, focusing instead on what one believes is right and fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Feedback vs. Validation</b>: Leo differentiates between seeking genuine feedback and seeking validation to prop up one's self–image, indicating that the latter is rooted in emotional neediness, fear, and neuroticism.
</li><li><b>Realization and Independence</b>: He urges viewers to admit that their existing strategy of seeking approval is flawed and to strive for complete independence from the good or bad opinions of others, thereby empowering oneself to stay true to personal dreams and values.
</li><li><b>Ineffectiveness of Upholding an Ideal Self–Image</b>: Leo highlights that maintaining a perfect self–image and controlling others' opinions is an impossible and exhausting game. He notes that opinions are random and usually say more about the critic than the person being criticized.
</li><li><b>Independence from Praise and Criticism</b>: He urges listeners to adopt a mindset where neither praise nor criticism sways them from their life's trajectory. Criticism should not trigger them, and praise should not be a necessity for their validation.
</li><li><b>Opinions Reflect the Critic, Not the Recipient</b>: Leo points out that opinions are often a reflection of the personal circumstances of those expressing them and not a measure of the recipient's worth or the quality of their work.
</li><li><b>Asking Critical Questions about One's Life Vision</b>: He encourages viewers to question whether they want to base their life's dreams and visions on the randomness of others' opinions, suggesting that dependence on such factors will prevent an extraordinary life.
</li><li><b>Realization of True Value Beyond Opinions</b>: Leo shares his realization that no human being can offer true value in the form of external validation; real fulfillment comes from one's personal journey, living up to their values and potential.
</li><li><b>Exercise for Psychological Independence</b>: He proposes a 90–day exercise where individuals affirm their independence from others' opinions through daily repetition, to reprogram their minds towards self–reliance rather than seeking constant external approval.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Negative Perceptions</b>: Leo states it's acceptable for others to have poor perceptions of you, and that such opinions should not impact one's sense of worth or deter them from expressing themselves authentically.
</li><li><b>Authenticity Generates Tension</b>: He argues that authenticity often causes tension but this tension is preferable to the strain on one's soul from sacrificing self–expression for the sake of others' approval.
</li><li><b>Tough Choices for Visionaries</b>: Leo stresses the importance of choosing between a ‘shiny' self–image and the pursuit of one's dreams, advocating for focus on personal values over worrying about critics and naysayers.
</li><li><b>Embracing Independence from Validation</b>: He guides viewers through a repetition exercise emphasizing independence from others' opinions, which he believes will lead to greater fulfillment and a more robust sense of self.
</li><li><b>Reprogramming the Subconscious Mind</b>: Leo emphasizes that repeating the affirmation "I am completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of others" for 90 days can dramatically shift one's psyche. He reassures that this change will not turn someone into an insensitive person but rather will help them find a balance between empathy and assertiveness.
</li><li><b>Not Turning into a Cold–Hearted Person</b>: He clarifies that the exercise is not meant to strip away empathy or make someone cold–hearted. It's tuned for people–pleasers, not individuals with a severe lack of empathy, and is about not caring excessively rather than not caring at all.
</li><li><b>Addressing People–Pleasing as a Losing Game</b>: Leo points out that even if one were to please everyone perfectly, hatred and criticism would still arise from others. He states that it's vital to recognize people–pleasing as a losing game and to release the grip on maintaining a flawless self–image.
</li><li><b>Developing a Thicker Skin with Success</b>: He observes that with more success and assertiveness comes more attention and, consequently, more criticism. Leo suggests that developing a thicker skin and releasing the need for a pristine self–image is key to dealing with the increased scrutiny.
</li><li><b>Exercise to Challenge People–Pleasing</b>: Leo proposes an exercise to stand in line during a busy time, like at a Starbucks, and take an uncomfortably long time to place an order. This confronts the desire to please and helps one to withstanding societal pressure.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Authenticity and Independence</b>: He reflects on his own experience as a content creator, having weaned off both condemnations and commendations to develop self–reliance. He advocates for viewers to practice authenticity and ground their responses in their own values instead of societal expectations.
</li><li><b>Encouraging Mindfulness and Going Against the Grain</b>: Leo calls for viewers to become conscious of moments when they're inauthentic or putting others' needs before their own, and to actively push back against society's expectations.
</li><li><b>Final Thoughts and Call to Action</b>: In conclusion, Leo encourages the viewers to stop caring excessively about what others think. He asks viewers to comment, like, and share the video. He also promotes his newsletter, offering exclusive content designed to help individuals live more authentically and achieve a fulfilling life.
