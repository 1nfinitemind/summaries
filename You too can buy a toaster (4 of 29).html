            <ul>
    <li><b>Life of questioning</b>: Leo espouses a lifelong inclination to questioning things and seeking a deeper understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment at a young age</b>: He had his first enlightenment experience at 21 and has since lived with the awareness that such profound experiences are attainable.
</li><li><b>Challenges in empathy with others</b>: Leo recognizes that his unique experiences may limit his ability to empathize with others who have lived differently, yet he still connects with the universal human condition.
</li><li><b>Insight from a psychic</b>: A psychic encounter prompted Leo to consider whether he was truly allowing himself to be who he was meant to be, despite his efforts to transcend himself.
</li><li><b>Engaging with conventional life</b>: After realizing he hadn't participated in typical life activities, Leo chose to start a business and date to understand what he had been abstaining from.
</li><li><b>Epiphany with the toaster</b>: The simple realization that he could buy a toaster opened his mind to normal activities and material possibilities that he had previously not considered part of his world.
</li><li><b>Analogy between enlightenment and discovery</b>: Leo compares the revelation of being able to purchase a toaster to the process of enlightenment, where the recognition of a new possibility opens up previously unseen worlds.
