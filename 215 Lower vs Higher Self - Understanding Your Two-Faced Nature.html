            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/MZFty-eM6Rk' target='_blank'>Lower vs Higher Self - Understanding Your Two-Faced Nature</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Two Modes of Being</b>: Leo explains the dichotomy of the 'lower self' and 'higher self.' The lower self constitutes our reactive, base instincts fuelled by fear, pettiness, and selfishness, whereas the higher self reflects our ability to be calm, noble, and selfless. He likens this duality to a light switch that can be flipped in any given situation, sending us from a higher to a lower state of being.
</li><li><b>The Boundary Concept</b>: Leo introduces the concept of an invisible boundary separating the lower self from the higher self, which gets threatened when we ourselves feel threatened. Many people cross this boundary unconsciously, leading to harmful decisions and actions.
</li><li><b>Introducing Eben Pagan's Insight</b>: Leo credits Eben Pagan for the insight on the boundary between the lower and higher self. He emphasizes that often disastrous life decisions and actions are borne from the lower self–usually without the individual's conscious awareness of this transition.
</li><li><b>Physical and Subtle Threats</b>: Leo moves on to differentiate between physical dangers that can trigger the lower self–like facing imminent harm–versus more subtle triggers surrounding money, family, intimate relationships, careers, and reputation. These subtle triggers often go unrecognized but have profound impacts on behavior.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Personal Triggers</b>: He urges recognition of personal, idiosyncratic triggers that can switch someone from their higher self to their lower self. Identifying these requires mindfulness, and he suggests maintaining a journal to help record and recognize these instances.
</li><li><b>Introduction to the Emotional Body</b>: During a meditation retreat, Leo learns about the 'emotional body' and the key role it plays in transitioning between states of self. He describes an experience where wasps flying near him provided a live 'science experiment,' allowing him to observe his emotional body's activation in real–time.
</li><li><b>Observing the Emotional Body in Real–Time</b>: Witnessing his emotional reactions to the wasps and the accompanying mental images during meditation, Leo demonstrates the significant importance of being able to perceive the activation and deactivation of the emotional body to master one's responses to various threats.
</li><li><b>Mediation and Awareness in Emotional Regulation</b>: Leo concludes highlighting the importance of being able to sense when and how the emotional body gets activated and suggests that developing such awareness through meditation can be a pivotal skill in managing responses to threats and stress.
</li><li><b>Experience of Emotional Charge During Work</b>: After a work session, Leo notices a significant emotional charge within himself, likening it to being lit up like a Christmas tree. This sensation was mostly unrecognized until he transitioned into a break and practiced mindfulness.
</li><li><b>Meditation as a Tool for Emotional Regulation</b>: It took Leo a couple of minutes of meditation to begin calming the emotional energy within his body, emphasizing the practical benefits of meditation beyond just mental calmness. Regular practice helps to identify and manage emotional build–up before it becomes overwhelming.
</li><li><b>Incremental Build–up to Lower Self</b>: Leo explains that emotional escalation doesn't immediately plunge someone into their lower self. It typically starts small and intensifies step by step until it becomes like an avalanche – powerful and uncontrollable. This is the point at which one's lower self takes over.
</li><li><b>Preventative Power of Observation</b>: The act of simply observing the early signs of emotional escalation can have a dissipating effect, preventing the snowball of negative emotions from turning into an avalanche. When these emotions go unobserved, they can lead to being blindsided by one's lower self.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness Exercise with External Threats</b>: Leo suggests practicing mindfulness near a wasp nest as a self–experiment in observing emotional reactions to threats. However, he acknowledges not everyone can do this exercise, so alternative mindfulness activities are necessary.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Avoid Decision–Making in Lower Self</b>: Leo stresses the importance of committing to not make decisions while in the lower self. He advises building awareness to recognize when this shift happens, using techniques such as journaling and meditation to improve this awareness.
</li><li><b>Detachment from Others in Lower Self</b>: An action step Leo recommends is disengaging from interactions with others when one senses being in the lower self to avoid negative and selfish behavior. Informing others about one's state can help manage the situation better.
</li><li><b>Mindful Observation After Stressful Activities</b>: Leo suggests taking a brief meditation break after work to observe and contrast one's stress levels before and after the meditation, enhancing one's ability to detect stress signals within the body.
</li><li><b>Structural Changes to Avoid Triggers</b>: He advises altering one's life structure to minimize triggers that can lead to a lower self–state. This may involve moving to safer areas, changing jobs, or making other environmental and situational changes.
</li><li><b>Unwiring Triggers Through Self–Help and Therapy</b>: Seeking therapy, coaching, or utilizing self–help resources can help identify and unwire triggers that have deep emotional roots, often stretching back to childhood.
</li><li><b>Regular Personal Development Practice</b>: Leo encourages making personal development a consistent habit, such as reading, watching educational videos, or engaging in discussions about personal growth to foster continuous improvement.
