        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yIsbVpBJ110' target='_blank'>How To Escape Wage Slavery</a></h1>
        <p><em>"I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if they knew<br />
they were slaves." - A misquote of Harriet Tubman</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition and nature of wage slavery</strong> : Wage slavery is characterized by doing meaningless, grinding work solely for subsistence, such as paying bills and providing for basic needs, which prevents individuals from engaging in meaningful, creative contributions to society. </li>
<li><strong>Society's ignorance of enslavement</strong> : Most people are not aware of their slavery within the system. It often takes years to realize one's enslaved status, and understanding this is crucial for the possibility of escape. </li>
<li><strong>Dysfunctional societal work</strong> : A significant portion of people's lives is devoted to unfulfilling and often harmful work that doesn't utilize their full potential or contribute meaningfully to society's advancement. </li>
<li><strong>Unconscious creation of harm</strong> : Workers unknowingly contribute to negative societal impacts by following orders from superiors, aiding in their wealth accumulation at the expense of ethical considerations. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of unconscious contributors</strong> : Various professions unknowingly further harmful agendas, including programmers for defense contractors, HR in exploitative healthcare corporations, cashiers at fast food chains, and many others. </li>
<li><strong>Feeling disempowered and responsible</strong> : Many feel they have no choice but to do the work they're doing and thus relinquish any sense of responsibility for the broader implications of their labor. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding society as a pyramid scheme</strong> : Society is structured with power and wealth at the top, and this unequal distribution is by design rather than happenstance. </li>
<li><strong>Historical context of slavery</strong> : Physical slavery has only recently been outlawed in some societies, but other forms of slavery persist. Civilization's rise involved tribes enslaving each other, with government being the modern equivalent of control. </li>
<li><strong>Society as a power game</strong> : Those with power are in constant pursuit to accumulate more, and the ego's insatiable need for survival drives this power battle, where those at the bottom lose power and opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Government's role in domestication</strong> : Individuals are domesticated by government, not through a conspiracy, but as an unconscious result of societal structure that maintains extreme inequality. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural and educational indoctrination</strong> : Culture and the education system brainwash individuals from a young age to accept and defend the status quo, even when it does not serve their interests. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of wealth</strong> : Wealth is about power disparities rather than just material possessions. For one to be wealthy, others must be left with less power and resources. </li>
<li><strong>Wealth accumulation and exploitation</strong> : The pursuit of wealth often involves exploiting and manipulating others, demonstrating that society's structure perpetuates inequality where the elite at the top of the pyramid scheme benefit from the work of wage slaves. </li>
<li><strong>Relative nature of wealth</strong> : Wealth is about power disparities; to be wealthy is to have the ability to make others do things for you without reciprocation. Wealth is only meaningful within a societal system that enables these power dynamics. </li>
<li><strong>Myth of the fair playing field</strong> : The common narrative that hard work alone leads to wealth is largely a fantasy. The market is not truly a level playing field, and the structure of society prevents everyone from reaching the top due to its pyramid shape. </li>
<li><strong>The structure of the societal pyramid</strong> : Real wealth accumulation comes not from individual hard work or creativity but through exploitation, manipulation, and existing close to sources of traditional wealth, which are often industries with inherent power structures. </li>
<li><strong>Corporate ladder and power disparity</strong> : Climbing the corporate ladder leads to wealth because it increases power disparity. The system is designed so that as you climb higher, automatic exploitation occurs, giving those at the top power over the masses. </li>
<li><strong>Syndicates and secret networks</strong> : Wealth isn't just money but also includes insider knowledge and trade secrets. Syndicates are exclusive networks within industries that cooperate to accumulate power, exploit others, and protect their wealth and information. </li>
<li><strong>Wealth control and inheritance</strong> : Most wealth is controlled by a few and is often passed down to relatives and friends through structures like estate taxes, further entrenching the societal pyramid. </li>
<li><strong>Social connections and status in wealth acquisition</strong> : Gaining wealth also heavily relies on manipulating societal structures, exploiting government connections, and having social status and fame, which themselves contribute to one's wealth. </li>
<li><strong>Denial of the pyramid scheme</strong> : Both those at the top and bottom of society often deny the existence of the pyramid structure. The privileged justify their position based on hard work and intelligence, ignoring their advantages and luck, while those at the bottom remain unaware or in denial. </li>
<li><strong>Privilege and good fortune</strong> : Many who are wealthy owe their status to fortunate beginnings&mdash;including genetics, upbringing, networking, and education&mdash;advantages not afforded to everyone. </li>
<li><strong>Ego's disregard for truth</strong> : The ego prioritizes survival above all else, including fairness and truth, leading to a system where exploitation, manipulation, and deceit are common and persistently denied by those benefiting from them. </li>
<li><strong>Status quo and societal acceptance</strong> : People tend to accept the societal pyramid because it's the status quo and they have grown complacent. Many cannot fathom life at the very bottom and remain unaware of the harsh realities experienced there, especially in third-world countries. </li>
<li><strong>First-world privilege through exploitation</strong> : Wealthy nations, particularly America, have achieved prosperity largely through exploiting third-world countries while simultaneously denying and whitewashing these actions to maintain a positive national image. </li>
<li><strong>Societal dysfunction akin to abusive families</strong> : Society's denial of systemic issues is compared to how dysfunctional families deny abusive behaviors, with ideologies like conservatism and libertarianism often used to justify and maintain societal inequalities. </li>
<li><strong>Critique not anti-capitalist</strong> : Leo clarifies that his critique of societal structures is not an anti-capitalist rant, stressing his approval of entrepreneurship and business as parts of the solution for individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Survival taken for granted</strong> : Modern society obscures the harsh realities of survival, with many disconnected from the unethical practices that may underpin their livelihood, such as unknowingly working for or with companies involved in harmful acts. </li>
<li><strong>The pyramid's inescapability</strong> : Regardless of attempts to leave the societal pyramid through monastic life or accumulating wealth, one remains part of the structure, which is ingrained in human civilization and is seen as logical and necessary for survival. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance and responsibility</strong> : Instead of rejecting the societal pyramid out of denial or moral judgments, individuals should accept its existence, understand their place within it, and take responsibility for their roles and actions. </li>
<li><strong>Rarity of Financial Freedom</strong> : Financial freedom is highlighted as extremely rare, with Leo suggesting that people need to recognize its value and rarity. He likens it to purchasing a million-dollar house, which requires planning, strategizing, and work as opposed to a small, easy purchase. </li>
<li><strong>Root of Wage Slavery</strong> : Leo attributes becoming a wage slave to not knowing what you want in life, lacking a sense of purpose, vision, intention, independent thought, and desire. He criticizes the waste of youth on frivolous activities rather than building skills to avoid wage slavery. </li>
<li><strong>Escaping Wage Slavery with Two Strategies</strong> : Leo details two strategies to escape wage slavery: one is to be highly creative, hardworking, with a powerful vision and becoming a massive value provider; the second is manipulating the system to rise to the top. However, he recommends the first option due to ethical considerations and personal fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Taking Full Responsibility</strong> : Emphasizing responsibility, Leo suggests fully owning your life situation and developing the necessary skills to change it. He urges listeners to figure out what they want from life with a clear, long-term vision. </li>
<li><strong>Becoming a Leader</strong> : The necessity of transitioning from following to leading is underpinned, including guiding oneself, others, taking greater responsibility, and forging independently ahead. </li>
<li><strong>Massive Value Provision</strong> : Leo discusses the need to train and provide extraordinary value compared to others as a strategy to break free from wage slavery. Value in this context is creative, original solutions to problems, which often attracts the payment necessary to buy one's freedom. </li>
<li><strong>Value Through Creativity and Original Solutions</strong> : The importance of creativity in providing value is stressed, with the reminder that society, technology, and culture always evolve, necessitating new solutions to remain valuable and relevant. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Having a Clear Life Purpose</strong> : Leo underlines the importance of having a clear life purpose to determine one's unique contribution and fuel the journey to mastering skills necessary for providing substantive societal value. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Cookie-Cutter Solutions</strong> : Leo advises against seeking out templated solutions for career and business, pushing for personal creativity to devise a unique path and contribution. He emphasizes the need for original thought and a unique approach to providing value. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution and Individual Contribution</strong> : Leo emphasizes that humans are part of the evolutionary process and by not pushing evolution forward, one becomes a wage slave, assisting others' ideas instead of leading change themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Leadership and Individual Power</strong> : He strongly advocates for taking back personal power and becoming a leader, not relying on others like him for leadership but leading oneself and others with unique and original visions. </li>
<li><strong>Creativity as a Pillar of Existence</strong> : Leo highlights the significance of creativity, describing it as a manifestation of all existence. He stresses the joy of being a conscious part of the creative process rather than abdicating creative power like most wage slaves do. </li>
<li><strong>Becoming a Creator</strong> : He proposes that becoming a highly creative individual feels god-like and is a central pillar to an enjoyable life, encouraging viewers to tap into their potential and become conscious creators. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Continuous Learning</strong> : Leo points out the necessity of learning from available resources to push oneself to new levels of creativity in various fields, acknowledging the universal and spiritual aspects of creativity. </li>
<li><strong>Studying Entrepreneurship, Marketing, and Sales</strong> : He advises that mastering entrepreneurship, marketing, and sales is key to escaping wage slavery, with plenty of resources available for those committed to changing their lives. </li>
<li><strong>Finding Your Niche</strong> : Emphasizing the importance of research, Leo suggests looking for a unique niche that distinguishes one's work from others, regardless of the field one chooses. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement of the Societal Pyramid</strong> : Leo acknowledges that not everyone can escape wage slavery due to society's pyramid structure, and many choose not to due to lack of vision or unwillingness to overcome obstacles. </li>
<li><strong>Complacency and Personal Choice</strong> : He recognizes that many people are complacent and may choose to remain wage slaves, finding satisfaction in simple, undemanding jobs that don't challenge them. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Privilege and Avoiding Complacency</strong> : Leo encourages gratitude for not being a physical slave and highlights that modern-day wage slavery often results from one's mental slavery which can be altered, urging people to take responsibility for their own mindsets. </li>
<li><strong>Helping Others by Leading</strong> : He argues that by escaping wage slavery oneself and becoming a leader, one is better positioned to elevate society than by commiserating with those who choose to remain wage slaves. </li>
<li><strong>Setting Goals to Escape Wage Slavery</strong> : Leo recommends setting a goal to escape wage slavery, which can lay the foundation for personal development and conscious living while also providing the freedom to pursue one's own values and projects. </li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Life Purpose</strong> : Leo advocates that beyond financial independence, the real achievement is aligning with one's life purpose, offering massive value to humanity, and elevating it in a meaningful way. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Individual Value</strong> : Personal value is highlighted by proposing a life goal where thousands would mourn your absence due to the cease of value provision, which emphasizes the utilitarian nature of personal relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of Offering Value</strong> : The goal is to offer such immense value and leadership that people would feel a profound loss without your contributions, indicating a crucial societal role. </li>
<li><strong>Financial Security through Value</strong> : If one reaches the point of offering significant value and leadership, financial concerns are minimized, as societal contributions will ensure financial stability. </li>
<li><strong>Hard Work for Escaping Wage Slavery</strong> : To escape wage slavery, one must expect hard work, loneliness, suffering, confusion, and feeling stuck as part of the journey to eventually gain freedom for personal pursuits. </li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Escaping Wage Slavery</strong> : Despite the goal of escaping 'wage slavery,' achieving freedom requires intense initial effort with the promise of greater leisure and fulfillment after the hard work. </li>
<li><strong>Pyramid Structure Wisdom</strong> : Leo emphasizes the wisdom of the societal pyramid structure, which allows for those desiring leadership to rise above those content with being followers. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose Course</strong> : Leo introduces his Life Purpose Course, designed to help discover values and purpose, emphasizing that it's not a get-rich-quick scheme but a 'rich slow scheme' based on principles for establishing a creative career. </li>
<li><strong>Principle-Based Approach</strong> : He stresses that the course is based on timeless principles rather than exploitative schemes, though it requires significant work for actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose Course Impact</strong> : Testimonials attest to the course's life-changing impact, while Leo reflects on his evolution over the last five years and underscores the importance of gratitude. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Approach to Living</strong> : The aim of Actualized.org and Leo's teachings is the creation of an amazing life, encompassing enlightenment and spirituality, as well as practical aspects of earning a conscious living. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Beyond Enlightenment</strong> : While enlightenment is paramount, Leo also points out the value in consciously designing a way of making a living and contributing positively to mankind. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Actualized.org</strong> : The platform seeks to address a variety of life facets &mdash; like relationships, health, and career &mdash; integrating them holistically to create a fulfilling life, which distinguishes Actualized.org from other narrowly-focused teachings.</li>
