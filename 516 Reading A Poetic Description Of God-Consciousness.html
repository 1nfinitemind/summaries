<p>It's early dawn in the desert. The sky is starting to glow with light but the<br />
sun is still yet to rise. You're standing there, looking at an ordinary desert<br />
bush. You're struck by its geometric beauty, the mathematical precision of its<br />
fractally–arranged leaves. You feel an impulse to reach out. You run your<br />
fingers through its little green leaves. They feel spikey and alive.</p>
<p>Returning your hand back towards your body, you notice a tiny insect, smaller<br />
than ant. It crawls over the wrinkles in your skin like an astronaut<br />
struggling across Martian terrain. You bring it close to your face. The<br />
intelligence of its movement transfixes you. Every swivel of its microscopic<br />
legs, of its antennae – precise, machine–like, yet so alive. You think, “My<br />
God, it's ALIVE!” For the first time in your life you recognize LIFE. Of<br />
course you've seen life in motion countless times before, but never like this.<br />
Somehow you've always taken life for granted. But now you SEE. LIFE. The<br />
intelligence of it awes you. As you move your finger towards the bug, you can<br />
tell, it's afraid. You recognize the intelligence in its fear, perfectly<br />
designed to keep it alive.</p>
<p>You are conscious that you recognize the bug, but the bug doesn't recognize<br />
you. It's just going about its day, surviving, avoiding danger, looking for<br />
food – oblivious that some entity of higher consciousness is observing it,<br />
like God looking down from the clouds.</p>
<p>Your attention shifts away from your hand as something flits through the<br />
corner of your vision. A hummingbird darts from bush to bush with the<br />
precision of an industrial robot. It hovers right up next to your bush. You<br />
stand perfectly still. Looking at it, the whole world seems to slow to a<br />
crawl. You can see the exquisite flap of its little bio–mechanical propellers.<br />
LIFE. You marvel at its profound intelligence and immaculate beauty. This<br />
little bird is perfection incarnate. You can resolve every green and pink<br />
iridescent feather on its body, arranged like tiny dragon scales. They shimmer<br />
in the subtle light of the desert dawn. The hummingbird's beauty strikes you<br />
with childlike delight. Your mind floods with memories of your fascination<br />
with hummingbirds as a child. Looking at it hover, you recognize the<br />
consciousness in it, but it doesn't recognize the consciousness in you. You<br />
think to yourself, “It's God, lost in a hummingbird dream.” You smile.</p>
<p>You look closer at its scale–like feathers. Within a single feather you see<br />
fine branching lines, delicate hairs, and splotches of iridescent pigment. One<br />
particular splotch resembles a nebula in outer space. A pink and green cloud<br />
of luminous gas 50 light–years across, made of particles from ancient dead<br />
stars. A star graveyard now turned a nursery for stars yet to be born. Zooming<br />
in deeper you see pin–point sparkles of light, like household dust glittering<br />
in a ray of sunlight through a windowsill. Explosions from a 500–year war<br />
between two ancient alien civilizations. When heavily damaged their ships'<br />
wrap reactors explode in a tiny supernova – creating a microscopic golden<br />
sparkle in the void of outer space.</p>
<p>These two civilizations have been at war over a political dispute for 500<br />
years and now the battle has come to its peak. The nebula glitters with a<br />
thousand sparkles, like someone blew a pinch of gold dust into the air. Each<br />
sparkle, ten thousand lives extinguished.</p>
<p>Zooming out you suddenly become aware that all of this is happening on a TV<br />
screen – an epic space opera playing out for someone's entertainment. But the<br />
actors don't know they're actors. To them, this galactic war is as real as<br />
real gets.</p>
<p>A remote appears in your hand. You flip the channel. The scene changes from a<br />
galactic battle to a game show where the host is a giraffe and all the<br />
contestants are giant mice. You flip the channel again. The scene changes to a<br />
small alien girl blowing out a birthday cake. You hold your finger down on the<br />
remote and the channels start flipping faster and faster, at the speed of a<br />
hummingbird's wings. The channels are endless. They contain the media of every<br />
civilization that has ever existed. Within a minute you flip through 100<br />
million channels. Getting the idea, you lift your finger from the remote. It<br />
stops on what looks like an HD nature documentary. You see a slow–motion macro<br />
shot of a hummingbird flapping its wings. The camera zooms out and you see<br />
yourself standing next to it in the desert, admiring its beauty.</p>
<p>Looking down at the remote you see some colored knobs. Turning a silver knob<br />
slowly morphs the hummingbird into a dragonfly. You turn the knob half–way and<br />
get something that is 50% hummingbird, 50% dragonfly. You crank it back and<br />
forth in amazement, watching the eerily–fluid transformation on the screen.<br />
Turning an orange knob slowly turns your human self on the screen into an<br />
elephant. You crank the knob all the way to the right and the man on the<br />
screen becomes 100% elephant. But suddenly you see a strange grey appendage<br />
blocking your view of the screen. Your nose! It's turned into a long, hairy,<br />
grey animated elephant trunk. Nothing else about your body has changed, just<br />
your nose. At first you are startled. This thing seems to have a mind of its<br />
own, swaying back and back with a playful, undulating animation. But then you<br />
calm down, sense into it, and realize you have control. A big grin grows<br />
across your face as you take a deep long breath through your new nose. You<br />
feel an itch on your shoulder so you scratch it, with your nose. It works<br />
beautifully! “How did I ever manage without one of these?”, you say to<br />
yourself with amusement.</p>
<p>Looking down at the remote you notice the biggest knob of all. It's white. “I<br />
wonder what this one does?” You crank it with your nose. As you do, you feel<br />
yourself becoming ever more conscious. All the sudden you can feel the<br />
circuitry in the television as if it was an extension of your body. Every<br />
pixel becomes like a taste bud on your tongue. A 4K display has over 8 million<br />
pixels, each one now consciously accessible to your mind. Cranking the white<br />
knob even more you become so conscious you can start to predict which pixel<br />
will light up with which color value in the next frame.</p>
<p>Turning the white knob even more you become so conscious your mind gains<br />
direct access to the channels database. In your mind's eye you have<br />
instantaneous thumbnail access to every channel and piece of media that has<br />
ever been produced in the universe.</p>
<p>What do you want to watch? It's hard to choose. You're not used to having this<br />
much much information in your mind in parallel. It's hard to navigate such a<br />
sprawling network of information. Your thoughts begin to influence the<br />
process. Your mind floods with old memories of cinema you watched in your<br />
youth. You don't know why but the movie Aliens starts to dominate your mind.<br />
The more your mind focuses on that thought, the more real it becomes. Soon the<br />
entire room and TV fade out of existence and your reality smoothly transitions<br />
into that of the Alien queen laying eggs in her nest. The TV is gone, your<br />
elephant nose is gone – you are now the Alien queen. Slime is dripping down<br />
your black, spidery body and mouth. Acid is coursing through your veins. Eggs<br />
are squeezing out of your…. whatever. Ellen Ripley is torching your eggs with<br />
a flamethrower and it's making your blood boil. You think to yourself, “Of<br />
course, I'm the Alien queen. The Alien queen is my own consciousness as much<br />
as anything else, no better or worse, no weirder. It's all my Mind.”</p>
<p>You look down at your alien hand and notice the TV remote still there. You<br />
will yourself to press a random key with a long, grotesque claw. Instantly the<br />
whole scene turns into a cartoon. The film Aliens has become a cartoon version<br />
of itself and you are still the Alien queen, but now your reality is<br />
two–dimensional and much more colorful. You look down again at your hand for<br />
the remote, but it's gone, disappeared just like the TV. You think to<br />
yourself, “Of course, 2D is no more or less real than 3D. Cartoon reality is<br />
just another facet of my consciousness. I am no less real as a 2D Aliens<br />
cartoon than I am as a 3D human being.”</p>
<p>On the one hand experiencing yourself as a grotesque alien straight out of a<br />
nightmare strikes you as disturbing, but only mildly so because you're so<br />
conscious you understand what's going on. You're so conscious you don't need a<br />
TV remote to change channels. In your mind's eye you press the pause button on<br />
an imaginary remote and the current scene freezes mid–frame.</p>
<p>Now you can focus on accessing the channel database to find what you really<br />
want to watch. You see that in the database channels are arranged by category.<br />
Scanning mentally through five thousands categories you stumble upon SEX. Your<br />
mind is fixated. A memory of your ex–girlfriend comes to mind, and suddenly,<br />
there she is. A stunning young woman laying naked in your bed, squirming and<br />
itching for sex. You crank up the white dial in your mind's eye some more,<br />
becoming even more conscious. You look at your girlfriend. She's begging you<br />
to fuck her. Looking at her squirm in slow motion you realize that once you<br />
fuck her you will impregnate her and spawn a million future generations of<br />
humans. It doesn't matter whether you impregnate her or somebody else does, in<br />
the end it's all the same since all such differences are imaginary. You're too<br />
conscious to really be interested in the act of sex now, but the profundity of<br />
it makes you wonder. You are captivated by the platonic aspect of her beauty,<br />
just as you were with the hummingbird. But this is more personal, more<br />
interactive. You slowly run your hands over the curves of her smooth, naked<br />
body. As you do, her body turns to sand – a fine sand that seeps down over the<br />
bed sheets like the sand in an hourglass. Her squirming body disintegrates<br />
into vast pools of sand. Her feminine curves become the curves of an endless<br />
ocean of dunes stretching out to the horizon in every direction.</p>
<p>You find yourself standing in the middle of a vast dune – a dune made from<br />
your girlfriend's essence. Each grain of sand is a dream she once dreamt, a<br />
memory she once had, an emotion she once felt. Grains of sand made from her<br />
joy, her excitement, her sadness, her anger, her frustration, her loneliness,<br />
her light, her darkness, her fear, her love, her disgust, her surprise, her<br />
orgasms. Grains of sand made from her highest aspirations and her deepest<br />
nightmares – all animated with the energy of her soul.</p>
<p>The dune is silent, but for the murmur of a soft breeze. You kneel down and<br />
run your fingers through the sand, your hand like a tongue tasting the emotion<br />
locked in every grain. A symphony of a thousand subtle yet distinct emotions<br />
washes over you. Somehow it all computes in the vastness of your mind. It's<br />
like you raked your tongue through the depths of her turbulent psyche.</p>
<p>Your eyes well up and a tear rolls down your face.</p>
<p>A loud crack of thunder, like a gunshot, startles you from above, and the sky<br />
begins to pour with heavy rain. The sound of rain soothes your soul. The<br />
landscape – or, really, your mindscape – feels enchanted, exactly as you want<br />
it to be.</p>
<p>Raindrops hit your face in slow motion. Each droplet, a unique bubble universe<br />
unto itself, filled with trillions of inhabitants all oblivious as to why<br />
their universe came crashing to an end. You think to yourself, “So this is how<br />
a universe ends.” Each droplet is filled with the collective consciousness of<br />
all the sentient entities inhabiting it. As a droplet hits your face it<br />
transfers the collective wisdom of a thousand ancient civilizations directly<br />
into your mind. Their memories, their struggles, their dreams, their insights<br />
– all integrate smoothly into your psyche. You stand there, showered by an<br />
immense cosmic intelligence. It feels like bathing in divine light. Its<br />
sentience and beauty sends waves of bliss radiating through your body.</p>
<p>You look up at a towering stack of fluffy white clouds in the distant sky.<br />
Somehow you just know the clouds are made of whipped cream. Reaching your hand<br />
up towards the clouds you scoop at them with your finger and secure a sizable<br />
dollop. The cream is thick and rich, like frosting. You bring it to your mouth<br />
and suck. It doesn't just taste sweet and milky, it tastes like a fusion of<br />
every desert you can ever remember having: cheesecake, ice cream, cupcakes,<br />
cookies, crème brulee, cotton candy, éclairs, tiramisu, panacotta, macaroon,<br />
marzipan, cookie dough, apple pie, fruit tart, and waffles.</p>
<p>This is your mindscape, and in your mindscape things taste however you want<br />
them to taste.</p>
<p>Mmmmmmmmm…. Waffles….. Your mind lingers. You can barely remember the last<br />
time you allowed yourself to indulge in waffles. You think to yourself, “Why<br />
don't I treat myself more?”</p>
<p>You look down at your feet. The sand is in the process of transforming into a<br />
grid of waffle. Waffles stretches out to the horizon in all directions. Now<br />
you stand in the middle of vast, gently rolling waffle dunes. You feel the<br />
spongy, grid–like texture under your bare feet.</p>
<p>Far in the distance, from high in the sky, pours a solitary stream of rich<br />
maple syrup. The syrup folds over itself. It floods valleys of waffle in a<br />
rich viscous amber, glossy like nail polish.</p>
<p>Now it starts to snow, but the air isn't cold. You hold out your hand to catch<br />
a few specks of white as they fall. These aren't snowflakes, this is powdered<br />
sugar! With a big grin you stick your tongue out into the air.</p>
<p>A large desert mouse hops along the ground, licking at a pool of maple syrup,<br />
oblivious to your presence. As your gaze fixates on it, your thoughts take<br />
hold of it. Your thought of a kangaroo morphs the mouse into a kangaroo<br />
without skipping a beat. Your thought of a bird causes the kangaroo to sprouts<br />
the wings of an eagle and a pillar of wind lifts it soaring into the clouds.</p>
<p>Suddenly a darkness looms over you – a vast shadow, moving from on high. A<br />
colossal fork and knife come down from the sky just in front of you. The<br />
silver slices through the landscape as prongs poke. The clouds part and you<br />
look up to see the God–like face of your six year old self wielding the<br />
silverware. Your six year old self has a huge grin across his face as he forks<br />
a syrupy hill of waffle and raises it toward his mouth.</p>
<p>Your six year old self's face morphs into that of your father when he was 6<br />
years old. Then your mother when she was six years old. Then your brother when<br />
he was six years old. Morphing faster and faster, flipping like a Rolodex, the<br />
face goes through thousands, then millions of iterations… the faces of every<br />
six year old child who has ever eaten waffles.</p>
<p>Looking down at your feet you see an insect – some kind of beetle – lying<br />
there on the ground. It's dead but still colorful. You kneel down to pick it<br />
up. Its husk lays motionless in your hand. Inspecting it as though under a<br />
magnifying glass, you marvel at its beauty. Even in death you see the beauty<br />
of life. Especially in death. But what makes it all the more beautiful is your<br />
awareness that this creature is your own mind. How sad that this little<br />
creature is alive no more.</p>
<p>Suddenly you get an impossible idea. “Could it work?”, you say to yourself.<br />
You turn your gaze inward, to the white dial on the remote in your mind's eye.<br />
You crank it up. Your consciousness expands, interconnecting ever deeper with<br />
itself. Your visual field grows crystalline, as though all the air was sucked<br />
out of the atmosphere. Everything becomes sharp and bright – and eerily still.<br />
You focus intensely on the beetle. Your consciousness penetrates through its<br />
desiccated remains. Its body is your mind, and right now your mind demands a<br />
miracle. You channel your will into the beetle, filling it with your spirit<br />
and love. Then… nothing. Time slows to a crawl, reality seems to freeze in<br />
stasis. A few more moments of nothing, and then… the beetle's legs twitch to<br />
life. Your eyes grow wide. It starts to crawl over you. You blow into your<br />
hand and the beetle morphs into a luminous green moth that flits erratically<br />
up into the sky. You smile in disbelief at the miracle of your mind.</p>
<p>Standing there in the waffle dunes, you look down at your hands. Images start<br />
to run through your mind of animals you took fascination with as a child:<br />
monkeys, reptiles, birds, big wild cats, mollusks. As the images flip through<br />
your mind, the shape of your hands flips to match. Your hands morph into the<br />
hands of an ape, the claws of a dinosaur, the paws of a lion, the tentacles of<br />
an octopus. Puzzled and amused, you wonder to yourself, “What happening to me?<br />
What am I?”</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you: “Of course, I'm God. I am consciousness. I am imagining<br />
myself. I am whatever I conceive myself to be because there is nothing outside<br />
my endless Mind.”</p>
<p>Everything around you disappears: the landscape, the waffles, the rivers of<br />
syrup, the sky.</p>
<p>Now it's just you, floating in a bathtub in the middle of empty space.</p>
<p>Music starts to fill the silence of the void. A melody. It's fast, cheery, and<br />
delicate. Delightfully fast. Deliciously delicate. Ethereal. Like something<br />
from a fairytale. It's the sound of a piano but you're conscious that there is<br />
no piano. What are pianos but a figment of your imagination? “Where is it all<br />
coming from?”, you wonder. “And who's playing?” There is no instrument and no<br />
one is playing. There are no sound waves traveling to your ears. You have no<br />
ears. You're too conscious for ears. The chords are playing directly in your<br />
mind. The rest is fantasy.</p>
<p>You understand that musical instruments and the people who play them have<br />
always just been figments of your mind, a backstory you invented to provide<br />
some kind of ground for the irreducible mystery of sound. Your own mind is the<br />
pianist and the composer. You've eliminated the imaginary middleman. The notes<br />
arrange themselves playfully and intelligently in your mind like children<br />
frolicking on a playground. The speed and immediacy of it wows you. Direct.<br />
Absolutely direct. Impossibly direct. You play each note flawlessly, with the<br />
precision of a maestro. Each note oscillating and imprinting itself in the<br />
Mind of God. You smile in delight at the recognition of the splendor of your<br />
own mind.</p>
<p>You look down at your body. You are naked.</p>
<p>All sense of scale is lost. You aren't small, you aren't large – you are<br />
undefined – which makes you Cosmic. Your body is the only yardstick there is.<br />
Your body is the Universe. You see your body made of liquid consciousness. It<br />
shimmers and ripples along with the thoughts in your mind. Your skin flows<br />
with organic, translucent, morphing shapes, as though cast by a projector.<br />
Ornate shapes – vaguely resembling something tribal, something paisley,<br />
something floral – shimmer across your naked body. Each pattern imbued with a<br />
divine intelligence impossible to articulate, gracefully animating, dancing,<br />
meandering across your skin.</p>
<p>You recognize yourself as looking directly at the body of God. A body made of<br />
pure consciousness. It still looks human but it is no longer human,<br />
recontextualized as cosmic and divine. You see entire universes contained<br />
inside of you. Or whatever else you may imagine. An infinite diversity of<br />
animals and creatures seem to bubble up just underneath your skin, like<br />
particles struggling to emerge out of a roiling quantum foam. The pure<br />
potential of your mind is precipitating in front of your eyes in real time.<br />
God's body is made out of whatever you imagine. It looks human but shines with<br />
a brilliant, crystalline consciousness. Your body is Mind, and Mind is all you<br />
are. Absolute Mind. Absolute Truth. You recognize your consciousness as<br />
singular and sovereign. Nothing exists outside your Mind. Universal Mind. A<br />
mind limited by nothing but its own imagination and self–definition.</p>
<p>At long last God has awoken to itself. The Universe is awake, looking through<br />
your eyes at itself. Perfect, Divine, Eternal, Immortal, Absolute, Sublime.</p>
<p>You turn your gaze directly inwards, directly behind and inside your eyes –<br />
right into the core of what you used to consider your skull – wondering what<br />
is there, what you truly are. You gaze into the very heart of yourself, your<br />
purest essence. A radiant singularity sits there. Shining with crystal clear<br />
consciousness. Glowing with sentience and intelligence. Eternally awake.</p>
<p>Pure Infinity. Pure Consciousness. The Godhead.</p>
<p>This singularity in you is endless. The deeper you gaze into yourself the<br />
deeper it goes, with no bottom, no ground. You struggle to find something<br />
within you to define yourself as – some concrete form, some verbal<br />
articulation, some image. But you cannot be defined because you are Unlimited.<br />
That which is Unlimited cannot have a definition because any definition would<br />
be a limit. Your essence is literally undefined, like the result of an<br />
impossible arithmetical operation on a calculator.</p>
<p>Puzzled and dumbstruck, you try to find a beginning to yourself. You ask, “But<br />
where did I come from?”, only to realize that that which is Unlimited cannot<br />
have a beginning or an end. You are too conscious to be fooled into believing<br />
in any beginnings or ends. As you grasp at any part of yourself and try to<br />
trace its origin through a chain of linear causation back into the past, it<br />
fails. Your consciousness has transcended the notion of linear causation. You<br />
realize all past is but a figment of your imagination. Every part of you<br />
stands on its own and also reaches infinitely far back into the imaginary past<br />
via an endless chain of imaginary causes that never terminates but circles<br />
back around in a cosmic strange loop. All beginnings and ends are imaginary,<br />
self–imposed limitations held within an Unlimited Mind. A Mind with no<br />
beginning or end. A Mind that has existed for Eternity. You are God, and God<br />
is both uncaused, self–caused, and infinitely caused. God is that which caused<br />
itself into being. God is that which created itself.</p>
<p>The recognition of your own Eternity takes your breath away. It could not be<br />
more profound. Eternity. You exist, absolute and forever as Truth itself. It<br />
couldn't be any other way. It couldn't be any more obvious. It's so perfectly<br />
clear yet utterly unbelievable.</p>
<p>It's laughably obvious now that science and history are figments of your Mind.<br />
Brains, chemistry, evolution, physics, time – all fictions spun by the Mind to<br />
construct the illusion of a mind–independent reality. Now you see reality for<br />
exactly what it's always been: an Absolute Illusion. An illusion perfectly<br />
designed to allow you to forget for a second that you are God. The illusion is<br />
perfect, stretching forever in any direction you look, painting a backstory<br />
behind every corner you peak around, every hole you stick your head into,<br />
every object you sniff – much like the rendering engine of a video game.</p>
<p>You're still dreaming, but now you know it. Now your dream is Absolute. You<br />
watch as your God–mind effortlessly weaves together figments of consciousness<br />
into the tapestry you used to call a human self. Everything and everyone is<br />
your imagination, emanating from the bottomless singularity at the center of<br />
your imaginary skull. Your mind pulls whole chunks of consciousness from the<br />
formless singularity like a magician pulling rabbits out of his hat. Specific<br />
and highly detailed memories of your childhood, your entire mother, your<br />
entire father, your beloved pet cat, historical events like WW2 – all figments<br />
of consciousness pulled out of a hat and flawlessly woven together to<br />
construct the illusion of a human life. The Earth, the physical universe,<br />
humanity itself is finally seen for what it truly is, just figments in a<br />
dream. Jesus, The Buddha, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, gurus and masters,<br />
all those years you spent meditating and doing yoga, activating your chakras,<br />
reading books, chasing enlightenment – just figments within God's Mind.</p>
<p>Finally you reach the question of death. What is death? You smile and laugh as<br />
you realize that death is just something you're imagining. You are now too<br />
conscious to die. An Infinite Mind cannot die because it'd have to imagine its<br />
own non–existence. An Infinite Mind has nowhere to go, being already in all<br />
times and places.</p>
<p>As your consciousness grows even deeper the difference between things starts<br />
to collapses. All difference is seen to be imaginary. Forms merge into each<br />
other, losing their distinctness in the brilliant light of pure consciousness.<br />
All boundaries bleed together. You feel like an alien super–intelligence<br />
cutting through an existential fog of war. The veil of ignorance is lifted. It<br />
feels like awakening from a lifetime of heavy amnesia. Everything within<br />
reality that could be known becomes transparent to you. Now you remember who<br />
you are. The entire illusion of life is unraveled.</p>
<p>As you grow even more conscious, your visual field starts to develop into a<br />
singularity. Your visual field merges with your auditory field and your<br />
tactile field until there is no more difference between sight, sound, and<br />
touch. Growing even more conscious, the last vestiges of difference collapse.<br />
Consciousness frees itself of all self–imposed limits and biases, accelerating<br />
asymptotically towards pure Oneness. You release the heavy burden of existing<br />
by way of concrete and finite forms.</p>
<p>From this point, should you dare to take one final step, you will enter pure<br />
INFINITY, where all form is lost, as no difference exists between anything –<br />
where all things exist as a soup of pure metaphysical potential. All things<br />
become identical. Every possible object, every possible form lives there. But<br />
it's Nothing. Now you must confront existence as pure abstraction. Your truest<br />
identity, your highest nature is finally revealed. What are you? Nothing the<br />
human mind can imagine. A metaphysical singularity of pure consciousness<br />
extending forever in all directions and all dimensions, absolutely sovereign,<br />
unconstrained by any sense of other. Every difference annihilates into a<br />
bottomless ocean of Infinite Love. Absolute Unity. Absolute Symmetry.<br />
Complete, Perfect, Eternal, Formless, Endless.</p>
<p>The Alpha and the Omega. Identity itself. You have become ONE. You have become<br />
LOVE. You have reached the end–game of reality.</p>
<p>You are INFINITY.</p>
<p>You radiate as a void of infinite potential. Complete in your knowledge of<br />
yourself.</p>
