            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/JZqEMok_NXw' target='_blank'>The Root Solution To People Pleasing & Loneliness</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Self–Help Advice Advancement</b>: Leo realizes profound and simple solutions to the common issues of people–pleasing and loneliness, based on recent advancements in his own consciousness and epiphanies.
</li><li><b>Childhood Development</b>: He discusses childhood development, comparing it to animal behavior, and how acculturation and social assimilation are necessary for functioning in society, albeit with some negative consequences.
</li><li><b>Extrinsic Reward Mechanisms</b>: Leo points out that as we grow, we develop extrinsic reward mechanisms seeking approval, love, and satisfaction from others instead of finding happiness within, which leads to people–pleasing and a lack of true fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Personal Example of Grade–Based Reward</b>: Sharing his own experience, Leo describes how he associated self–worth with academic achievement, which later left him feeling empty when there were no more grades to achieve, demonstrating the pitfalls of external validation.
</li><li><b>Gender and People Pleasing</b>: He argues that women are often more susceptible to becoming people pleasers due to their social and nurturing inclinations, which can trap them into a continuous cycle of seeking approval and validation.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic Reward Mechanism Solution</b>: Leo suggests reclaiming personal sovereignty by shifting the reward mechanism from extrinsic to intrinsic, short–circuiting the need for external approval by directly giving oneself love and satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Self–Validation</b>: He acknowledges the resistance one might feel to giving themselves love and satisfaction, due to societal conditioning and a sense of guilt that equates self–validation to cheating or laziness.
</li><li><b>Reclaiming Happiness and Satisfaction</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to reclaim the ability to be happy and satisfied independently of external sources, thus solving the issues of people–pleasing and continuous pursuit of conditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Shifting Focus Inside for Satisfaction</b>: By refocusing on internal sources of joy and satisfaction, Leo argues this could disrupt unhealthy patterns of people–pleasing and allow individuals to experience true deep satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Problem with External Validation</b>: Leo critiques societal standards that make individuals feel they do not deserve love unless they meet certain conditions and champions an intrinsic approach to self–worth and achievement.
</li><li><b>Ultimate Inner Fulfillment</b>: He closes by stressing the importance of finding joy in one's own experiences and existence, underscoring that the most profound satisfaction comes from within, not external achievements or recognitions.
</li><li><b>Running After Extrinsic Goals</b>: Leo notes that striving for extrinsic goals, such as increasing a company's value, leads to perpetual dissatisfaction. Even when one target is reached, the goalposts move, creating an endless loop of desire for more.
</li><li><b>Slave to Gratitude and Approval</b>: He explains the trap of needing others' gratitude and approval to feel love and happiness. Setting such a standard leads to serving others in hopes of collecting thanks, which often results in bitterness when the expected recognition is unmet.
</li><li><b>Taking Back Control over Happiness</b>: Leo advocates for taking back sovereignty and control over one's internal reward mechanisms. Relying less on others for satisfaction allows one to become their own master, bypassing the need for external treats.
</li><li><b>Non–Dual Approach to Happiness</b>: He describes a shift to non–dualism in happiness, where the boundaries between self and other are dissolved. This allows for giving happiness to oneself, seen as both more mature and more difficult to achieve.
</li><li><b>Potential of Basking in One's Own Happiness</b>: Leo challenges the idea that satisfaction must come from external success or validation. He posits that the ability to bask in one's own love and happiness could free one from societal expectations, leading to truly autonomous action.
</li><li><b>Fullness Over Neediness</b>: He contrasts behaviors from a state of fullness–overflowing with internal love and satisfaction–with actions from a state of neediness aimed at manipulating others for validation.
</li><li><b>Turning Inwards for Satisfaction</b>: Leo shares his personal journey in finding satisfaction through his work with Actualized.org. He acknowledges the issues with needing constant output for validation and his recognition that true satisfaction doesn't come from external praise or achievements.
</li><li><b>Realization of Non–Dual Achievement</b>: Discussing his deep consciousness work, he's reached insights so profound they seem unshareable. Fulfillment must come from within, as these pinnacle experiences are not always recognizable or appreciable by others.
</li><li><b>Contentment in Self–Realization</b>: Leo suggests rewiring the reward mechanism to find satisfaction in personal self–realization rather than in others' praises or helping others achieve similar insights.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic Self–satisfaction</b>: He wraps up with the idea that ultimate satisfaction and happiness don't come from outside oneself. The capacity for intrinsic self–satisfaction defines one's ability to experience high levels of joy and love without the need to share or receive external validation.
</li><li><b>Solipsistic Bubble of Self–Validation</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that turning rewards intrinsic creates a seemingly solipsistic bubble, where one is their own source of humor, happiness, and approval. This is key to overcoming loneliness, as it reduces dependency on social validation and the need for others to find joy.
</li><li><b>Thought Experiment on Being the Last Person on Earth</b>: Leo invites his audience to imagine being the last conscious entity on Earth. This scenario challenges one to find joy and satisfaction in life without external validation, underscoring an unhealthy dependency on extrinsic reward mechanisms if one cannot feel joy alone.
</li><li><b>Joy from Existence Itself</b>: He argues the deepest joy comes from appreciation of existence, not social interactions. Building a deep metaphysical connection to reality is essential for spirituality and intrinsic contentment.
</li><li><b>Combating Loneliness and People Pleasing</b>: By building a personal connection with reality and oneself, and focusing on intrinsic satisfaction, one can simultaneously address the issues of loneliness and the compulsion to please others.
</li><li><b>Empowerment through Internal Validation</b>: Leo Gura insists on gaining fulfillment and satisfaction from within, without needing others for validation, thus addressing the issues of loneliness and people–pleasing by becoming self–reliant and empowered.
</li><li><b>The Pitfall of Extrinsic Rewards</b>: He highlights the danger of building relationships based on the need to please and warns against expecting others to validate personal achievements, insisting that true satisfaction can only come from within.
</li><li><b>Retaining Social Interaction as Icing, Not the Cake</b>: Leo does not advocate for a complete disconnection from social life; rather, he encourages people to view social interactions as a complement to a life that is fundamentally grounded in self–validation and internal joy.
</li><li><b>Anonymity in Good Deeds for Self–Satisfaction</b>: He suggests conducting good deeds anonymously and keeping that knowledge to oneself as a powerful way to foster inner satisfaction and reinforce one's intrinsic value and goodness.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self–Reflection and Solitude</b>: Leo advises slowing down and dedicating time to solitude and self–reflection to appreciate one's own goodness, which most people overlook in the rush of life. Recognizing one's own value is crucial for authentic self–gratitude.
</li><li><b>Attaining an Ideal State of Consciousness</b>: Leo envisions reaching a state of consciousness where simply existing in a room provides complete satisfaction. This reflects a profound spiritual development where appreciation for mere existence brings immense joy and is considered the ultimate level of bliss.
</li><li><b>Rushing Through Life</b>: Leo discusses how people rush through daily activities like working and caring for kids, only allowing themselves happiness when they feel productive. However, he points out that such external activities distract from the deeper joy of existence and should not be the source of happiness.
</li><li><b>Cultivating Inner Satisfaction</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of finding happiness within oneself instead of through chores or productivity. He suggests sitting quietly and basking in existence for intrinsic satisfaction, unassociated with external achievements.
</li><li><b>Perception of Dysfunction in Self–Satisfaction</b>: Gura addresses the concern that focusing on self–satisfaction may seem selfish or dysfunctional. He counters this by stating that the true dysfunction is seeking happiness through pleasing others, and that being content in oneself is a healthier approach.
</li><li><b>Balanced Social Interaction</b>: Leo explains that retreating into oneself to find happiness can initially lead to solitude but ultimately allows one to return to society from a deeper, more fulfilled standpoint. From this place, interactions are not driven by need but by overflow of love and selflessness.
</li><li><b>Overcoming People–Pleasing with Selfishness</b>: He offers the controversial view that selfless deeds come after a period of focused selfishness, using the Buddha's story as an example. He stresses that deep self–love and self–realization is necessary before one can genuinely help others.
</li><li><b>Authentic Selflessness and the Fallacy of People–Pleasing</b>: Gura critiques the flawed perception of selflessness in people–pleasers, especially women in unhealthy relationships. He argues for realizing love and goodness as innate, not actions done for others.
</li><li><b>Egoic Conditions for Happiness</b>: He discusses the ego mind's use of conditions to motivate survival activities and rejects the notion that seeking unconditional happiness is delusional. He claims that awakening to our existence and recognizing our inherent goodness is the path to true satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Materialism and Sovereignty</b>: Gura criticizes materialism as a flawed approach to finding satisfaction and happiness. He advocates reclaiming sovereignty and appreciating existence independently to address the core issues of people–pleasing and loneliness.
</li><li><b>Embracing Solitude for Inner Joy</b>: Gura encourages practicing solitude to enjoy activities alone without external validation. He believes that by traveling, eating out, and experiencing life alone, one builds genuine happiness that can enhance shared experiences later.
</li><li><b>Satisfaction from Solitary Experiences</b>: The emphasis is on allowing solo experiences to be fulfilling and using the contrast between solitude and companionship to appreciate both intensely. Gura states that this is essential for authentic sovereignty and enjoyment in life.
</li><li><b>Profound Appreciation of Existence</b>: Gura's ultimate goal is guiding viewers towards a profound appreciation of existence and reality, a process that requires years of personal effort and cannot be outsourced or expected from others who may not value it as deeply.
</li><li><b>Long–Term Cultivation of Joy</b>: Cultivating self–love and satisfaction is likened to muscle training, promising a unique level of joy that, while not sharable with others, leads to a sense of completion and eradicates feelings of being unlovable.
</li><li><b>Self–Love Solution</b>: To counter feelings of unworthiness, Leo advises actively giving oneself love, reaching a point of realization that one is the embodiment of love, thus solving self–esteem issues and the dependency on external validation for love.
</li><li><b>Ego and Happiness</b>: As the ego utilizes love and happiness for survival, one must take control of their own satisfaction and happiness, recognizing the intrinsic beauty around them, rather than solely focusing on survival which never truly leads to happiness.
</li><li><b>Infinite Love from Within</b>: Consciousness instinctively seeks to reunite with its true nature, which is infinite love and beauty. External validation is seen as a poor substitute for the recognition of one's own divine nature, which when realized is the root solution to people–pleasing and loneliness.
</li><li><b>Practical Steps to Divine Nature</b>: Engaging in practices that allow for the realization of one's divine nature–love, goodness, absolute truth–is crucial for becoming more present, grounded, and appreciative of the world around oneself, which in turn fosters a deep metaphysical connection with reality.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Common Existence</b>: Shifting perspective to see profound intelligence, beauty, and connection in everyday objects, like a dinner fork, can lead to a satisfying appreciation of life's design and one's place within it.
</li><li><b>Resources for Self–Discovery</b>: Leo points viewers to resources such as his book list, life purpose course, blog, and forum to aid in the journey towards recognizing and valuing their divine nature. He emphasizes the importance of using these tools to address problems at their root for long–term improvement.
</li><li><b>Investment in Profound Life</b>: Highlighting self–help's depth, Leo advocates for serious and committed personal development to have a profound experience of life, stating that the benefits of deep, long–term work outweigh the effort and surpass the effectiveness of shallow solutions.
