            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/KV7dHrc_r9g' target='_blank'>Why Men Cheat - And 8 Ways To Keep Your Man Loyal</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Why Men Cheat</b>: Leo addresses the question of why men cheat and aims to provide women with a deeper understanding of male attraction, as he believes that many women lack a true understanding of what men find appealing.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions on Male Attraction</b>: It's highlighted that women often misconstrue what men find attractive, with many believing men prioritize confidence, humor, or a woman's life success, when in fact, men are primarily visually driven and attracted to physical appearance.
</li><li><b>Sexual Nature of Men</b>: Leo emphasizes the strong sexual drive in men, especially those in the age range of their 20s to 40s, and points out that men are much more visual and sexually driven than many women assume.
</li><li><b>Instantaneous Male Attraction</b>: He describes that a man can become attracted to a woman almost instantly, based on visual cues alone, and that a delayed attraction might indicate a lack of genuine interest.
</li><li><b>Opportunities for Men to Cheat</b>: Men have more opportunities to become attracted due to the instant nature of their attraction, which is not the case for women who require more time and interaction to develop attraction.
</li><li><b>Evolutionary Drivers in Attraction and Cheating</b>: Leo suggests that evolutionary forces are at play in human attraction and cheating, driving both sexes to seek out the highest–value mate they can attract.
</li><li><b>Human Need to "Date Up"</b>: Both men and women have the desire to partner with someone they perceive as higher value, leading to challenges if one's partner is significantly higher in value and thus always on the lookout for better options.
</li><li><b>Natural Human Polyamory</b>: He posits that humans are not naturally monogamous but polyamorous, which can impact the stability of monogamous relationships, although it's not impossible to maintain them.
</li><li><b>Ensuring Monogamy</b>: Leo aims to share strategies that might decrease the chances of cheating in a relationship, although he acknowledges that it can never be fully guaranteed.
</li><li><b>Leo's Intention with the Video</b>: The ultimate goal of the video is to help women gain insight into how men think, with the broader objective of fostering happiness and success through understanding and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Long–Term Relationship Challenges</b>: Creating lasting relationships is difficult because humans are not naturally wired for long–term monogamy, creating a tension between our instincts and societal expectations.
</li><li><b>Sex–Related Reasons for Cheating</b>: The top three reasons for men cheating relate to the quality and frequency of sex:
</li><li>1. <b>Bad sex</b>: Unfulfilling sexual experiences can lead to infidelity.
</li><li>2. <b>Stale sex</b>: Even previously good sexual relationships can degrade over time, increasing the risk of cheating.
</li><li>3. <b>No sex</b>: A complete lack of sexual activity in a relationship is a strong indicator of dysfunction and can lead to cheating.
</li><li><b>Physical Attractiveness and Cheating</b>: Men's visual nature means that significant weight gain or neglect of one's appearance by their partner can lead to a loss of attraction and increase the temptation to cheat.
</li><li><b>Passion and Excitement</b>: The absence of non–sexual passion or excitement in a relationship can contribute to infidelity as the relationship may feel stale.
</li><li><b>Opportunistic Sex</b>: Men can be highly tempted to cheat if sex is readily available with little effort, particularly if offered by someone they find attractive.
</li><li><b>Trading Up</b>: Men may cheat if they perceive an opportunity to be with a partner who they consider to be of higher 'value' or more attractive than their current one, especially if they believe the value gap is large.
</li><li><b>Alcohol and Impulse</b>: Intoxication can impair judgment and lower inhibitions, leading to increased chances of cheating, especially in social, alcohol–fueled environments.
</li><li><b>Bad Character</b>: Some men cheat not because of dissatisfaction with their relationship but due to inherent dishonesty and immoral character traits.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Relationships</b>: To reduce the risk of infidelity, ensure the sexual relationship is satisfying, maintain physical fitness and attractiveness, keep the relationship exciting, and choose a partner with good character. Avoiding paranoia and accepting that cheating is a part of human nature are also advised for a healthier perspective on relationships.
</li><li><b>Leo's Intentions with Actualized.org</b>: The goal is to provide knowledge and mindsets for a fulfilling life across various aspects like relationships, careers, and personal growth.
