            <ul>
    <li><b>John Wooden's philosophy on success</b>: Leo discusses the importance of mastering basic skills using the analogy of coach John Wooden's simple yet fundamental teaching method. Wooden emphasized on basics like putting on socks and tying shoelaces to ensure his players were free from distraction, exemplifying how basic skills are pivotal to later success.
</li><li><b>Unexpected simplicity in health</b>: People often dismiss basic health advice, thinking it too elementary for more profound areas like enlightenment work. Leo explains that without a solid foundation in something as simple as healthy food shopping, one cannot hope to perform at their best in other areas of life.
</li><li><b>Misleading societal education on food</b>: Leo criticizes how society and educational systems fail to teach proper nutrition, instead promoting harmful eating practices. He claims that from elementary school onwards, people are trained to consume the "wrong" foods, leading to serious health consequences.
</li><li><b>Food manufacturers as 'Devils'</b>: Leo asserts that food manufacturers knowingly sell harmful products, spending billions on marketing to entice consumers, which contributes to various health issues and dependencies.
</li><li><b>Adoption of a healthy diet for comprehensive well–being</b>: By following Leo's guidelines for healthy food shopping, one can significantly improve their health and avoid weight concerns without needing to rely on gym workouts.
</li><li><b>Core harmful food groups</b>: Targeting wheat, dairy, sugar, corn, soy, and artificial additives, Leo outlines these as primary contributors to allergic reactions and autoimmune diseases, which are often triggered or exacerbated by poor diet choices.
</li><li><b>Autoimmune diseases and their prevalence</b>: Over 50 million Americans diagnosed with autoimmune diseases suffer due to undiagnosed conditions and incorrect treatment, often rooted in improper diet rather than genetic predisposition alone.
</li><li><b>Common diseases and their nutritional links</b>: Leo suggests many common conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, and ADHD, are far more related to one's diet than commonly acknowledged by healthcare providers.
</li><li><b>Fundamentals of selecting food</b>: The focus should be on the ingredient list rather than calorie or fat content. Leo advises looking for food with five or fewer natural ingredients listed in descending order by quantity to ensure healthier choices.
</li><li><b>Avoidance of misleading health labels on products</b>: Consumers should not assume products are healthy based on front label claims but should instead read ingredient lists to verify the product's quality and avoid preservatives and chemicals.
</li><li><b>Fresh and Raw Food Preference</b>: Choose food that deteriorates quickly, indicating raw, fresh, and alive produce; food lasting years on the shelf likely lacks nutritional value.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Processed Oils</b>: Steer clear of hydrogenated fats and complex oils; stick to natural oils like olive, coconut, and avocado oil for health benefits.
</li><li><b>Sugar and Corn Syrup</b>: Vigilantly check ingredient labels as a vast majority of supermarket items contain high amounts of sugar or corn syrup; these should be avoided.
</li><li><b>Boxed and Processed Foods</b>: Opt for freshness over convenience; boxed and processed foods are generally lower quality than fresh, perishable items.
</li><li><b>Preservatives and Colorants</b>: Avoid foods with complex preservatives and artificial coloring which can be detrimental to health.
</li><li><b>Cheap Meat and Eggs</b>: Look for quality in meat and eggs; the higher cost often indicates better and more ethical farming practices.
</li><li><b>Plants with Pigments</b>: Consume colorful, pigment–rich plants which provide enzymes and antioxidants that combat ageing and help repair cells.
</li><li><b>Cooked vs. Raw and Organic</b>: Lean towards organic foods and those that are minimally cooked with single ingredients for optimal nutritional value.
</li><li><b>Misleading Food Labels</b>: Ignore meaningless labels like "cage–free", "vegetarian–fed", "antibiotic–free", "hormone–free", and "all–natural" as they do not guarantee healthy or organic products.
</li><li><b>Trans Fats Mislabeling</b>: Be wary of "no trans fats" claims and scrutinize ingredient lists since companies often manipulate portion sizes to meet labeling requirements.
</li><li><b>Fat–Free and Low–Fat Fallacies</b>: Disregard "fat–free" and "low–fat" labels; fats can be healthy, but these labels may signal the addition of unhealthy ingredients like excess sugars.
</li><li><b>Calories and Sugar–Free Misconceptions</b>: "Low calorie" and "sugar–free" do not equate to healthiness; these products may contain harmful chemicals and additives.
</li><li><b>Trustworthy Labels</b>: "Organic", "grass–fed", "pasture–raised", "vegan", "dairy–free", "gluten–free", "soy–free", and "non–GMO" are reliable labels with strict regulation standards.
</li><li><b>Prohibited Grocery Items</b>: Eliminate sodas, vitamin waters, pasteurized juices, bread, wheat products, bakery items, pasta, cereals, and all dairy for better health management.
</li><li><b>Danger of Modern Wheat</b>: Recognize that modern wheat can harm digestion and trigger autoimmune diseases; eliminating wheat can lead to significant health improvements.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Dairy</b>: Understand that many people have unknown sensitivities to proteins in dairy; cutting out dairy can help alleviate acne and autoimmune reactions.
</li><li><b>No More Sweet Yogurts and Soy</b>: Avoid sweetened yogurts, corn–based products, and soy which can be genetically modified and cause allergic reactions or hormonal imbalances.
</li><li><b>Frozen Meals and Chips</b>: Refrain from buying frozen meals, chips, deli, and canned meats, which are packed with preservatives and low–quality ingredients.
</li><li><b>Protein Supplements Caution</b>: Be cautious with protein supplements like whey protein, protein bars, and shakes as they can be difficult to digest and cause health issues like acne.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Protein Bars and Protein Shakes</b>: These items are often just candy with added protein powder, sugars, and chemicals. They do not offer health benefits and should be avoided.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Certain Seafoods</b>: Big fish like Atlantic salmon, tuna, swordfish, and mackerel can contain harmful heavy metals such as mercury. Similarly, farmed fish, primarily fed on corn, should be avoided when possible in favor of wild–caught varieties.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Caffeine and Alcohol</b>: Products like coffee and alcoholic beverages should not be part of a healthy diet due to their negative health effects.
</li><li><b>Rejecting Certain Cooking Oils and Butter Substitutes</b>: Cooking sprays, canola oil, safflower oil, and butter substitutes like margarine and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" are filled with unhealthy fats and should be replaced with healthier oils such as olive oil.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Artificial Sweeteners and Sugars</b>: Sweeteners like Splenda and aspartame, along with added sugars, should be eliminated from the diet due to their harmful effects.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Corn–Fed and Vegetarian–Fed Animal Products</b>: Meats and eggs produced from animals fed on corn or a vegetarian diet are less nutritious and should be avoided when possible.
</li><li><b>Grocery Aisles to Avoid</b>: Leo advises never to visit aisles that sell candy, deli meats, cheese, soda and juice, bread and bakery items, cereals, chips, alcohol, and protein bars. These areas are filled with unhealthy food choices.
</li><li><b>Healthy Foods to Purchase</b>: Recommendations include fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, preferably organic, as well as pure nuts and nut butters that don't contain added sugars, organic pasture–raised eggs, spices, certain condiments with no or less sugar, healthy oils (olive, coconut, avocado, flax, sesame), seaweed, olives, pickles, sauerkraut, hummus, kombucha, almond and coconut milk, gluten–free oatmeal, quinoa, rice, beans, canned meat and vegetable stocks, wild seafood, certain types of sardines, coconut yogurt, dark chocolate above 80%, raw honey, spring water, sparkling water, unsweetened tea, pre–made sushi, and whole roasted chicken.
</li><li><b>Cooking at Home and Restaurant Limitations</b>: Adhering to a healthy diet requires cooking at home since most restaurants serve dishes containing dairy, gluten, corn, or sugar. Even when eating out, choosing the right restaurants and menu items that align with a healthy diet is critical.
</li><li><b>Gradual Diet Transition</b>: Leo notes that transitioning to a healthier diet is a gradual process that can take years. He emphasizes aiming for roughly 80% adherence, allowing flexibility for social situations like dining out or travel, but being particularly strict with never consuming wheat and dairy again.
</li><li><b>Health and Consciousness Improvements</b>: By eliminating certain foods, Leo has stopped the worsening of his health conditions and improved his energy levels and consciousness, particularly benefiting practices like yoga, meditation, or using psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Longevity of Dietary Commitment</b>: Changing to a healthier diet is a lifelong commitment, aimed at overall well–being rather than temporary goals like rapid weight loss.
</li><li><b>Pre–Planning Snacks for Travel</b>: When traveling, particularly at airports with limited healthy options, Leo suggests planning ahead and bringing nutritious, portable snacks like fresh fruit or nut butters.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Weight without Gym</b>: Leo has been able to maintain his weight without gym workouts by following his diet, focusing on healthy food intake rather than quantity.
</li><li><b>Freedom from Weight Management Concerns</b>: Switching to a healthy diet can liberate one from the constant stress of weight gain and body image issues.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Weight and Health Benefits</b>: Leo has been able to maintain a slim figure by changing his diet rather than relying on gym workouts. He no longer worries about gaining weight or his body image because he's cut out fattening foods like sugar, dairy, and wheat, sticking to a diet rich in fruits and meats.
</li><li><b>Cost of a Healthy Diet</b>: Adopting a healthier diet can increase food expenses significantly–up to double the current cost. However, Leo urges reframing this as an investment in long–term health, which can lead to savings on healthcare and medicines, increased energy, and motivation.
</li><li><b>Investment in Nutrition</b>: Leo compares the current costs of eating healthy to the past when our grandparents ate 100% organic food. He suggests that while food is more affordable today, spending on good nutrition is essential, even if that means spending a higher proportion of income on food than on disposable items.
</li><li><b>Preparing Healthy Recipes at Home</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of finding quick, healthy, and well–storing recipes. Cooking at home allows for better control over ingredients, and Leo intends to share more recipes in the future.
</li><li><b>Importance for Youth</b>: He highlights the significant impact of healthy eating on high school and college students. Proper nutrition is crucial for those under 25 to prevent health issues in the future that could obstruct their ability to self–actualize and pursue their life's purpose.
</li><li><b>Personal Dietary Choices and Sacrifices</b>: Leo has forsaken pizza and other unhealthy foods for over five years. He copes with cravings by focusing on a larger vision of health and long–term benefits, which has allowed him to transition to healthier alternatives without feeling deprived.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Nutrition Resource</b>: Leo promotes Actualized.org for additional information on healthy living, including a forum, life–purpose course, and a list of recommended nutrition books to educate and inspire individuals on their journey toward improved nutrition and health.
