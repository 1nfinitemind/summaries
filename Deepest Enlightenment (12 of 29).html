        <ul>
<li><strong>Profound insights as equal</strong> : All insights through consciousness work are deemed equally profound by Ralston, with none standing out as more significant than the others, defying Leo's attempt at relative comparison. </li>
<li><strong>Feeling nothing from enlightenment</strong> : The first-person feeling of enlightenment was akin to feeling nothing at all; despite profound contemplation and achieving enlightenment, there was no compulsion to act differently by either sharing or hiding the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Absence of consideration to share</strong> : Even when accompanied by a companion after the enlightenment experience, there was no consideration or thought to share the enlightenment with him; it illustrates the non-normal operation of the mind post-enlightenment where typical cognitive behaviors like sharing didn't occur. </li>
<li><strong>Invariably positive outcome</strong> : Ralston affirms that the effect of enlightenment on the mind and the individual is consistently positive and liberating, highlighting the universally beneficial impact of such experiences.</li>
