            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/_APVC8AGt8g' target='_blank'>A Rant Against Naive Realism - Reality Is NOT Physical!</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Defining Naive Realism, Materialism, and Physicalism</b>: These terms denote a commonly held worldview where reality is assumed to be a three–dimensional space filled with objects following mechanistic laws, essentially an "objective" universe existing independently.
</li><li><b>Sensory Perception as Reality</b>: Human experience of reality is a 'phenomenal field' composed of sensory perceptions. Other organisms experience the world differently, leading to the conclusion that reality varies significantly across different life forms.
</li><li><b>Common Sense and Scientific Understanding of Reality</b>: Science acknowledges that our brains render our reality, suggesting that all perceived 'physical' objects, including our bodies, are in fact products of mental processes and not inherently physical.
</li><li><b>Consistency of Sensory Experience</b>: While our sensory field seems physical due to its consistency, this does not equate to physicality. Other animals have completely different sensory experiences, challenging our understanding of what reality truly is.
</li><li><b>The Myth of Stuff Behind the Scenes</b>: The idea that an objective reality exists independent of perception is likened to the cosmic turtle myth, illustrating the philosophical problem of infinite regress and the baseless assumption of an intrinsic "stuff" behind reality.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Modern Science and Cosmology</b>: Leo criticizes modern science for its inability to address metaphysical questions and its metaphysical foundation is compared to ancient myths. The Big Bang theory and traditional notions of God suffer from the same issue of infinite regress without a satisfying explanation for the origins.
</li><li><b>Realization of the Phenomenal Field as Reality</b>: Empirical investigation indicates that reality is confined to the phenomenal field we experience. Concepts of reality beyond this personal experience exist as ideas within the phenomenal field but have no separate tangible existence.
</li><li><b>The Mind–Body Problem and Assumptions of Reality</b>: The unsolved philosophical mind–body problem stems from erroneous existential premises, presuming an objective reality 'behind' what is perceived. Challenging these assumptions, one might find that the so–called stuff behind the scenes is ultimately nothing. 
</li><li><b>Accepting Reality as Rendered Experience</b>: Leo suggests that recognizing reality as a rendering of the brain challenges deeply held beliefs. When individuals think about places not currently observed, they are often conceptualizing them as physical entities when in actuality, in those moments, they are nothing.
</li><li><b>Unpalatable truth of appearance</b>: The mind finds it difficult to accept that appearance has no origin beyond itself, clinging to the comfort of causal explanations rather than acknowledging the mystical nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Mechanistic worldview challenge</b>: People struggle with the idea that reality does not require a mechanism or cause, presenting an existential dilemma where the search for a fundamental mechanism becomes infinite and fruitless.
</li><li><b>Mystical nature of reality</b>: Leo highlights reality's inherent mysticism, unaffected by mechanistic explanations or physical underpinnings, a concept that both atheists and religious individuals often overlook or deny.
</li><li><b>Atheism and denial of mysticism</b>: Leo critiques typical atheists for rejecting the obvious mysticism of existence, preferring physical and mechanical explanations that fall short in explaining the true essence of reality.
</li><li><b>Direct empirical consciousness of reality</b>: According to Leo, it's possible to empirically understand the mystical nature of reality through experiences that evoke an 'OH MY GOD' moment, revealing reality's non–physical and magical characteristics.
</li><li><b>Undermining belief systems</b>: Leo encourages his audience to dismantle their beliefs and assumptions obstructing the recognition of reality's mystical nature, which can be an enlightening and beautiful experience.
</li><li><b>Quantum mechanics and naive realism</b>: Quantum mechanics has demonstrated problems with naive realism, dispelling notions of physicalism by replacing matter and energy with non–physical, infinite fields.
</li><li><b>Objections to realism and idealism</b>: Leo addresses potential objections regarding realism and idealism, advocating neither but instead urging proof of reality's mystical nature through self–proven experiences.
</li><li><b>Consequences of physicalism</b>: Believing in physicalism can limit one's values, priorities, and openness to non–ordinary phenomena, while acknowledging non–physical reality can radically change one's life perspective and stimulate personal and spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Existential undermining</b>: Challenging core assumptions about reality–like the nature of space, time, matter, and energy–is crucial for advanced personal and spiritual development, leading to profound open–mindedness and consciousness work.
</li><li><b>Phenomenal field as reality</b>: Leo asserts that reality is the phenomenal field itself; seeking what lies beneath is akin to asking for a physical basis when none is needed. Acceptance of this truth is transformative.
</li><li><b>Fundamental Truth and Surrender</b>: The essence of Leo's message is that accepting the true nature of reality is incredibly profound, requiring deep emotional surrender, not just intellectual understanding.
</li><li><b>Transformational Realization</b>: Recognizing reality as non–physical is life–altering, leading to a fundamental questioning of everything one believes about existence and prompting significant emotional upheaval.
</li><li><b>Challenging Illusions of Reality</b>: Leo advises questioning and dismantling the deep–seated belief that physical objects, boundaries, and substances are the basis of reality, as this view is an illusion and not scientifically proven.
</li><li><b>Science and Metaphysics</b>: He appreciates the practical aspects of science but criticizes the tendency to ignore metaphysics. Leo suggests that while science is best when pragmatic, it often wrongfully dismisses the value of metaphysical inquiry.
</li><li><b>Paradigm Shifting Strategy</b>: To shift one's reality paradigm, Leo recommends questioning the belief in physicalism rigorously and temporarily adopting opposing beliefs to loosen entrenched views.
</li><li><b>Awareness through Confusion</b>: The goal is to become open to the phenomenal field without filters, which can lead to a profound 'OH MY GOD' experience, transforming one's understanding of life, death, and existence.
</li><li><b>Avoiding New Ideologies</b>: Leo emphasizes that his insights should not be taken as an ideology but as a utilitarian tool for gaining higher consciousness and promoting personal growth.
</li><li><b>Self–inquiry and Personal Growth</b>: Leo highlights self–inquiry as crucial for enlightenment and self–actualization, and advises against getting too caught up in theories or entertainment aspects of his communications.
</li><li><b>Communications as Imperfect Metaphors</b>: He acknowledges the imperfect nature of communication and urges viewers to read between the lines for deeper meaning rather than taking his words literally.
</li><li><b>Engagement Beyond Enlightenment</b>: While enlightenment is crucial, Leo underscores the importance of self–mastery and personal development, encouraging viewers to engage with more profound topics and their own self–inquiry.
