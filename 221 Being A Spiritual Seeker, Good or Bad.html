        <ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about spiritual seeking</strong> : Leo discusses common misconceptions about being a spiritual seeker. Some people resist the identity due to stereotypes, while others, including the enlightened, often advise against seeking altogether, suggesting everything one seeks is already present or that enlightenment is simple and doesn't require effort. </li>
<li><strong>Pragmatism in spiritual seeking</strong> : Leo adopts a pragmatic view, stating that one must actively seek to become enlightened. He shares his recent rigorous workshop experience to demonstrate that enlightenment can be hard work, involving intense contemplation and sometimes physical toll. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual seeking as a hero's journey</strong> : He likens the spiritual journey to the hero's journey, its value lying in its circular nature. Leo argues that circular journeys are not pointless; they are essential for gaining new perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>The Alchemist as an illustration of spiritual seeking</strong> : Using "The Alchemist," Leo illustrates the circular journey in spirituality, where the protagonist's treasure was at home all along, signifying that the journey's lessons are the true rewards. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as part of Leo's journey</strong> : Reflecting on his four-year engagement with philosophy, Leo explains how he came full circle, realizing the limitations of philosophy and gaining a new perspective on truth beyond intellectual understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Individuality in the path to enlightenment</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the path to enlightenment is deeply personal, with each individual facing unique challenges and dead ends that ultimately contribute to growth and realization. </li>
<li><strong>Circularity of life</strong> : He discusses the circular pattern of life, from birth to death&mdash;starting as nothing and returning to nothing&mdash;and relates it to the natural cycles in the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Universality of the Hero's Journey</strong> : The story of Luke Skywalker from Star Wars is cited as an example of the hero's journey, where the process of growth, gaining insights, and overcoming obstacles is crucial and cannot be bypassed. </li>
<li><strong>Unique Paths to Enlightenment</strong> : Leo expresses that enlightenment paths are individualistic, with each person having their own set of problems, fears, and traumas to overcome. Enlightenment isn't about following a prescribed path by someone else; it is a personal journey that involves shedding one's own baggage and conquering inner demons through spiritual seeking. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Rules for Spiritual Seekers</strong> : Leo outlines three rules to guide spiritual seekers and prevent them from getting lost: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyclical Nature of the Journey</strong> : Recognize that seeking is a circular journey, leading back to where one started, emphasizing that enlightenment is an internal realization rather than a geographical or situational change. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Seek Techniques, Not Beliefs</strong> : He warns against dogmatism and suggests focusing on learning techniques to discover truth independently rather than adopting beliefs from external sources. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparing Spiritual Perspectives</strong> : He advises on the importance of studying a broad spectrum of spiritual traditions, comparing and contrasting to piece together a more complete understanding of spirituality and enlightenment, while avoiding dogmatic attachments to any single path. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enlightenment as an Independent Inner Journey</strong> : Leo drives home the point that enlightenment is an inner journey that cannot be found in books or through others' teachings, but must be discovered personally through techniques, not beliefs or dogmas. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Spiritual Teachers</strong> : He suggests a litmus test for good spiritual teachers is whether they provide techniques instead of preachings and deflect questions to encourage personal discovery, rather than providing ready-made answers. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Dogma through Diverse Perspectives</strong> : Mentioning the graves model from his previous work, Leo underscores the importance of being open to multiple perspectives, piecing together partial truths rather than subscribing to one absolute truth, aiming for richer and more complete enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Long-term Commitment to Understanding Life</strong> : Leo invites viewers to engage with his content regularly, promising that over time, this will lead to life-altering realizations, significant epiphanies, and possibly enlightenment. He emphasizes the practical application of psychological concepts for genuine life fulfillment, distinct from superficial success. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting a Satisfying Life through Learning</strong> : Leo states that by chipping away at understanding with his content, viewers will not only become self-help enthusiasts but also experience significant improvements in satisfaction and happiness in their lives, culminating in a meaningful enlightenment.</li>
