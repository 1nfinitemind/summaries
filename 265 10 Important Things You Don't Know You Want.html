            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/iwE4NhPv8aQ' target='_blank'>10 Important Things You Don't Know You Want</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Realization of Unconscious Desires</b>: Leo suggests that deep down individuals have desires they are not consciously aware of, which can lead to a profound lack of personal fulfillment and self–improvement misalignment due to pursuing misguided wants.
</li><li><b>Existential Magic Desired</b>: Individuals yearn to reclaim the childlike sense of wonder and magic they once experienced in perceiving every aspect of existence as fresh and enchanting, a quality typically eroded by societal conditioning and acclimatization.
</li><li><b>Yearning for Effortless Existence</b>: Leo describes a deep–seated desire for life to unfold naturally and effortlessly, without resistance, guilt, or strict adherence to rules, contrasting sharply with the typical friction–filled daily experiences of most individuals.
</li><li><b>Authenticity as a Core Desire</b>: There is a significant desire to behave spontaneously and uninhibitedly, being truly authentic in every situation, from personal relationships to professional ones, which often contrasts with current levels of inhibited and reserved living.
</li><li><b>Ideal of Uninhibited Spontaneity</b>: The aspiration to live uninhibitedly and without internal reservations can be likened to a playful form of intoxication with life itself, meriting effort to achieve such an authentic mode of existence on a daily basis.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Authenticity</b>: Leo explains the difficulty in distinguishing truly authentic behavior from neurotically driven attempts to appear authentic. He suggests that although the idea of genuine authenticity is appealing, most people are actually preoccupied with inauthentic desires, such as pursuing money or success, which obstruct the pursuit of what they genuinely want at a deeper level.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Overcoming Inauthentic Desires</b>: Leo asserts the importance of recognizing and overcoming inauthentic desires to uncover and strategize towards fulfilling authentic desires, warning that authentic desires are not typically at the forefront of one's mind.
</li><li><b>Craving a Dispassionate Mind</b>: Leo introduces the idea that what people truly want, but don't realize, is a dispassionate mind. This mind is detached and treats all experiences evenly, but it is not void of emotion드n economist or equanimous mind. It's a challenging concept because people generally seek passion and tend to resist the idea of dispassion.
</li><li><b>Detachment from Ideology</b>: He emphasizes the desire to be entirely unattached from any ideology or intellectual position, encouraging open–mindedness and highlighting the difficulty and resistance one might face when letting go of closely held beliefs or theories.
</li><li><b>True Sobriety and Lucidity</b>: Leo conveys that people yearn for total mental clarity and lucidity, akin to becoming aware in the midst of a dream, yet in waking life. He notes the struggle in achieving this heightened awareness due to the constant activity of the mind.
</li><li><b>Desire for Mental Silence</b>: He emphasizes the deep–seated desire for experiencing reality without the intrusion of thoughts, judgments, or theories드 silent mind, which he recognizes as difficult to achieve due to the incessant internal dialogue most people experience.
</li><li><b>Desire to be Nobody</b>: Leo discusses the counterintuitive longing to shed all aspects of one's personal identity, history, and societal labels, aiming to return to the 'blank slate' state of being a nobody, reminiscent of early childhood before identities solidify, challenging the common view that self–development is about enhancing one's identity.
</li><li><b>Understanding Samadhi</b>: He touches on the concept of Samadhi, describing it as an experience where there's a unity between the observer and the observed, and how achieving this state is deeply fulfilling but not well known or pursued by most due to lack of awareness.
</li><li><b>Samadhi Experience</b>: Samadhi is a state of consciousness where one becomes one with the object of observation, experiencing no division between observer and observed. It's a direct experience that transcends intellectual understanding or ideology, feeling natural and complete. With practice and meditation, varying degrees and intensities of Samadhi can be achieved, each bringing an intense sense of fulfillment, surpassing common joys like orgasms or social events. 
</li><li><b>Desire for Ultimate Truth</b>: Leo speaks of an inherent, yet unrecognized, desire for truth (with a capital 'T'), which differs from beliefs or ideologies. It is absolute truth, discovered personally and independent of any conditions. Recognizing this truth can supersede all false desires, but it requires an openness and commitment to seeking it without precondition.
</li><li><b>Being a Benevolent Force</b>: Beyond the superficial wants, there's a deep desire to contribute positively to the world. This contribution is highly individualistic and relates to one's life purpose, whether through art, teaching, medicine, or other expressions of giving. It's about transforming from focus on self to emphasis on being an outpouring force of generosity and love.
</li><li><b>Shift from Taking to Giving</b>: Shifting life's focus from self–gain to selfless giving is a fundamental but often overlooked desire. Most people are caught up in acquiring status, material wealth, and personal achievements, unaware that true fulfillment lies in the act of giving and positively impacting others' lives.
</li><li><b>Desire for a Simple, Natural Lifestyle</b>: There's a yearning for a simplified, uncluttered lifestyle that reconnects with nature and reduces dependence on modern technology and culture. Simplifying life by removing unnecessary distractions can lead to healthier living, a relaxed schedule, and a deeper appreciation for life's basic joys.
</li><li><b>Appeal of Simplicity</b>: Leo underscores the beauty of a simple life, comparing it to being alone on a deserted island where existence is reduced to its bare essentials: eating, washing, and finding joy in the mundane like sunsets or the scent of flowers. He reminds us that, when reality regains its magic, even a seemingly dull life is full of wonder.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Hedonistic Pursuits</b>: Leo criticizes the pursuit of hedonism듨aximizing pleasure드s counterproductive. He clarifies that true fulfillment isn't found in chasing pleasure, which is often mistakenly believed to be the ultimate goal.
</li><li><b>Irrelevance of Superficial Desires</b>: He points out that many common desires듨oney, sex, relationships, good looks, success, and even self–actualization드re not what we truly want. Leo argues these are distractions from the deeper, more meaningful desires he has listed.
</li><li><b>Tragedy of Not Realizing Being Lost</b>: Leo suggests that many people are unaware of how lost they are in the pursuit of misguided goals, enveloped in layers of denial and delusion that prevent genuine self–development.
</li><li><b>True Self–Development and Shattering Illusions</b>: Leo's approach to aiding in self–improvement is unconventional; rather than enabling delusions, he aims to help individuals realize their goals may be immature and misguided, leading them away from real growth.
</li><li><b>Societal Blindspots</b>: He observes that society rarely challenges individuals on their life path, allowing them to continue in potentially wrong directions without questioning if it's truly right for them.
</li><li><b>Personal Predictability and Common Mistakes</b>: Leo emphasizes everyone makes similar life mistakes, running "predictable software" which leads to recurring problems, and how understanding this helps him recognize these patterns in others as well as himself.
</li><li><b>Fear and Resistance to True Desires</b>: He notes a paradox where people are often frightened of realizing their true desires, and it could take years to overcome the resistance to accepting and striving for what they truly want.
</li><li><b>Potential Futility of Avoiding Wasted Life</b>: Leo ponders whether, despite offering the wisdom of ages from various teachings, some may be too deeply set in their ways to change, leading to wasted decades of life due to stubborn resistance.
</li><li><b>Staying on Track with Self–Development</b>: He closes by inviting viewers to sign up for his newsletter as a way to stay consistent with their self–actualization goals, emphasizing the risk of veering off path and the potential to waste years of life without continual focus on personal growth.
