            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yAmb4H0PRAs' target='_blank'>The Importance Of Real Yoga</a></h1>
            <p><em>"The restraint of the modification of mind-stuff is Yoga." - Patanjali</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real Yoga versus Western Yoga</strong> : Real yoga is an ancient Indian spiritual practice aiming for enlightenment, unlike the Western version which is focused on physical flexibility and relaxation. The term 'yoga' itself means 'union', denoting the unity of subject and object into one non-dual reality. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of Yoga</strong> : Majority of Westerners practicing hatha yoga at gyms are unaware that it's a heavily modified form of actual yoga, which is not mainly about physical exercise but meditation and awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as Yoga's True Aim</strong> : The primary objective of yoga is to still the mind profoundly, enabling the practitioner to merge into union with the absolute, leading to awakening or liberation (moksha). </li>
<li><strong>Yoga as a Research Field for Leo Gura</strong> : Leo experiments with various spiritual techniques, urging open-mindedness in exploring practices like yoga when traditional meditation or self-inquiry lacks results. </li>
<li><strong>Purification through Yoga</strong> : Real yoga aims to purify the body and mind, clearing chakras or energy centers along the spine, releasing tension and blockages, promoting energy flow, and potentially alleviating health conditions. It also offers the possibility of developing spiritual abilities known as cities. </li>
<li><strong>The Commercialization of Yoga in the West</strong> : Western yoga often excludes the metaphysical and consciousness awakening elements of traditional yoga, focusing more on physical wellness, community, and marketability. </li>
<li><strong>Diverse Schools of Real Yoga</strong> : There are numerous branches of real yoga, such as Ashtanga or Raja Yoga, Gyana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, each with different methods for achieving the union of non-duality. These schools can have conflicting views, even on fundamental aspects such as the number of chakras. </li>
<li><strong>Bhakti Yoga</strong> : Bhakti Yoga involves a high level of devotion to a deity, aligning with the idea of surrendering oneself entirely to merge with the deity, ultimately attaining union through devotion. This path demands a degree of devotion uncommon in Western culture, making it less effective for many in the West. </li>
<li><strong>Karma Yoga</strong> : Karma Yoga is the yoga of action, where one dedicates themselves entirely to their life purpose or to selfless service to others. It's a form of spiritual practice that leads to union through surrender to action and service. However, achieving enlightenment solely through Karma Yoga is considered rare and indirect. </li>
<li><strong>Different Branches of Yoga</strong> : Various forms of yoga exist, like Kundalini Yoga, Kriya Yoga (promoted by Paramahansa Yogananda), Tantra, and Shaivism. Tantra often misunderstood in the Western context; it's not about sex but involves elaborate visualization techniques for union with the absolute. These branches and their sub-schools frequently disagree with each other, reflecting the common bickering found within spiritual traditions. </li>
<li><strong>Yoga's Holistic Approach</strong> : Leo argues that yoga is superior to meditation and self-inquiry as it clears chakras, purges emotional trauma, offers holistic awakening including mind and body, and can improve physical health, making it more potent and requiring less time. </li>
<li><strong>Yoga and Breathwork</strong> : Yoga teaches correct methods of breathing, which are essential for physical vitality and mental focus. It transforms shallow chest breathing into deep belly breathing, leading to stiller and more concentrated mind states necessary for mystical experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectualization and Self-Inquiry</strong> : Yoga can help overcome the pitfall of intellectualization common in self-inquiry, thereby avoiding stagnation and enabling real progress on the path to awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Starting Yoga and Role of Gurus</strong> : Queries about starting yoga often include the need for a guru and the elusive quest to find a suitable one. Traditional yoga schools necessitate a guru-student relationship involving initiation and gradual technique sharing, but this can lead to concerns about trust, accessibility, and unwanted dogmatic teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Westernized Kriya Yoga Approach</strong> : Leo promotes a Westernized approach to Kriya Yoga that doesn't rely on an organization or guru. This method is direct and powerful, with Lahiri being the master of the most authentic techniques. It allows for independent practice, aligning with the original intention of Kriya Yoga. </li>
<li><strong>Yogananda and Kriya Yoga</strong> : While recognizing the contributions of Yogananda to popularizing Kriya Yoga, Leo critiques the Self-Realization Fellowship for offering teachings that may be corrupt and diluted. Instead, he recommends learning Kriya Yoga as initially taught by Lahiri for a more genuine experience. </li>
<li><strong>Lahiri's Kriya Yoga and Accessibility</strong> : Yogananda's teachings were already somewhat diluted; having access to the original Lahiri's Kriya Yoga techniques would provide a more authentic experience. Fortunately, a book has been found that details all of Lahiri's techniques, including worksheets and an exercise plan to develop a Kriya yoga practice from beginner to advanced levels, which Leo has added to his book list for anyone interested. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Committing to Kriya Yoga</strong> : By practicing Kriya Yoga daily for 30-60 minutes over the course of a year, one can expect a quieter mind, transformed breathing, an enhanced sense of bodily awareness&mdash;particularly of the spine, improved health, and potentially even experiencing Samadhi states and progressive chakra opening. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Skepticism and Yoga</strong> : Leo addresses skepticism around Yoga, suggesting that traditional materialistic science fails to capture its metaphysical aspects. He argues that while yoga does not fit into typical Western scientific paradigms, it is a legitimate science of consciousness with profound, experimentally accessible benefits. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Experiment with Yoga</strong> : Leo encourages skeptics to approach yoga with scientific rigor by conducting personal experiments. He suggests that by engaging with yoga practice sufficiently, critics may find that the results starkly contrast their expectations, surpassing what is commonly dismissed as placebo effects. </li>
<li><strong>Utility of Yogic Models</strong> : Leo advises against viewing concepts like chakras and the subtle body through a strictly materialistic lens, instead recommending seeing them as pragmatic models for personal development. He emphasizes that what matters are the transformative results these practices can yield. </li>
<li><strong>Potential Profound Impacts of Yoga</strong> : Engaging deeply with yoga can lead to intense emotional purging and experiences that may become overwhelming, similar to the confrontation of deep-seated issues in psychotherapy. This intensity signals both effectiveness and areas that require healing. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation through Yoga</strong> : Traditional yoga practices incite deep emotional release and transformation more powerfully than talk therapy, as it facilitates physical and mental development through consistent practice over time. </li>
<li><strong>Reconsidering the Need for a Guru</strong> : Leo questions the necessity of a guru for practicing yoga, pointing out the practical challenges of finding a genuine guru, the risk of dogmatism, and the drawbacks of following a corrupt or dogmatic school. </li>
<li><strong>Do-It-Yourself Yoga</strong> : He advocates a self-reliant approach to spiritual practice, particularly with Kriya Yoga, which was originally taught as a solo practice where the universe serves as the Guru. This approach emphasizes the importance of personal commitment to practicing the prescribed techniques. </li>
<li><strong>Kriya Yoga as Open Source</strong> : Leo emphasizes the accessibility and cost-free nature of Kriya Yoga, which can be learned from books without the need for a guru, ashram, or community, thus avoiding distraction and dogma. </li>
<li><strong>Synthesizing Multiple Techniques</strong> : Kriya Yoga is powerful, but Leo advises not to rely solely on it. He recommends combining it with self-inquiry, meditation, psychedelics, theory studying, and diverse personal development techniques to calibrate an individualized path. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Western Yoga</strong> : He cautions that Western gym-style yoga has its benefits, but it falls dramatically short of the spiritual potential offered by traditional yoga. He suggests augmenting it with Kriya Yoga or switching to it entirely for spiritual awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals of Yoga</strong> : Leo defines three primary aims of yoga: achieving permanent union (sahaja Samadhi), realizing one's true infinite nature, and purifying all karma and ego. He stresses the importance of understanding these goals to navigate the self-help journey effectively. </li>
<li><strong>Utilizing Theory from Books</strong> : He underscores the immense value found in books, suggesting that his book list contains all the foundational wisdom necessary for life mastery, encouraging repeated reading and application of the knowledge shared. </li>
<li><strong>Committing to Personal Transformation</strong> : Leo encourages taking the insights seriously and beginning the practices immediately to experience profound life changes over the years. </li>
<li><strong>Future Sharing of Effective Techniques</strong> : Leo concludes by reiterating his commitment to researching and sharing the most potent techniques for personal development across various life aspects. He underscores the importance of leveraging techniques for their practical benefits rather than their theoretical appeal.</li>
