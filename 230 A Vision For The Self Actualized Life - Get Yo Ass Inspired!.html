</li><li><b>Contrast Between Regular and Self–Actualized Life</b>: Leo differentiates ordinary life from a self–actualized one, highlighting that self–actualization allows one to live at the peak of human capability, a concept most people don't understand due to average, neurotic, and dysfunctional environments that don't encourage reaching one's potential.
