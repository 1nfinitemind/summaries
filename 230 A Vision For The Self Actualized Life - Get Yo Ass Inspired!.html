<li><strong>Contrast Between Regular and Self-Actualized Life</strong> : Leo differentiates ordinary life from a self-actualized one, highlighting that self-actualization allows one to live at the peak of human capability, a concept most people don't understand due to average, neurotic, and dysfunctional environments that don't encourage reaching one's potential. </li>
