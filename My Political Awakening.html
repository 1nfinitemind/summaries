            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/my-political-awakening' target='_blank'>My Political Awakening</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Principle of life's inherent goodness</b>: Leo discusses a profound principle that whatever happens in life–no matter how tragic or challenging–is good. This perspective is difficult to accept by the ego, as it requires a holistic view of reality where every incident is part of a larger intelligent sequence leading towards an absolute good.
</li><li><b>Non–linear nature of growth and progress</b>: Leo emphasizes that life doesn't progress in a straight line, but rather through a dialectic process of ups and downs. He illustrates with personal examples how setbacks may seem destructive but can ultimately contribute to the greater good by reshaping one's path or contributing to collective evolution.
</li><li><b>Political engagement and awakening</b>: Discussing his own political awakening, Leo recounts his initial political naivety and evolution of his understanding, prompted by successive presidencies and particularly by Trump's election. He reflects on the need for a deeper, informed engagement with politics, beyond mere voting, exploring new information sources and recognizing the complex dynamism of societal growth.
</li><li><b>Impact of Trump's presidency and cultural shifts</b>: Leo sees Trump's presidency as a disruptive but necessary phenomenon that exposes systemic flaws within the American political system and sparks an awakening to its corruption and limitations. This period is viewed as a catalyst for broader societal development and increased political sophistication within the populace.
</li><li><b>Importance of self–awareness in political activism</b>: Throughout the discussion, Leo highlights the importance of personal spiritual development and self–awareness when engaging in political activism. He alludes to the potential of finding a life purpose within the realm of societal improvement but cautions against foregoing personal development in pursuit of external change.
</li><li><b>Political and societal evolution</b>: The current political system and many modern politicians lack the consciousness and visionary qualities necessary to guide society effectively. Thriving societies require leaders to think beyond short–term gains and into the long–term future, addressing systemic issues for transformational change. This means avoiding the trap of narrow partisan ideology, whether from the right or the left.
</li><li><b>Trump's presidency as a catalyst</b>: Despite initial perceptions of negativity, Trump's presidency is seen as a necessary event to bring systemic flaws to light. This presidency highlights the weaknesses of both the Republican and Democratic parties and serves to teach society through the exposure of the extreme materialistic values and corruption within the political system.
</li><li><b>Overcoming societal addictions</b>: Societal progression often involves confronting and overcoming collective toxic behaviors and addictions, such as rampant capitalism, in a manner similar to personal growth. This necessitates a deep acknowledgment of the dysfunctionality within these behaviors, leading to a conscious decision to change and evolve.
</li><li><b>America's complacency and systemic correction</b>: America's historical success has led to complacency and an aversion to critically examining the capitalist system that has dominated for the past century. Leo suggests that the country has reached a peak of prosperity and is now facing necessary downturns, inviting systemic introspection and reform.
</li><li><b>Purifying effect of Trump's term</b>: Despite the real harm inflicted during Trump's presidency, it is believed that in the long run, his term will act as a catalyst for purification–leading to a resurgence in progressivism and liberalism, driven by the collective awakening to political corruption and outdated systems.
</li><li><b>Reflection on America's political system</b>: The American political system is currently seen as deeply corrupt, with parallels drawn to the normalization of slavery in the past. There's a call for substantial changes such as the banning of all lobbying and corporate PAC money, stricter laws on campaign financing, and constitutional changes to strengthen democratic institutions.
</li><li><b>Understanding conservatism and systemic issues</b>: Conservatism is critiqued for preserving the status quo and resisting systemic evolution. Leo does not align strictly with traditional party ideologies but calls for understanding and addressing the deeper structural issues within politics from a non–partisan and systemic perspective.
</li><li><b>Intertwining of church and state</b>: The mingling of church and state leads to each using the other to justify selfish acts and limit diversity, countering the essential democratic principles of freedom and separation emphasized in the US Constitution. The separation of church and state is a sophisticated democratic concept not yet fully understood or implemented in society, even though it is crucial to preserve the integrity of governance and protect genuine spirituality.
</li><li><b>Counterintuitive growth through political engagement</b>: Political engagement, previously seen as a distraction, can contribute to growth and development, challenging individuals to expand beyond personal spiritual work to develop a sophisticated understanding of politics and governance. This broader engagement is necessary for creating a more intelligent and conscious society capable of evolving beyond current political limitations and improving collective governance based on systemic thinking.
</li><li><b>Cultural shifts as catalysts for societal evolution</b>: Societal evolution and progress arise from culture shifts that challenge established norms and encourage systemic thinking, evidenced by changing attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights. These shifts, though resisted historically, demonstrate humanity's capacity to transcend outdated beliefs and practices. Leo predicts that future societies will view current practices, such as billionaire–funded political campaigns, as egregious and anti–democratic due to their incompatibility with truly democratic ideals.
</li><li><b>Developmental stages and democratic capacity</b>: Democracy's effectiveness is contingent on the populace's developmental stage, as observed in various regions of the Middle East, where it struggles due to insufficient societal development. Analogously, America's crude form of democracy requires further maturation, moving from allowing few to vote to broader inclusivity and accessibility, demonstrating democracy's evolution and the need for ongoing societal development.
</li><li><b>Evolution of voting rights and democracy's maturity</b>: The expansion of voting rights over time reflects the maturation of democracy, from restrictive voting rights to more inclusive elections and improved access. However, even contemporary American democracy shows weaknesses and deficiencies, underscored by Leo's political awakening, triggered by Trump's presidency, which highlighted the significance of active civic engagement and informed political participation as catalysts for societal advancement.
</li><li><b>Societal change and dogmatic resistance</b>: Society's evolution is slow, often taking generations before old dogmas give way to new norms. Historical perspective shows that the growth of humanity and society is a continuous process of shedding selfishness. Leo notes that progress is often resisted, citing the near–obsolete monarchy system as an example of how society becomes too conscious to accept certain forms of blatant selfishness.
</li><li><b>Philosopher Georg Hegel's contribution</b>: Hegel's philosophy on the evolution of society and culture as part of infinity evolving is mentioned, indicating his enlightened understanding of the absolute and infinity. Hegel's concepts, though underappreciated today, provide insight into the dialectical and non–dualistic process of societal progress.
</li><li><b>Personal perspective and collective evolution</b>: Leo acknowledges that it's challenging for individuals facing discrimination or hardship to see the 'greater good' in their struggles. However, they emphasize that from a broader perspective, all experiences, including suffering, contribute to collective spiritual growth and the larger evolution of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Principle of life's inherent goodness</b>: Leo reiterates that everything in life, regardless of personal perception, serves a greater good. The ability to see this depends on deep awakening, which involves transcending the ego. This awakening leads to realizing the infinite intelligence and goodness in the universe's design, fundamentally altering one's relationship with life.
</li><li><b>Facing one's greatest fear, death</b>: Psychedelics are likened to induced near–death experiences that provide opportunities for significant spiritual realization and growth. This confrontation with death allows individuals to overcome their deepest fears, recognize the non–existence of death, and thus live more peacefully.
</li><li><b>Holistic perspective and everyday morality</b>: Leo encourages the adoption of a holistic view of reality, recognizing the interconnectedness of all events and their contribution to the ultimate good. This perspective shifts understanding from a limited personal viewpoint to an appreciation of the universe's intricate and intelligent design.
</li><li><b>Tolerance through recognition of universal goodness</b>: Embracing a perspective that perceives all aspects of life as fundamentally good can deepen one's spiritual consciousness, improve personal happiness, honesty, and reduce manipulative behaviors. It also involves acknowledging one's egoic reactions as natural but ultimately unfounded resistances to this perspective.
</li><li><b>Sophisticated approach to politics</b>: To contribute meaningfully to society and work towards conditions such as universal health care, it's essential to educate oneself about the complexities of government and politics. This includes understanding the influences of authoritarianism, democracy, and economic systems beyond superficial media portrayals, and reckoning with the long–term evolution of humanity and the cosmos.
</li><li><b>Engaged citizenship and political awakening</b>: An informed and involved citizenry is vital for bringing about change, such as civil rights advancements and the abolition of political corruption. Organizations like Wolf–PAC work towards significant reforms like removing money from politics. Active political participation should not replace personal spiritual work but complement it, integrating enlightenment with social improvement efforts.
</li><li><b>Harmonizing inner awakening with societal engagement</b>: While inner spiritual awakening should remain the primary focus, one's life purpose and efforts to enhance society should also receive attention. Conscious engagement without compromising personal development creates a balanced approach to enacting change and finding fulfillment in contributing to the greater good of the world.
