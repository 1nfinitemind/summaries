<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KYHfZM2Q/503-How-To-Detox-Heavy-Metals-Lead-Mercury-DEMO-Image-7.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process of collecting urine for testing</strong> : Leo illustrates the six-hour process for collecting a urine sample for heavy metal testing wherein all urine is mixed in a container, poured into a sample vial, and sent to the lab with paperwork using provided shipping materials. </li>
<li><strong>DMSA requirements for testing</strong> : The test kit does not include DMSA, a chelating agent required for the provoked urine test; Leo suggests purchasing it separately and discusses proper dosage guidelines. </li>
<li><strong>Conducting baseline and provoked tests</strong> : Before starting detox protocols, Leo recommends taking two urine tests: a baseline unprovoked test and a second provoked test with DMSA to establish levels of heavy metal excretion. </li>
<li><strong>Dosage of DMSA</strong> : For a provoked urine test, Leo advises a DMSA dosage of 30 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, ensuring individual dosage adjustments. </li>
<li><strong>Risks associated with provoked testing</strong> : Caution is advised when performing provoked tests due to the risks associated with releasing high levels of stored heavy metals, particularly in individuals with metal fillings or ongoing heavy metal exposure. </li>
<li><strong>Interpreting test results</strong> : Test results reflect toxins excreted within a three-hour window post-DMSA ingestion; multiple chelation rounds and subsequent testing are required to infer toxin levels stored in organs. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nrvGYSQw/503-How-To-Detox-Heavy-Metals-Lead-Mercury-DEMO-Image-8.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government safety standards questioned</strong> : Leo expresses skepticism about FDA and EPA heavy metal safety levels, suspecting inadequate regulatory enforcement and industry influence. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation steps and thoroughness</strong> : Leo emphasizes rounds of chelation and retesting as necessary steps to ensure toxic metals are being effectively removed and overall performance is not being compromised. </li>
<li><strong>No safe levels of heavy metals</strong> : Any amount of heavy metals in the body can negatively impact health and mood. Detox can potentially alleviate chronic mood issues, though individual results may vary. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation protocol scheduling</strong> : Leo describes the three to four-day chelation process, with dosing intervals based on the half-lives of chelation substances like DMSA and ALA to prevent inadvertent toxin redistribution. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation Therapy Schedule</strong> : Leo explains the ideal schedule for chelation therapy, recommending a 3 to 4 day period of taking chelation pills followed by another 3 to 4 days off for bodily recovery due to potential side effects and stress on the body. </li>
<li><strong>Duration and Frequency of Chelation Rounds</strong> : A single chelation round consists of the aforementioned pill-taking period plus the rest period. The total number of chelation rounds needed depends on individual toxicity levels; Leo aims for 50-60 rounds over several years for optimal health. </li>
<li><strong>Preparation for Consistent Chelation</strong> : To maintain consistency, Leo advises pre-sorting all pills and doses into labeled pillboxes prior to starting. This approach simplifies the process and ensures doses are not skipped. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Using Timers for Dosing</strong> : Timers with alarms are recommended to prevent forgetting doses, especially during the night, which is critical for maintaining the dosing schedule. </li>
<li><strong>Support Supplements in Chelation Protocol</strong> : In addition to chelating agents (DMSA and alpha lipoic acid), Leo takes support supplements such as buffered Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc Picolinate, and Magnesium Citrate to aid the detox process and minimize symptoms. </li>
<li><strong>Supplements to Avoid During Chelation</strong> : Leo warns against using certain natural supplements and chelators such as chlorella, spirulina, cilantro, NAC, Glutathione, IV treatments, and daily alpha lipoic acid, as they may redistribute heavy metals unpredictably when not part of a structured protocol like the one Leo recommends. </li>
<li><strong>Dosage Recommendations for Chelation Agents</strong> : Leo provides detailed dosage instructions for DMSA, alpha lipoic acid, and DMPS, stressing the importance of considering body weight and toxicity levels. A gradual, cautious approach is advised to avoid severe side effects. </li>
<li><strong>Packaging Supplements into Pillboxes for Demo</strong> : Leo demonstrates the process of sorting and organizing chelation supplements into pillboxes for each three-hour dosing period. This includes the main chelating agents as well as the supporting vitamins, emphasizing careful planning and prepping in advance for the chelation to be manageable. </li>
<li><strong>Initial Rounds and Dosage Adjustments</strong> : Suggesting that users start with a lower dosage of alpha lipoic acid due to its strong effects, especially on brain detox, Leo advises incrementally increasing the dosage across rounds if there are no severe side effects, focusing on patience and steady progress. </li>
<li><strong>Expectation of detox experience variability</strong> : Detox rounds can result in varying experiences; some can leave an individual feeling great while others can cause discomfort. This fluctuation is normal and is part of the detox process. </li>
<li><strong>Need for a high-quality digital timer</strong> : Using a digital timer is crucial to maintain a strict three-hour schedule for supplement intake, including overnight. This ensures consistent dosing, which is key to the detox process. </li>
<li><strong>Managing detox side effects</strong> : If severe side effects occur, it suggests the dosage is too high. Dosages of DMSA, DMPS, or alpha lipoic acid should be adjusted to mitigate effects while still allowing daily activities. </li>
<li><strong>Organizing supplements with pillboxes</strong> : An organized system with pillboxes and timers is vital for consistency in taking supplements. Proper organization prevents the protocol from falling apart due to missed doses. </li>
<li><strong>Safety of chelating agents (DMSA, ALA, DMPS)</strong> : DMSA, ALA, and DMPS are backed by science for safety and effectiveness in chelation for both adults and children, but the heavy metals mobilized by these agents are hazardous and require careful detox protocol adherence. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of traditional doctor support for detox protocols</strong> : Many doctors may not be familiar with or may even discourage these detox protocols due to lack of research in the standard medical community; self-study is often necessary for personal health optimization. </li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty in the number of chelation rounds</strong> : The total rounds of detox required can vary greatly from person to person, depending on individual toxicity levels. Begin with 10 rounds, observe improvements, and retest using urine tests to monitor progress. </li>
<li><strong>Potential side effects during detox</strong> : Side effects can include fatigue, depression, sleep disturbances, or mood changes. Proper dosage management can mitigate these effects, ensuring they are bearable and do not disrupt daily life. </li>
<li><strong>Pros and cons of various chelating chemicals</strong> : Each chelating agent&mdash;DMSA, DMPS, ALA&mdash;has affinities to specific heavy metals. DMSA is better for lead, DMPS for mercury, and ALA for crossing the blood-brain barrier to remove metals from the brain. </li>
<li><strong>Combining chelation chemicals</strong> : Personalized combination of chelating agents can be tailored based on individual metal toxicity. Start with DMSA or DMPS and consider adding ALA after initial rounds to detox the brain. </li>
<li><strong>Natural methods versus chemical chelation</strong> : Despite the appeal of natural detox methods like cilantro, the chemical chelation approach using DMSA, DMPS, and ALA is presented as the more scientifically reliable protocol for heavy metal detoxification. </li>
<li><strong>Natural vs. Chemical Chelation</strong> : Leo advocates for the use of proven chemical chelators (DMSA, DMPS, ALA) over natural methods like cilantro, chlorella, and spirulina, as there isn't strong evidence for the efficacy of natural methods and they may redistribute heavy metals in the body without effectively eliminating them. </li>
<li><strong>Blood-Brain Barrier in Detox</strong> : Chemical chelators like alpha-lipoic acid are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and effectively detoxing the brain, unlike natural methods such as cilantro, charcoal, or celery juice. </li>
<li><strong>Evidence for Chelation Efficacy</strong> : Leo recommends looking up scientific research on PubMed or Google for terms like "DMSA mercury and lead detox" to validate the effectiveness and safety of chemical chelators for heavy metal detox. </li>
<li><strong>Criteria for Chelation</strong> : Individuals with chronic health issues such as fatigue, cognitive problems, ADD, or anxiety, and those with past heavy metal exposure or metal fillings, should consider chelation therapy, especially if they have not found relief through other treatments. </li>
<li><strong>Proof of Chelation Benefit</strong> : The ultimate test for the effectiveness of the chelation protocol is personal experience. If symptoms improve after several rounds of detox, it suggests the protocol is working. </li>
<li><strong>Health Factors Beyond Heavy Metals</strong> : There are numerous environmental and dietary toxins beyond heavy metals, such as pesticides and plastics, which also impact health and may require additional or different treatment protocols. </li>
<li><strong>Personalized Approach to Health</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of a customized approach to solving health issues, acknowledging the role of diet, exercise, genetics, environment, lifestyle, and spirituality in overall health. </li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures for Heavy Metals</strong> : Leo suggests drinking reverse osmosis water, avoiding seafood and organ meats, and being cautious with supplements and protein powders to minimize re-toxification and accumulation of heavy metals. </li>
<li><strong>Hidden Sources of Heavy Metal Exposure</strong> : Beware of heavy metal contamination in powders, spices, baby food, and organ meats, as well as indirect exposure from the environment, including construction sites and highways. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation Cost</strong> : The financial investment in chelation therapy includes the cost of supplements, urine tests, and educational resources, with ongoing maintenance rounds recommended to manage accumulation from daily exposure. </li>
<li><strong>Heavy Metal Contamination in Common Products</strong> : Even organic and natural products can contain high levels of heavy metals, including organic spices like oregano and thyme. Makeup can also have lead and mercury. Consumers are warned to not assume a product is safe just because it's organic or from a health food store. </li>
<li><strong>Risks of Home Improvement Chemicals and Proximity to Highways</strong> : Exposure to toxic chemicals from paint, solvents, and household work can contribute to health problems. Living near major highways can increase cancer risk due to pollution. </li>
<li><strong>Lead Exposure at Shooting Ranges</strong> : Shooting with lead ammunition releases vaporized lead particles into the air, posing a health risk. Use of lead-free ammo and visiting lead-free shooting ranges are recommended. </li>
<li><strong>Fluorescent Lighting Dangers</strong> : Fluorescent lights contain toxic materials and should be replaced by LED lights to reduce the risk of heavy metal exposure. </li>
<li><strong>Cost of Chelation Therapy</strong> : The total estimated cost of 15-20 rounds of chelation therapy, including the necessary supplements and urine tests, is around $1000. The investment is considered worth it due to potential health benefits and prevention of serious illnesses. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation Therapy for Children with Autism</strong> : While heavy metal detox is not guaranteed to cure Autism, there are reports of children showing significant improvement. Proper dosages adjusted for weight can make chelation safe for children. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Environmental Toxins on Health Epidemics</strong> : The rise in ADD, Autism, and other health issues might be partially attributed to environmental toxins and poor food industry practices. </li>
<li><strong>Resilience and Recovery Potential of the Body</strong> : Leo reflects on the body's remarkable ability to recover from the damage caused by environmental toxins and stresses the importance of reforming lifestyles to prevent further harm. </li>
<li><strong>Procuring Chelation Supplements</strong> : DMSA and DMPS can be purchased without a prescription from overseas sources like Canada, South Africa, or the UK, while alpha lipoic acid is widely available in supplement stores. </li>
<li><strong>Closing Remarks on Chelation Therapy</strong> : Heavy metal detox should be approached with serious research, commitment, and viewed as one part of a broader health management strategy. Proper implementation requires understanding and consistency. </li>
<li><strong>Chelation Commitment and Vision</strong> : To realize the full benefits of chelation, one must pursue a long-term vision, viewing it as an investment in time, finances, and emotional labor. </li>
<li><strong>Remembering to maintain chelation</strong> : Leo acknowledges that life's busyness can lead to forgetting to maintain chelation schedules, especially when not wanting to wake up at night for pill intake. </li>
<li><strong>Interpreting negative side effects</strong> : Negative side effects from chelation should be seen as signs of effective detox, encouraging continuation with adjusted dosages if severe effects occur. </li>
<li><strong>Severe side effects caution</strong> : A cautionary tale is shared where a person suffered severe consequences from an accidental, unusually high dose of alpha-lipoic acid, resulting in suicide. </li>
<li><strong>Traditional doctor skepticism</strong> : Leo describes his experience with doctors who dismissed heavy metal toxicity and attributes his health improvements to chelation rather than their advice. </li>
<li><strong>Non-medical advice disclaimer</strong> : Leo clarifies that his insights are not medical advice and encourages listeners to use their judgment and research in managing their health. </li>
<li><strong>Connection between toxicity and self-actualization</strong> : Underlying health issues such as toxicity can hinder self-actualization and spiritual progress. Clearing brain fog through chelation has increased mental clarity and enhanced psychedelic experiences for Leo. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of 'clean' brain for spirituality</strong> : Leo suggests that spiritual growth requires a non-toxic brain, a factor often overlooked by spiritual teachers. </li>
<li><strong>Personal health responsibility</strong> : Viewers are encouraged to take responsibility for their health as it forms the foundation for self-actualization and spiritual practices.</li>
