        <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/changing-perspectives-destroys-reality' target='_blank'>Changing Perspectives Destroys Reality</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Experience of reality's subjectivity</strong> : Leo describes a profound personal experience where he perceived reality as entirely subjective, realizing that what is considered real is just a perspective-nothing more than a collective fiction, an illusion that doesn't inherently matter whether acknowledged or not.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulties in conveying perspective relativity</strong> : Leo discusses the challenge in communicating the concept that reality is a subjective perspective to others who view their reality as concrete and tangible, highlighting a fundamental disconnect in understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Clinging to perspectives</strong> : Leo emphasizes that minds tend to cling to their current perspectives and actively resist considering others, which he believes is due to the underlying relativity of reality; exploring too many diverse perspectives can cause one's stable sense of reality to dissolve.</li>
<li><strong>Skeptical philosophy and search for truth</strong> : Leo reflects on his high school years when he embraced skepticism and committed to seeking truth without being swayed by religious or scientific dogmas, illustrating his long-standing quest for understanding diverse perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Concept of trying multiple worldviews</strong> : Leo presents the idea of adopting different religious and philosophical worldviews on a rotating basis as a method to deepen his search for truth, acknowledging the epistemological challenge of determining which authority to trust amid conflicting claims.</li>
<li><strong>The game of perspectives and reality construction</strong> : Leo explains that the mind constructs reality by playing a game of perspective management, insisting that exploring a breadth of perspectives can cause an experiential realization that undermines the illusion of a stable reality.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge of radical perspective shifting</strong> : He notes the nearly impossible task of asking someone deeply rooted in one perspective to genuinely adopt another for a short time, pointing to a covert understanding within the mind of each person that such an endeavor could irrevocably alter their worldview.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to perspective change</strong> : People resist changing perspectives due to the fear of losing their perceived reality. This resistance stems from the belief in an objective reality that underlies various worldviews, even when subscribing to different religious or scientific beliefs, such as Christianity or atheism.</li>
<li><strong>Materialist vs. realist paradigms</strong> : There are two thought paradigms: the materialist paradigm assumes an objective reality behind varied perspectives, while the realist paradigm, which Leo advocates, posits that reality is solely the perspective itself, dismissing the existence of an objective reality behind it.</li>
<li><strong>Ego and the fear of change</strong> : Switching from one firmly held perspective to another threatens the stability that the ego depends on for its identity, effectively changing one's reality and self. The fear of such change prevents people from deeply exploring other worldviews.</li>
<li><strong>Clinging to perspectives and reality</strong> : The mind clings to fixed perspectives to maintain a stable reality. People fear the destabilization of their reality through exposure to radically different worldviews, which could deconstruct their understanding of existence and self.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural relativity and deeper metaphysics</strong> : Cultural practices are recognized as relative, but people seldom recognize the deeper relativity affecting their metaphysical beliefs. This deeper level can radically differ from mainstream views and challenge one's entire concept of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Xenophobia and its psychological roots</strong> : Xenophobia and dogmatism partly arise from avoiding psychologically challenging or traumatic situations. Exposure to diverse perspectives and cultures can dissolve xenophobic tendencies, but this often requires confronting discomfort and challenging long-held beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Justifications within perspectives</strong> : Perspectives are accompanied by justifications that make them appear as the only valid way to see the world; for example, individuals may rationalize avoiding unsettling situations like confronting poverty or violence in other cultures, as it challenges deeply held views and comfort zones.</li>
<li><strong>Traumatic shift to radical perspectives</strong> : Transitioning to a perspective where oneself or reality doesn't exist can be traumatic, as it directly contradicts ingrained beliefs and the core identity, leading to profound discomfort and fear akin to being stranded in a hostile environment.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing diverse perspectives</strong> : Leo advocates for the exploration of various perspectives to achieve true open-mindedness, believing that only through confronting radical viewpoints can one escape the constraints of their own perspective and gain a richer understanding of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure to conform to single perspectives</strong> : Leo observes that social institutions, teachers, and schools often pressure individuals to adopt their specific worldview-whether in spirituality, science, or education-compromising the exploration and understanding of alternate points of view.</li>
<li><strong>Trade-offs of perspective approaches</strong> : Leo emphasizes that all perspectives, including his meta perspective, have pros and cons. His approach allows for a broader comprehension of reality and reduces the risk of becoming stuck in one perspective, but it may also lead to confusion and delay in achieving goals such as enlightenment.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of exploring multiple perspectives</strong> : Leo suggests that by examining many perspectives without clinging to any single one, the likelihood of becoming stuck is greatly reduced-fostering an adaptable and open-minded approach toward enlightenment and understanding reality.</li>
<li><strong>Downsides of a singular approach</strong> : Committing to only one worldview or teacher could result in adopting a limited perspective or alignment with someone who might not truly guide you to enlightenment. He compares this to the risk of being overcharged for a TV due to not price-checking across multiple stores.</li>
<li><strong>Richness of diverse experiences</strong> : Having encountered and synthesized a broad range of perspectives, Leo expresses a deeper appreciation of life's richness, encouraging others to similarly explore and appreciate diversity instead of succumbing to xenophobia or dogmatism.</li>
<li><strong>Impermanence of perspectives and reality</strong> : Leo discusses the concept of no perspective being the ultimate perspective, equating it to a deep state of enlightenment where one realizes that both the self and reality are constructions of individual perspectives within the infinity of existence.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural design against diversity</strong> : Society and culture often deter exploration of alternative perspectives. Leo encourages challenging this trend to gain a more complete and eclectic understanding of reality, akin to the way experiencing various cuisines enhances one's appreciation for food.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing diversity aligns with the universe's essence</strong> : By embracing the universe's inherent diversity, we align with the nature of existence, which contradicts narrow, anti-diversity stances evident in xenophobia and narrow teachings that limit understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Fear as the root of limited perspective</strong> : Leo identifies fear from past experiences as the underlying cause for resisting new experiences, such as trying different foods or embracing unfamiliar perspectives, emphasizing the importance of moving beyond this fear to truly engage with the diverse possibilities of life.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate exploration journey towards Nirvana</strong> : The exploration of perspectives can ultimately lead to the erasure of the self and the experience of Nirvana-a perspective devoid of concrete reality. Returning from this state with a broadened worldview allows one to appreciate both the finite and the infinite aspects of existence.</li>
