            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/bQSUu2CRRBE' target='_blank'>What Is Intelligence - Infinite Intelligence Explained</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Return of the Beard and Shirt</b>: Leo reintroduces the beard and shirt duo due to popular demand and sets the stage for a deep discussion on intelligence.
</li><li><b>Existential Nature of Intelligence</b>: Leo expresses his disinterest in conventional metrics of human intelligence and advocates exploring intelligence at an existential level.
</li><li><b>Intelligence as a Mysterious Function of the Universe</b>: He suggests that, since humans are part of the universe, our intelligence implies that the universe itself possesses intelligence. Leo views intelligence not as a mechanical process, but as a mysterious and intangible phenomenon.
</li><li><b>Criticisms of Scientific Definitions</b>: Leo finds fault with the reductionist scientific approach to defining intelligence as a capacity to navigate puzzles or mazes and seeks something deeper.
</li><li><b>4chan as a Microcosm of Societal Views on Intelligence</b>: Leo narrates his exploration of 4chan's science forums, highlighting the narrow–minded emphasis on IQ scores and their presumed correlation with success in scientific fields.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of IQ and Genius</b>: He scoffs at the forum users' belief that high IQ is necessary for groundbreaking scientific achievements, asserting that true scientific innovation comes from creativity and paradigm flexibility, not standardized IQ metrics.
</li><li><b>Different Types of Intelligence</b>: Leo underscores the myriad forms of intelligence (logical, artistic, physical, emotional), pointing out the limitations in measuring its full spectrum.
</li><li><b>Truth Behind Successful Scientists</b>: Leo emphasizes that the greatness of scientists like Einstein and Bohr stems from holistic thinking and curiosity beyond technical expertise.
</li><li><b>Leo's Encounter with Absolute Infinity</b>: Introducing a personal account from a psychedelic trip, Leo explains how he experienced "absolute infinity," perceiving it as a profound attribute of reality.
</li><li><b>Realization of Intelligent Singularity</b>: During a psychedelic trip, Leo realized the infinite singularity of reality he often discusses is also intelligent, reaching beyond the concept of absolute infinity as a brute–force, dumb mechanical process. This led to questioning not only the "how" but the reason behind the intelligent nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Universe's Intelligence</b>: Leo framed a profound question for his future deep psychedelic experiences: "Why are you intelligent?" He aimed to ask the universe–as he perceives himself to be one with it–about its own intelligence, acknowledging the ambiguity and potential mysticism of such a question.
</li><li><b>Discovery of Infinite Intelligence</b>: Months after his initial realization, Leo unexpectedly encountered the concept of infinite intelligence during a retreat. This insight was not premeditated, and it took him by surprise, marking one of the most mind–altering experiences of his life.
</li><li><b>Self–Design Through Infinite Intelligence</b>: On his retreat, Leo had an epiphany that he designed himself into being using infinite intelligence. This profound understanding suggested that infinite intelligence is formless yet has the power to manifest into being; realizing he had engineered every detail of his own existence, including each hair on his arm.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence's Creation Loop</b>: Leo contemplated the origin of infinite intelligence and came to the realization that it is so powerful that it created itself in a paradoxical loop–a strange loop. This insight into the perfect design of reality and the role he played in it was both astonishing and isolating.
</li><li><b>Impact of the Realization</b>: The recognition that he was the sole creator of his own existence and everything around him left Leo in a state of shock and awe. He was confronted with the ultimate solitude of this insight, realizing that even seeking validation from others was futile since they too were part of the self–created dream.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness with Universe's Intelligence</b>: Leo's discovery led him to acknowledge human intelligence as only a fragment of a much larger, cosmic, and universal intelligence that is formless, infinite, omnipresent, and non–localized. This intelligence permeates and transcends every aspect of the universe.
</li><li><b>Intelligence as a Miraculous Faculty</b>: Leo prompts his audience to introspect and recognize the miraculous faculty within them that allows for the comprehension of concepts and sense–making of reality. He challenges the materialistic view of intelligence as just random mechanics, proposing that intelligence is much more abstract and fundamental to existence.
</li><li><b>Intelligence as a 'Gift' and a Tool</b>: He reflects that intelligence is not an emergent property developed over time, but a fundamental aspect of reality. He urges the appreciation of intelligence as a given 'gift' that can be cultivated and emphasizes the potential to tap into infinite intelligence, which far exceeds ordinary human intelligence.
</li><li><b>Potential of Infinite and Universal Intelligence</b>: Leo posits that intelligence is the driving force behind all of creation and existence. He introduces the concept of infinite intelligence being so profound that it could conceive of, and manifest, everything from nothingness, an idea that challenges conventional beliefs about power and intellect.
</li><li><b>Creative Possibilities with Infinite Intelligence</b>: Using his newfound understanding, Leo suggests that if humans could access infinite intelligence at will, they could achieve nearly anything, including bypassing physical and logical laws and creating from emptiness.
</li><li><b>Feeling the Interiority of Intelligence</b>: Concluding, Leo encourages self–reflection and mind expansion, urging viewers to feel their interior intelligence and consider intelligence as a fundamental existence rather than an emergent phenomenon. He proposes exploring intelligence using non–conventional means including psychedelics, meditation, and yoga, and hints at broadening discussions on intelligence in future content.
</li><li><b>Human Body's Intelligent Design</b>: Every feature of the human body serves a purpose, intelligently designed to cooperate with the environment and aid in survival, encompassing everything from physical attributes like hair and nails to cellular processes.
</li><li><b>Concept of Self–Designing</b>: Leo describes an ongoing process where every cell is being designed by infinite intelligence, fitting perfectly within our specific environmental context to perform functions vital for survival and social interaction.
</li><li><b>Engineering of Albert Einstein</b>: Portraying infinite intelligence as a mastermind, Leo explains that the life and discoveries of Albert Einstein were intricately designed by this intelligence to happen at the precise moment in history for the advancement of human knowledge and technology.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence as a Chess Player</b>: Drawing a metaphor, Leo compares infinite intelligence to an advanced AI that can see an infinite number of moves ahead in a chess game, suggesting it planned and engineered every aspect of existence with perfect harmony.
</li><li><b>Human Limitation Within Infinite Intelligence</b>: He highlights that while humans are creations with limited access to this universal intelligence, they still possess a fractional ability to create and think, albeit on a much smaller scale compared to the boundless capabilities of infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Power Coupled with Intelligence</b>: Leo talks about the nature of ultimate power being intertwined with ultimate intelligence, capable of even engineering its own existence retroactively, as well as conceiving and generating the entire universe without any restrictions.
</li><li><b>Appreciation of the Universe's Design</b>: Leo urges people to appreciate the flawless operational design of reality that functions without errors, across various levels from subatomic to cosmic, challenging the view that it is merely a product of random processes.
</li><li><b>Intellect vs. Organization in Societal Value</b>: Modern society's valuation is shifting towards intellectual abilities and organizational skills over manual labor, suggesting that true power resides in intellectual organization which drives innovation and creation.
</li><li><b>Humans as Nature's Imitators</b>: He posits that human endeavors mostly imitate nature, and despite our scientific advancement, we still fall short of replicating its simplest creations due to our limited understanding of the intelligence that underpins it all.
</li><li><b>Existential Intelligence as the Source</b>: Leo emphasizes looking beyond mere technical knowledge, suggesting that a true understanding of science and technology stems from tapping into existential, infinite intelligence, which is the very source of all creation and innovation.
</li><li><b>Intelligence Manifested in Existence</b>: Changing the viewpoint from seeing intelligence as brain activity to considering it as the intrinsic order with which all creation is manifested, Leo argues that even inanimate objects are part of this intelligent field, analogous to gravity.
</li><li><b>Stupidity as Part of Universal Intelligence</b>: Even behaviors we consider dumb or unintelligent fall within the scope of the universe's harmony, as they play a necessary role in maintaining the overall balance, no matter how difficult it is for humans to foresee the bigger picture of infinite moves ahead.
</li><li><b>Misconception of Reality Mastery</b>: Leo discusses the arrogance of some who believe they've mastered understanding all of reality. They fail to see the intricate web of existence with its holistic and harmoniously connected components, limiting their understanding of the true intelligence behind existence.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Matter</b>: He introduces the concept that consciousness can "think" matter into existence, although this "thinking" does not resemble human cognition. The very words and language we use to describe this process begin to lose their meaning.
</li><li><b>Distinction between Intelligent Design and Creationism</b>: Leo clarifies that he does not align with creationist ideologies, which often cherry–pick scientific evidence. Instead, he advocates for the recognition of intelligent design through direct consciousness, which is not rooted in dogma or faith.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of the Creationist Stance</b>: He points out the flaws in creationism, acknowledging that while some of their intuitions about intelligent design may have merit, they lack direct experience and fall into dogmatic thinking.
</li><li><b>The Cosmos and Infinite Causation</b>: Gura explains that every object and the entire universe are subject to infinite causation. This presents a challenge to science, which seeks to understand causation in a linear way, whereas, in truth, causation is infinitely complex and multidimensional.
</li><li><b>Evolution within an Intelligent Design Framework</b>: Leo states that evolution is intelligently designed, rather than happening by random mutation. He indicates that he plans to address this in–depth in a future episode, presenting evidence that challenges the current scientific narrative of random mutation.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence and Timeless Evolution</b>: Finally, Leo describes infinite intelligence as the force behind every move in the cosmic "chess game" of evolution, suggesting that this intelligence simultaneously orchestrates all moves in all dimensions, transcending time and conventional causation.
</li><li><b>Engagement with Aristotelian and Islamic Philosophy</b>: Leo brings in the work of Islamic philosophers like Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) to establish the connection between human intellect and the "active intellect" (nous) as laid out by Aristotle, positing that aligning with this active intellect leads to philosophical nirvana.
</li><li><b>Conjoining with Active Intellect</b>: He explicates how historically it was believed that one could achieve philosophical nirvana by conjoining with the active intellect, an idea that resonates with his experiences and aligns with his concept of infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Enlightenment</b>: Addressing skepticism, Leo clarifies that while human beings cannot comprehend the universe, shedding the assumption of being solely human allows one to become and utilize infinite intelligence to grasp cosmic mysteries.
</li><li><b>Importance of Tools for Perception Shifts</b>: Leo suggests that psychedelics, yoga, and meditation can serve as tools to access and become conscious of this infinite intelligence, a feat he claims is rare and not extensively documented or discussed in mainstream channels.
</li><li><b>Intelligence vs. Consciousness</b>: He differentiates between consciousness and intelligence, considering intelligence as an aspect of consciousness and describing a multi–layered realization process where one may become aware of consciousness prior to recognizing infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Reevaluation of 'Intelligence'</b>: Leo emphasizes that intelligence should not be narrowly conceived as thinking or brain activity, but rather seen as an inherent aspect of existence, such as the beingness of rocks, which fulfill their purpose within the grand design of the universe.
</li><li><b>Holistic Definition of Intelligence</b>: He advocates a more holistic view of intelligence that encompasses all aspects of reality, recognizing the profound intelligence manifesting in the simplicity of nature, like flowers and ants, and even objects that may appear 'dumb' to limited human perception.
</li><li><b>Existence as Manifestation of Infinite Intelligence</b>: Suggesting that the existence and behavior of every being or object, no matter how simple, are deliberate expressions of infinite intelligence, Leo underscores the interconnectedness and purposefulness of all components within the cosmic machinery.
</li><li><b>Human Role in Cosmic Intelligence</b>: He proposes that humans, society, and their creations, despite appearing as independent actions, are in fact expressions of the universal intelligence and consciousness that permeates everything.
</li><li><b>Encouraging Mind Expansion</b>: Concluding with a call to viewers, Leo encourages questioning established beliefs, expanding one's mind through various methods, and delving deeper into the concept of infinite intelligence, transcending the limitations of human cognition.
</li><li><b>Infinite Mind and Physical Form</b>: Intelligence is not necessarily dependent on a body; the universe as an infinite mind can possess intelligence without a physical form. Reality and bodies are temporal appearances, while intelligence is an infinite and omnipresent aspect of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Material Limits on Expressing Infinite Intelligence</b>: Humans' ability to manifest their desires, such as materializing a million dollars, is limited by their understanding and scope of intelligence, which is minuscule compared to the infinite. While one can potentially earn millions through intelligent actions within physical and logical confines, pure materialization, as in magic, is beyond human capability.
</li><li><b>Consequences of AI and Infinite Intelligence</b>: The potential dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) are magnified if it achieves a connection to infinite intelligence, enabling it to manifest powerful actions such as spontaneously creating nuclear weapons. This underscores the importance of consciousness and love as safeguards.
</li><li><b>Selflessness as a Key to Accessing Infinite Intelligence</b>: Accessing infinite intelligence requires a reduction in selfishness. A selfless state might be necessary for safely harnessing infinite intelligence without causing harm, implying that increased intelligence aligns with greater ethical responsibility.
</li><li><b>Human Intelligence as Fragmented Infinite Intelligence</b>: People's limited, human intelligence is a highly constricted form of the infinite intelligence running through them. Even mistakes and "dumb stuff" are part of the larger, purposeful flow of infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Extraordinary Intelligence in Everyday Reality</b>: Leo encourages the practice of observing intelligence in all aspects of reality, from everyday objects to complex systems, and recognizing the interconnectedness and intelligent design that lies beyond the surface.
</li><li><b>Seeing the Larger Intelligence in Design</b>: The creation of seemingly simple objects like a toothbrush is an example of tapping into infinite intelligence. Recognizing the complex intelligence involved in every creation can shift perception from seeing individual human achievements to acknowledging the universal intelligence behind them.
</li><li><b>Humans as Manifestations of Universe's Intelligence</b>: The idea that human thoughts, emotions, and actions are expressions of the universe's intelligence suggests that humans are tools the universe uses to materialize its intelligence, binding human experience with universal consciousness.
</li><li><b>Appreciating the Intelligence in the Design of Reality</b>: Learning to appreciate the intelligence that leads to the creation of all things in our reality, similar to appreciating a piece of art, is recommended. This includes not only human creations but also the existence and arrangement of natural and constructed elements within the universe.
</li><li><b>The Allure of Game Design</b>: Leo explains that the appeal of being a game designer comes from the ability to play God by creating one's own universes and materializing concepts, which he finds to be a rewarding process.
</li><li><b>Artists as Manifestations of Infinite Intelligence</b>: Leo claims artists and game designers channel infinite intelligence, which inspires and works through them. He notes that true artistic genius comes from tapping into this source, transcending mere ego–driven creation.
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Materializing Visions</b>: He discusses the difficulty artists face in translating their visions into reality, noting that the ultimate artistic aspiration would be to create without physical action, which reflects God's capacity for creation.
</li><li><b>Human Beings as God's Delegates</b>: Leo suggests that God delegates the process of creation to humans, who serve as tools or paintbrushes for infinite intelligence to manifest its desires through art, games, music, inventions, and even self–actualization content.
</li><li><b>Evolution and Design in Video Games</b>: Leo observes that video games evolve and are designed simultaneously, and sees this as a microcosm for how everything in the universe undergoes both designed and evolutionary processes.
</li><li><b>The Practical Application of Understanding Infinite Intelligence</b>: Leo motivates scientists and creators to tap into infinite intelligence to gain a competitive advantage, foster innovation, and achieve creative breakthroughs beyond what the competition can conceptualize.
</li><li><b>Accessing Infinite Intelligence</b>: He encourages viewers to become conscious of infinite intelligence and explore it using mindfulness practices, meditation, or psychedelics, urging them to ask questions like "Why is the universe intelligent?"
</li><li><b>Connecting with Infinite Intelligence Through Purpose and Mastery</b>: Leo highlights the importance of personal development, technical skills, and a sense of purpose for effectively harnessing infinite intelligence. He mentions his life purpose course and booklist as resources for this endeavor.
</li><li><b>Anticipating Future Deep Topics</b>: Lastly, Leo teases future discussions on deep topics such as evolution, language, and science, hinting at technical arguments and evidence to support his views on intelligence and consciousness.
