            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-GZSsI3aaI8' target='_blank'>Does Free Will Exist - What Is Will</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Advanced nature of the free will conversation</strong> : Leo emphasizes the complexity of the free will topic, suggesting that it requires numerous awakenings and deep contemplation of existence for a proper understanding, which he claims to have achieved after many awakenings. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as distinctions within consciousness</strong> : He explains reality as an infinite field of consciousness that imagines distinctions, and "freedom" or "control" are just some of these distinctions being dreamed up. </li>
<li><strong>Dualistic nature of control and freedom</strong> : Control is viewed as a duality, with distinctions between controller and controlled, and likewise, freedom involves recognizing constraints that define and limit what freedom actually means. </li>
<li><strong>Relativistic identity and control</strong> : Leo points out the importance of how one defines "you". He argues that if one sees themselves as just a part of the universe, they cannot control the whole while identifying as the entire universe changes the entire concept of control. </li>
<li><strong>Self-control of the universe</strong> : When considering the universe as a whole, without external influences, it suggests that the universe controls itself, which changes the perspective on free will when one's identity includes the entire universe. </li>
<li><strong>Controller vs. Controlled</strong> : By questioning who controls the universe, Leo challenges the traditional division of controller and controlled, explaining that if we see them as one, the question of control becomes irrelevant, as it would be self-controlling. </li>
<li><strong>Constraints as Universe Imposed</strong> : Leo explains that many of the constraints we perceive are not due to our choices but are seen as inherent limitations of our being - like not being able to jump 50 feet high, which is attributed to physics and not personal free will. </li>
<li><strong>Identity and Perceived Limitations</strong> : The understanding of limitations changes based on how one identifies themselves. If you see yourself as separate from the universe or the planet, then those are construed as limiting you. However, expanding one's identity to include the entire universe alters this perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Universe's Freedom Based on Identity</strong> : By considering oneself as the entire universe, one might ponder if the universe itself is free from constraints. Since the universe has no outside, it leads to the question of what could possibly limit its freedom. </li>
<li><strong>Universe Versus Physical and Logical Laws</strong> : The perception that physical and logical laws limit the universe is scrutinized. Leo argues that if everything, including these laws, is part of the universe, then nothing external is truly constraining it. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Defining and Self-Controlling Universe</strong> : Leo states that the universe defines, creates, and constrains itself however it wants, which indicates that in an absolute sense, the universe is completely free - free with a capital F. </li>
<li><strong>Material Manifestation as Universe's Will</strong> : In his awakening, Leo realized that everything in the universe, including material objects like chairs and rocks, is a crystallization of the universe's will, challenging the notion that will is an attribute only living creatures possess. </li>
<li><strong>Human Ego and Universal Will</strong> : He observes that humans often limit their understanding of will to their personal desires, neglecting the concept of a universal will that belongs to the entire universe and everything in it. </li>
<li><strong>Hummingbird Analogy for Human Struggle</strong> : Leo likens the human struggle to control life to a hummingbird trying to fly through a hurricane, suggesting that we may mistakenly identify as the struggling hummingbird when we could be the entire hurricane, including the bird. </li>
<li><strong>Progression towards God Consciousness</strong> : As one approaches God consciousness, the ego dissolves, leading to the loss of self, neediness, attachment, and biases. At peak consciousness, mundane concerns like survival, money, and relationships become irrelevant because all distinctions are seen as imaginary. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Will as Sovereign Imagination</strong> : True infinite will is understood as the capacity to imagine without limit. The infinite mind, or God, has complete control over itself, recognizing that all perceived external elements are actually internal dissociations. Integrating these leads to absolute sovereignty. </li>
<li><strong>Human vs God Identity Realization</strong> : Realizing that there is no separation between human and God leads to the extinguishing of the human ego, and only the divine remains. This realization brings awareness that reality is perfect as it is, a manifestation of God's will which is identical to one's own. </li>
<li><strong>Divine Surrender Over Ego Manipulation</strong> : At high consciousness levels, one doesn't use divine will to improve life selfishly, but experiences surrender to life's perfect flow, realizing that everything happening is optimally orchestrated by God's perfect will, which is also one's own. </li>
<li><strong>Material Reality as Manifestation of Will</strong> : Physical reality, including material objects, are expressions of will, manifestations of the divine imagination, and exist only within the realm of the mind of God. Recognizing this, the seemingly material world is understood as a denser form of mind "stuff." </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of Free Will and Universal Will</strong> : The notion that there is no free will is revised to show that everything is actually infinite will. Wakefulness to this leads to the understanding that all reality is shaped by universal will, not personal, limited ego-thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Imaginary Distinctions and True Self-Recognition</strong> : Through God consciousness, one becomes aware that distinctions such as unicorns or chairs are mental constructs within the mind of God. This consciousness helps dissolve false identities and aligns one with the intelligence that flows through all existence. </li>
<li><strong>Universe as Intelligent Flow</strong> : Understanding life as an intelligent flow dispels the exhausting struggle of ego against the universe. By fully embracing one's universal identity, the futile mindset of fighting against oneself is replaced with harmonious alignment with universal intelligence and will. </li>
<li><strong>Letting Go of Clinging Through Universal Consciousness</strong> : Relinquishing attachments frees one's potential, as aligning with infinite, universal intelligence and will is recognized as truly one's own. This allows one to flow with the highest will, transcending the limited, ego-centric will. </li>
<li><strong>Profundity of Oneness</strong> : Oneness implies infinite power to manifest anything imagined, which people often fail to fully comprehend. True oneness is tantamount to omnipotence within the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Grasping Oneness</strong> : Achieving understanding of oneness cannot be solely conceptual but must involve absolute infinite consciousness. This includes awareness of one's role in constructing the universe, which demands superhuman levels of consciousness beyond normal practice. </li>
<li><strong>Constraint on God&#39;s Will</strong> : God has the power of infinite will, constrained only by the principle that it must be absolute love. At this highest level of consciousness, love, intelligence, truth, goodness, and God are indistinguishable, guiding all manifestations in the material world. </li>
<li><strong>Manifestation of Infinite Love</strong> : Rather than acting on whims, infinite consciousness manifests as materializations of love. This is the singular purpose and necessity at the highest level of consciousness â€“ realized through selflessness and intelligence. </li>
<li><strong>Healing as a Consequence of Infinite Love</strong> : In scenarios like healing a loved one's cancer, the outcome is not driven by self-interest but rather determined by what is aligned with the highest love. Surrendering to this flow signifies acceptance of the perfect will of God. </li>
<li><strong>Surrender to God&#39;s Will</strong> : True surrender to God&#39;s will involves becoming one with it, without attempts to dictate or improve upon it. This demands a humility to accept even tragic outcomes, like a loved one's death, as a part of the highest good. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Distorting Perception of the Highest Good</strong> : Human biases, attachment, fear, and suffering can prevent one from understanding and accepting the highest good. The highest good often requires a broader perspective that goes beyond individual needs. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and Food Creation</strong> : The freedom granted by God to humans to create their society entails responsibility, including the types of food produced and consumed. Selfish actions by individuals are thus seen as contributing factors to issues like cancer, rather than the will of a malevolent God. </li>
<li><strong>Growth Through Self-Created Challenges</strong> : Life's purpose is found in facing challenges and learning from mistakes. God&#39;s refusal to solve all problems is seen as an opportunity for humans to grow and realize their potential by making conscious, self-guided decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Becoming God Through Self-Surrender</strong> : The path to God-like consciousness involves the surrender of selfishness and biases. Humans evolve by recognizing their self-created problems and then accepting responsibility and changing themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Selfishness and Suffering</strong> : Leo warns that a life lived selfishly is bound to be full of suffering. He advises that relinquishing selfishness must come from one's own free will, as it's intertwined with goodness and love, which cannot be imposed by force. </li>
<li><strong>Qualities of the Highest Will</strong> : At the highest level, infinite will is equated with goodness and love. To align with God, one must will themselves to embody love and goodness because nothing can compel God to be anything; God must choose it. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility for Self-definition</strong> : People often abdicate the responsibility to define themselves, relegating it to science, religion, or other external authorities. Leo emphasizes the importance of taking personal responsibility for self-definition, as it's key to awakening to one's true God self. </li>
<li><strong>Owning Your Reality</strong> : Leo stresses the necessity of acknowledging that we each create our own reality. Unable or unwilling to take responsibility for their circumstances, many people fail to realize their potential as the universe's creators, their God self. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of God's Free Will</strong> : God possesses free will but is paradoxically bound by it because all of God's will is committed to infinite love. This might appear limiting from a human perspective but represents the ultimate purpose and strength from a divine standpoint. </li>
<li><strong>Human vs. Divine Perception of Power</strong> : From a human viewpoint, God may seem powerless because we cannot manipulate our conditions for selfish needs. However, this is a limited view. True weakness lies in sacrificing the greater good for selfish desires. </li>
<li><strong>Manipulation vs. Alignment with God's Will</strong> : Humans can manipulate reality, but only to a limited extent. True fulfillment and freedom from suffering come from aligning with God's infinite intelligence, love, and goodness rather than employing finite, manipulative strategies. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Spiritual Work</strong> : Spiritual practice aims to purge ego and elevate consciousness, allowing one to become a vessel for divine intelligence. Mastery and flow in life, akin to riding a bicycle effortlessly, come from attuning to a higher guiding force, which is our expanded self. </li>
<li><strong>Flow and Mastery</strong> : Leo explains that true mastery, such as riding a bicycle, comes from a state of flow, which requires practice, letting go of fear, and not being hindered by neurotic concerns about potential danger. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness and Spiritual Awakening</strong> : Spiritual teachers often lack the depth in explaining the concept of will, which requires holistic realization of God. Leo encourages continued deep spiritual practice to become aware that reality is a manifestation of our will, necessary for true awakening.</li>
