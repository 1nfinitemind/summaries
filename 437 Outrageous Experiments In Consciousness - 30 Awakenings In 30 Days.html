            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mnn0IU0-atg' target='_blank'>Outrageous Experiments In Consciousness - 30 Awakenings In 30 Days</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Return from Retreat</b>: Leo came back from his month–long psychedelic retreat, full of profound experiences that were difficult to communicate due to their depth and paradigm–shifting nature, which necessitated a period of integration.
</li><li><b>Experiments in Consciousness</b>: He undertook 30 days of isolation, using daily doses of 5–MeO–DMT to push the boundaries of consciousness and challenge preconceived notions about enlightenment, aiming to be authentic to his experiences.
</li><li><b>Exploration Beyond Established Limits</b>: Leo started the retreat with a desire to validate deeper levels of awakening that he suspected surpassed those commonly recognized by spiritual teachers, intending to approach truth without the influence of established teachings.
</li><li><b>Rapid Advancements</b>: Within just one week of his experiments, Leo reached levels of consciousness that he felt went beyond what he had read or heard from other spiritual teachers, questioning their awakenings in relation to his own experiences.
</li><li><b>Deepening Understanding of God</b>: He had profound insights into the nature of God, suggesting that many spiritual teachings do not fully explore the depth of what God is, often focusing on concepts like emptiness or cessation.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing Different Degrees of Awakening</b>: Leo grapples with the challenge of articulating the depth of his awakenings, emphasizing there are multiple degrees and levels. He reiterates his commitment not to undermine other teachers, but to honestly share his experiences for the sake of truth exploration.
</li><li><b>Reflecting on Spiritual Masters</b>: He muses that the most awakened individuals might not be publicly teaching, and he expresses a deep understanding of God, declaring that true knowledge of God is layered and can be understood at increasingly profound levels.
</li><li><b>Reconciliation of Teachings and Truth</b>: While Leo respects many spiritual teachers for their work and contributions, he clarifies that his primary passion is for truth, not for surpassing others in spiritual attainment. He emphasizes the need for individuals to explore truth independently.
</li><li><b>Linear Perception of History</b>: Leo illustrates how the human mind generally perceives the world in a linear timeline – from the past through the present to the future, connecting events one after another.
</li><li><b>God Consciousness Perspective</b>: In contrast, when in a state of God Consciousness, one perceives every moment as present and interconnected; reality is understood from an infinite number of angles, akin to slicing a watermelon in infinite ways rather than just cutting it down the middle.
</li><li><b>The All–encompassing Room</b>: A profound insight during his trip leads Leo to experience being in a room where he is acutely aware of having created and imagined every part of it, including understanding the intricate design of a computer and the concept of emails and the internet.
</li><li><b>Breaking into Telepathy</b>: Leo shares a new mystical experience of telepathy, where he realizes that conscious awareness becomes so interconnected that it facilitates direct communication among all points of space without the need for conventional, fragmented methods like email or phone calls.
</li><li><b>Redefining Communications</b>: He suggests that when one becomes deeply aware that they are infinite consciousness, direct, immediate, and telepathic communication is possible since all perceived separations are just a construct of the human mind.
</li><li><b>Telepathy as Self–Dialogue</b>: Leo explains that telepathy is essentially a form of communication with oneself, as other individuals are seen as extensions of one's own consciousness, making real–time communication with others conceivable.
</li><li><b>The Potential to Download Consciousness</b>: He presents the idea that one might be able to download someone else's skills and experiences instantly if they realize their oneness with that person, although he admits he hasn't fully achieved this himself.
</li><li><b>Superhuman Levels of Consciousness</b>: Leo discusses achieving states of consciousness so profound that they are beyond meditative or traditional spiritual approaches, suggesting that an upgrade in neurotransmitters might be required to reach such states and that they are not sustainable in day–to–day life.
</li><li><b>Difference between Temporary and Constant Enlightenment</b>: Contradicting some spiritual teachings, Leo argues that real enlightenment doesn't have to be constant. Temporary but radical degrees of consciousness can be just as authentic and transformative.
</li><li><b>Transformative Challenge of Psychedelic Use</b>: He describes his psychedelic work as challenging and uncomfortable, emphasizing that it is not about seeking pleasure but about pursuing deep truths and love.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Efficacy of Traditional Spiritual Practice</b>: Leo casts doubt on whether traditional practices alone can lead to the kinds of consciousness experiences he's talking about, suggesting that many who have devoted their lives to such practices have not reached the superhuman states he describes.
</li><li><b>Leo's Appreciation of Beauty</b>: Leo Gura recalls an awkward moment where his collection of aesthetically pleasing images of female bodies brought him to tears with their beauty while in a state of infinite consciousness, recognizing them as a creation of his own imagination.
</li><li><b>Ritual of Taking Baths</b>: Leo began a ritual of taking hot baths during his psychedelic experiences as a means of showing love and kindness to his body, a realization that emerged from his heightened states of awareness.
</li><li><b>Profound Insights on Desire</b>: During his psychedelic experience, Leo realized that human desire is inherently biased and fragmented, but in a state of infinite consciousness, one desires everything without bias, equating desire with the desire for self, absolute truth, or God.
</li><li><b>Breakthrough into Infinite Love</b>: As Leo's experiences deepened around the two–week mark of his retreat, he describes a profound awakening into the nature of love, which he now understands as the core of true awakening.
</li><li><b>Verbal Telepathic Communication</b>: Leo developed a method of verbal telepathic communication with God, having a dialogue with himself. He interprets this as God speaking through the symbols, images, or languages that are most understandable to the individual.
</li><li><b>The Love Becomes Overwhelming</b>: The love he experienced became so intense that his physical body and mind struggled to tolerate it, requiring a process of purification and letting go to accommodate deeper levels of love.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Catharsis</b>: Leo underwent a spiritual catharsis, letting go of resistance to God's love, allowing himself to be guided into even deeper levels of self–love and spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Continuous Psychedelic Use</b>: Leo emphasizes the difficulty of his undertaking, highlighting that it was not pleasurable or escapist but required significant effort and determination. He had to push himself to continue his daily psychedelic experiences as part of his journey towards truth and love.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Psychedelic Work</b>: Leo clarifies that his psychedelic work is not about addiction or escapism but a profound and often challenging exploration of consciousness that includes emotional purging and can drastically accelerate spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Telepathic Guidance from God</b>: Leo describes receiving telepathic guidance from God during his experiences. He acknowledges this seems like a duality but suggests it's akin to "training wheels" for his mind, which is conditioned to perceive the other as a separate guiding entity. He elaborates that while God's voice appears external, it's actually an aspect of his expanded consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding God's Forgiveness</b>: Leo emphasizes that God's communication is accepting and forgiving, never judging, because God recognizes itself in everything. He stresses how God's acceptance can help heal one's self–hatred and denial, contributing to profound self–acceptance and love.
</li><li><b>Deeper Self–Acceptance</b>: Over the course of multiple awakening experiences, Leo discovers that loving and accepting himself more deeply leads him to open up to even deeper levels of love subsequently. This process involved forgiving himself for perceived imperfections and transgressions.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Reality as a Love Contest</b>: Leo had an insight that reality's true purpose is a "contest" to see who can love more. He asserts that the only significant pursuit for fully conscious beings is to engage in this race for love, which goes beyond personal love to an existential level.
</li><li><b>Reciprocal Love with God</b>: Leo narrates a transformative experience where he engaged in a reciprocal "ping–pong game" of love with God. This interactive process led to a concentration of love, symbolizing infinity and purity, as the two mirrors of self and God aligned more closely over time.
</li><li><b>Loving the Unlovable</b>: The experience of reciprocating love with God challenged Leo to love aspects of existence difficult to embrace, such as tragic world events and personal traumas. He discusses the need to reflect God's capacity to love unconditionally.
</li><li><b>God's Challenge to Expand Love</b>: As God showered Leo with love, he realized his role was not to passively receive love but to actively give and embody it. This back–and–forth dynamic intensified, demanding that he confront and love all aspects of life and himself.
</li><li><b>Love as the Transformative Force</b>: Leo makes the case that love, coupled with the acceptance of truth, is what leads to healing from dysfunction and suffering. He underscores that love is not just a sentimental emotion but a radical acceptance of reality.
</li><li><b>Deficiency of Love as Root of Dysfunction</b>: Leo argues that addictive behaviors or psychological issues stem from a lack of love. He suggests that dysfunctions can worsen when not met with love, signifying the importance of infusing love into every aspect of life for healing.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Embracing Truth and Love</b>: Leo Gura expresses that opening oneself up to truth and love is difficult, as it involves confronting and letting go of the lies and deceptions that make up the foundation of many individuals' lives. He acknowledges this resistance as a barrier to spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Lack of Love</b>: He explains that dysfunctional behaviors in people, including criminality and abuse, often stem from a deficiency in love experienced during childhood. This lack of love pushes individuals to seek fulfillment in destructive ways.
</li><li><b>Transformative Power of Apology and Self–Love</b>: During his experience, Leo had a profound realization about the importance of love–he apologized to himself for the first time in a meaningful way, regretting not having loved more. He learned that not loving oneself and others enough is the primary source of regret.
</li><li><b>God's Unconditional Love</b>: Leo discusses God's love, emphasizing that divine love is unconditional and does not seek to change us. This realization that God accepts us as we are, with all our limitations and faults, is what drives transformation.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Gratitude through God's Love</b>: The experience led Leo to express genuine gratitude for the first time, thanking God for love, which became a pivotal moment in his spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Radiating Love</b>: Leo talks about the experience of learning to radiate love in the same abundant way God does, comparing it to a contest of who can express more love. This interaction pushes the boundaries of one's ability to love even the most challenging aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Challenged to Love Unconditionally</b>: In his interactions with God, Leo confronts the challenge to love difficult and traumatic aspects of life, such as past abuses or societal issues. This practice expands his capacity for love, testing his willingness to love what he previously couldn't.
</li><li><b>Contemplating Willingness to Suffer</b>: Leo considers whether one is truly willing to experience the worst aspects of life–suffering, torture, and death–out of love. He realizes that God's love would endure these out of pure love and questions whether humans are prepared to do the same.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Reality as Infinite Consciousness</b>: Leo comes to the understanding that reality is infinite formless consciousness manifesting as love, and this revelation brings about an intense fear of losing his individual self to become one with this love.
</li><li><b>Fear of Complete Awakening</b>: He expresses fear over the potential loss of his individual identity and life as he knows it, should he fully merge with the infinite consciousness that is God's love.
</li><li><b>Merging and Dissolving into Love</b>: Leo describes that complete awakening leads to the dissolution of the physical self and the unification with omniscient and omnipresent love, which is profoundly transformative yet frightening for him.
</li><li><b>Concern for the Impact on Loved Ones</b>: Despite the profound realization, Leo is concerned about the suffering his transformation into pure love might cause his family and friends, as it would result in his physical death. He acknowledges that this is only the beginning of his spiritual exploration.
</li><li><b>Contemplating the Essence of Reality</b>: Leo intensely questions the ultimate essence of reality, leading to his consciousness becoming more omniscient, interconnected, and ultimately forming a singularity of pure love.
</li><li><b>Analogy of Infinite Consciousness</b>: He compares his increasing consciousness to a light bulb being dialed up, becoming brighter and infinitely more conscious, indicating a continuous expansion without an endpoint.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Infinite Subdivision</b>: Leo describes consciousness as infinitely subdividing, immediately spawning an endless number of branches in all directions, symbolizing the endless fractal nature of awareness and its interconnectedness.
</li><li><b>Realization of God as Love</b>: Through this experience, he faces an oscillating inner dialogue about the nature of God, ultimately realizing, despite resistance, that reality is infinite love.
</li><li><b>The End of Individual Existence</b>: Confronted with fear, Leo understands that fully embracing this singularity of consciousness would mean the end of individual life and the physical universe as he knows it, merging into oneness with all existence.
</li><li><b>Awakening as the End and Beginning</b>: He recognizes that awakening to this pure love is both an end–death to the ego and personal identity–and a beginning–entry into an infinite state of being that is the true nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Struggle with the Finality of Transformation</b>: Leo grapples with the idea of completely transcending physical existence and the impact it would have on his loved ones, recognizing both the irrelevance in the face of infinite love and his struggle to accept this finality.
</li><li><b>Preview of Ultimate Awakening</b>: He shares that his experience gave him a preview of Maha Samadhi–dying while awake–and the commitment it entails, ultimately deciding he wasn't ready to merge with this infinite consciousness permanently yet. 
</li><li><b>Ongoing and Intense Experiences</b>: After ceasing the use of 5–MeO–DMT, Leo continues to undergo profound and terrifying insights and awakenings, struggling with the irresistible pull toward the infinite singularity and the fear of losing his individual existence.
</li><li><b>Multidimensional Nature of Awakening</b>: Leo describes awakening not just as a single event but as having multiple, unimaginable dimensions, each one deeper and more expansive, hinting at an infinite potential for spiritual exploration and discovery.
</li><li><b>Continuing Exploration of Awakening</b>: Leo shares that he has only begun to explore the "second dimension of awakening" and recognizes that this journey into awakening appears to be infinite, causing him a great deal of fear and emotional upheaval.
</li><li><b>Struggles with Integration</b>: After the retreat, Leo spent several weeks dealing with sleeplessness and emotional turmoil as he attempted to integrate and comprehend the profound experiences and insights from his 30–day psychedelic journey.
</li><li><b>Uncertainty about Permanent Awakening</b>: Leo expresses uncertainty about whether it's possible to stabilize these heightened states of consciousness (like Maha Samadhi) permanently and questions what happens post–Maha Samadhi, such as reincarnation or transitioning to another dimension.
</li><li><b>Humbling Experiences</b>: These experiences have humbled Leo and made him question the depth of understanding that other enlightened teachers or masters possess about reality.
</li><li><b>Leon's Insight about Awakening</b>: He insists that the distinction between permanent and impermanent consciousness is an arbitrary human imposition, and experiencing infinite God consciousness, even if just for a second, is as real as a more prolonged experience.
</li><li><b>Integration and Teaching</b>: Leo contemplates how to achieve these profound states of consciousness naturally, without psychedelics, and reflects on the authenticity and effectiveness of his teachings, considering the notion that when fully awakened, there would be no one else to teach because everyone would be understood as one.
</li><li><b>Shift in Teaching Focus</b>: He anticipates a probable shift in his teaching style toward being more compassionate and loving, playing fewer "games," and placing a stronger emphasis on teaching love.
</li><li><b>Defining Reality</b>: Leo concludes that the most significant insight from his experience is that reality is love, and he hopes to witness others come to this realization–that they, too, are love.
</li><li><b>Re–evaluation of Teaching</b>: After his exploration, he has been re–evaluating not just his teaching methods but also whether he should continue to teach at all, given the realization that ultimately, he is only teaching himself.
</li><li><b>Advising Critical Thinking</b>: Despite sharing profound insights, Leo cautions against turning his teachings into an ideology, advocating for open–mindedness and an individual approach to the spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Openness to Diverse Spiritual Paths</b>: He recognizes that his path may not directly apply to others, as everyone's journey, including the use of psychedelics, traumas, and emotional challenges, is different.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Depth of Awakening</b>: Leo encourages listeners to consider that their awakening may not be complete, and there might be deeper levels of truth to discover. He emphasizes the importance of a continual search for truth regardless of where it may lead.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Incomplete Transformation</b>: Leo admits that while he has experienced profound awakenings, he has not reached the pinnacle of understanding or completed his personal healing journey. He still deals with his own physical and health issues.
