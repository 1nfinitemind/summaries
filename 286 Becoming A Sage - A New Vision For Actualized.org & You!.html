        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/z2wNbLO02Wg' target='_blank'>Becoming A Sage - A New Vision For Actualized.org & You!</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Leo's Personal Evolution</strong> : As Leo has developed and learned more about life and its various facets such as psychology, business, politics, and culture, his vision for Actualized.org has similarly evolved towards helping others and himself become sages. </li>
<li><strong>Best Life for a Human Being</strong> : Leo argues that after extensive research, he believes the best life one can live is that of a sage, surpassing other forms of success and fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Limited Exposure to Sagehood</strong> : He notes that most people are not exposed to the notion of becoming a sage, especially not as children, which he sees as a missed opportunity for guiding one towards an incredibly fulfilling life path. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as 'Sage University'</strong> : Leo's goal is to transform Actualized.org into a repository of knowledge&mdash;akin to a university&mdash;for those seeking sagehood, providing resources, techniques, and guidance to fulfill this lofty ambition. </li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Defining Sagehood</strong> : There is no clear, step-by-step guide to becoming a sage, which Leo finds intriguing and challenging, and he is motivated to document this journey and share it with others. </li>
<li><strong>The Value of Sagehood</strong> : Leo emphasizes the profound inner reward of becoming a sage and is committed to documenting and sharing the various models, frameworks, and techniques necessary for such a transformation. </li>
<li><strong>History's Great Sages</strong> : He lists several historical and modern sages such as Buddha, Socrates, Gandhi, Osho, and Sadhguru. Leo encourages his audience to study these figures to understand their lives and the qualities that differentiate them from average individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Inner Qualities of a Sage</strong> : The essence that makes sages 'great' according to Leo is not their external achievements but their internal self-mastery and inner transformation, which is evident in their unique way of relating to others and perceiving the world. </li>
<li><strong>Sagehood Overlooked and Misunderstood</strong> : He laments that sagehood is not taught or discussed widely in society and that when it is, it&rsquo;s often distorted by the ego-driven interpretations found in certain religious teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Meeting Modern Sages</strong> : Leo expresses his profound admiration for modern sages he has met in person, highlighting the transformative potential of interacting with someone who embodies sage-like qualities, and questions why such a valuable life option is not more widely shared or understood. </li>
<li><strong>Key Qualities of Sages</strong> : Sages exhibit a commitment to Truth, consciousness, goodness, and love along with a deep, effortless embodiment of these qualities after radical inward transformation. </li>
<li><strong>Sage vs. Enlightenment</strong> : There is a distinction between merely having enlightenment experiences and being a sage. Being a sage involves a mastery that goes beyond the experience of enlightenment itself. </li>
<li><strong>Modern Mystic Sage Vision</strong> : Leo desires for individuals to progress towards becoming 'modern mystic sages'&mdash;a composite of Eastern non-duality and Western philosophy, science, and art&mdash;creating individuals who engage in the world with consciousness and deep conceptual understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Being in the World as a Sage</strong> : Unlike ascetics, modern sages apply their self-mastery and understanding to solving real-world problems, utilizing their enhanced creativity and productivity. </li>
<li><strong>What a Sage is Not</strong> : A true sage is not a detached intellectual lacking self-awareness or emotional mastery, nor an ideological crusader interested in converting others to their worldview without inward focus. </li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Vision in Becoming a Sage</strong> : The vision of becoming a sage is more significant than knowing the precise steps. A strong, motivating vision propels individuals forward, while a weak vision leads to seeking reassurance and formulaic paths. </li>
<li><strong>The 'How' of Becoming a Sage</strong> : While specific steps vary, the process includes setting truth as the top value, rejecting materialism, performing a spiritual purification process of body, mind, emotions, and habits, and developing a strong 'energy body' to manage emotions effectively. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional Resilience of a Sage</strong> : Sages experience deeply but have the ability to transmute negative emotions, such as hurt and tragedy, into love and truth due to a strong energy body. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity for Extensive Theoretical Learning</strong> : Despite common misunderstandings, becoming a sage requires a robust theoretical foundation which includes studying philosophy, psychology, history, and other fields to understand the sage path. </li>
<li><strong>Seeking Uncommon Knowledge</strong> : A sage must sift through vast amounts of information to find valuable insights that further their mastery, as exemplified by Leo's own extensive research and learning process. </li>
<li><strong>Application of Knowledge</strong> : The knowledge acquired is not for mere intellectual accumulation but for practical application in self-mastery and raising consciousness, differentiating a sage from an academic. </li>
<li><strong>Raising Awareness through Practice</strong> : Regular meditation, contemplation, self-inquiry, and understanding the nature of life, truth, falsehood, and society are crucial practices for a sage to raise awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Exploring Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness</strong> : Engaging in activities like meditation, breathwork, and the use of psychedelics helps a sage go beyond the ordinary level of consciousness and gain deeper insights. </li>
<li><strong>Creativity as a Sage Attribute</strong> : Sages should explore and express their creativity, using their knowledge for positive real-world impact, as guided in Leo's Life Purpose Course. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Big-Picture Understanding</strong> : The universal and compassionate perspective that emphasizes love for humanity and a broad understanding of life distinguishes sages from specialists in academic or scientific fields. </li>
<li><strong>Unconditional Love and Compassion</strong> : A true sage develops deep, indiscriminate love and compassion for all of reality, transcending the newbie trap of indifference due to the illusory nature of life. </li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Collective Consciousness</strong> : Helping others raise their awareness is seen as part of a sage's purpose, through various domains like technology, art, and science, to address the lack of consciousness in different fields. </li>
<li><strong>Selective Path of the Sage</strong> : Although becoming a sage may not be for everyone, those who are called to it will find fulfilling content on Actualized.org and opportunities to engage in transformative work. </li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing between Life Purpose and Sagehood</strong> : Leo addresses that becoming a sage is compatible with having a life purpose, as both relate to the journey of self-mastery and should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. </li>
<li><strong>Vision and Excitement for Sagehood</strong> : The path of becoming a sage is specialized and requires a profound desire and excitement from the individual; it's not represented in mainstream society despite its significance. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement and Feedback Request</strong> : Leo invites audience feedback on the vision of becoming a sage to inform the direction of future content on Actualized.org and encourages signing up for the newsletter for further insights. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of Enlightenment and Life Purpose</strong> : Enlightenment may reveal life as an illusion without inherent purpose, yet historical figures like Buddha, Jesus, and Gandhi, who were deeply enlightened, were also driven by a strong sense of life purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Reconciling Career and Personal Purpose</strong> : Leo distinguishes between career purpose, as guided by the Life Purpose Course, and personal purpose, which is the overarching aim of becoming a sage and pursuing self-mastery, regardless of one's professional work. </li>
<li><strong>Illusion as Motivation</strong> : Although enlightenment exposes life's illusory nature, having a purpose created by oneself can serve as a motivator. The desire to create and enjoy a purpose is sufficient reason to do so, despite it being a construction. </li>
<li><strong>Seriousness in Spiritual Practice</strong> : Leo stresses that the pursuit of sagehood and mastery of consciousness must be taken seriously, akin to mystics of the past. Temporary objectives can motivate and inspire on this path, countering the risk of spiritual stagnation. </li>
<li><strong>Content Direction for Actualized.org</strong> : Future content will delve into deeper, meta, and philosophical topics, with an emphasis on understanding over success. A longer time horizon is required of viewers, as these subjects demand individual initiative and application to one's life. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Big-Picture Thinking</strong> : The forthcoming content aims to integrate diverse perspectives from various fields, fostering big-picture thinking and a historical understanding of personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Journey of Actualized.org</strong> : The envisioned direction for Actualized.org is to support viewers in becoming sages, which Leo deems a purposeful life dedication. Audience engagement and feedback will be essential in shaping this direction. </li>
<li><strong>Invitation to Join the Journey</strong> : Leo invites viewers to sign up for Actualized.org's newsletter for more insights on becoming a sage and encourages them to share their thoughts on embracing this vision for personal transformation.</li>
