    <li><b>End of day three meditation routine</b>: Leo completed an exhaustive meditation routine, totaling over 10 hours, which included diverse methods such as labeling, concentration, walking meditation, "do nothing," and a newly created practice called "just sitting and being conscious."
</li><li><b>Fatigue and mechanical practice</b>: Leo reports increasing exhaustion towards the end of his sessions and recognizes a struggle against becoming mechanical in his meditation practices, prompting innovation in his approach.
</li><li><b>Designing a personalized retreat schedule</b>: Leo has tailored his retreat schedule to align with his natural sleep patterns, waking late and meditating until the early hours to ensure quality and alertness during sessions.
