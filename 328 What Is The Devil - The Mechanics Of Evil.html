            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/rVcxIamwO5g' target='_blank'>What Is The Devil - The Mechanics Of Evil</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Warning Issued About Content</b>: Leo Gura starts with a warning that the content may offend or disturb, alluding to past experiences of receiving death threats for discussing similar material. The episode aims to penetrate the core of the ego, which could be uncomfortable yet potentially rewarding in terms of personal growth.
</li><li><b>Reconciling Evil</b>: Leo intends to help his audience understand and reconcile with the existence of evil, addressing age–old questions about the nature, existence, and mechanics of evil, as well as the paradox of a benevolent God allowing evil, and ultimately how to stop evil.
</li><li><b>The Devil as the Self</b>: Leo asserts that the devil is a metaphorical representation of one's own ego or self, not an external creature with horns. Evil is equated to selfishness, ignorance, and unconsciousness, with the self coming into being through deception, including self–deception.
</li><li><b>Creation of the Self</b>: Explains that the self is not a physical object but a conceptual creation that arises from the perceived distinction between self and other. Reality lacks such distinctions; they are artificially constructed, and maintaining these boundaries is what sustains the concept of self.
</li><li><b>Self–Preservation and Boundaries</b>: The self's entire existence relies on preserving the demarcation between self and other. Leo likens the self to a water balloon that is trying to avoid being punctured by external threats, noting how this defensive stance is a natural behavior for survival.
</li><li><b>Relative Nature of Evil</b>: The concept of evil is a tool created by the self to marginalize and justify eliminating threats without self–reflection or guilt. The notion of evil is thus entirely relative to one's self–preservation, with no inherent existence absent a self.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Own Devilish Nature</b>: Leo urges recognizing the devil within oneself, understanding the deceptive nature of the self, acknowledging one's own selfish actions, and comprehending the depth of this force to appreciate why others may act in harmful ways.
</li><li><b>Selfishness and Its Double Standards</b>: Highlights the hypocrisy in how quickly one points out others' selfish actions as evil, while excusing or ignoring their own selfish behaviors, demonstrating the self–serving bias that perpetuates evil.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Perception</b>: Leo emphasizes that concepts like slavery, torture, or genocide are not evil in an absolute sense; they are considered evil relative to who perceives them as a threat. He challenges the common notion that certain groups, such as Nazis or terrorists, are absolutely evil, arguing their evilness is subjective.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Evil and Cultural Perspectives</b>: Different cultures view evil based on what contradicts their cherished values. Nazis and terrorists are not seen as evil by their supporters but by those whose values they threat. The concept of evil shifts with perspectives and agendas, not intrinsic characteristics.
</li><li><b>Self–Bias as a Universal Human Behavior</b>: Nearly everyone operates with self–bias, aiming to fulfill their own agendas. This self–serving behavior is common across humanity and is a key contributor to the perpetuation of harm and evil in the world.
</li><li><b>Denial of Personal Evil Acts</b>: Individuals often deny their daily participation in evil acts due to ignorance. Leo emphasizes that acknowledging these acts is critical since evil, fundamentally, stems from ignorance.
</li><li><b>Evil and the Perception of Goodness</b>: The ego or self maintains its existence by perceiving itself as good, creating distinctions between 'us' and 'them' to justify its actions and avoid taking responsibility for the harm caused.
</li><li><b>Invisible Collateral Damage and Evil</b>: Most evil acts occur not due to sinister intentions but through ignorance and denial. A prime example is the Iraq War, where the public was unaware or ignored the significant number of civilian casualties caused by their government's actions, enabled by taxpayer's money.
</li><li><b>Consumer Responsibility in Evil</b>: Consumers indirectly support harmful systems through their purchases, such as smartphones made under poor labor conditions. These actions, though often overlooked, are driven by ignorance and selfishness.
</li><li><b>Function of Evil and Self–Deception</b>: Evil is a concept created by the ego to protect itself by labeling others as bad, preventing empathy and self–reflection, allowing harm to be inflicted guilt–free.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Labeling as Evil</b>: Individuals and entities commonly labeled as evil (e.g., Hitler, dictators, racists) do not perceive themselves as such due to the self's mechanism to protect its own actions and avoid seeing itself as the 'other'.
</li><li><b>Mechanism of Evil as Self–Defense</b>: The idea of evil is used by the self to justify actions against others viewed as threats, ensuring that the ego survives by projecting evil onto the 'other' while avoiding self–contemplation. 
</li><li><b>Attributes of the Devil and Resistance to Truth</b>: The devil, as a metaphorical symbol of evil, employs deceit and avoids self–reflection. Truth, seen as a threat to the devil's existence, is evaded to maintain self–identity and avoid the realization of non–self.
</li><li><b>Devil's Alignment with Falsehood over Truth</b>: The devil, upon emergence, inverts values to survive–designating truth as falsehood and vice versa. Absolute truth symbolizes God, which is boundless and infinite, leaving no room for the limited self or the devil.
</li><li><b>Subversion of Spirituality</b>: Leo criticizes the way religion often corrupts true spirituality, turning a path to truth into a system reinforcing ignorance. He explains how religious institutions, which should align with spirituality, end up doing the opposite by deepening the self's ignorance, thus doing the work of the 'devil'.
</li><li><b>Devil's Existential Threat</b>: For the devil, true spirituality presents an existential threat as it leads to the truth and the potential eradication of the devil. Leo describes how the devil subverts this threat by corrupting spirituality and using it to amplify its own survival.
</li><li><b>Ideology as Devilry</b>: Leo identifies ideology – whether it's religious, political, economic, or scientific – as a tool of the devil for creating identity and reinforcing separation. Ideology is considered devilry because it promotes a false sense of truth and superiority.
</li><li><b>Arrogance of the Devil</b>: The devil is described as massively arrogant, believing it possesses the ultimate truth which justifies preaching, converting, and sometimes harming those who do not accept this 'truth'. This arrogance serves the devil's survival by maintaining the illusion of separation from God.
</li><li><b>Outward Materialistic Orientation</b>: Leo points out that the devil never self–reflects because doing so would mean its demise. Instead, it maintains an outward materialistic focus on sensual pleasures and distractions to avoid facing the truth of its non–existence.
</li><li><b>Devil's Inevitable Loss</b>: He emphasizes that despite the devil's cunningness, it is doomed to fail eventually because truth overpowers falsehood. The devil's survival game is temporary and its strategies ultimately futile.
</li><li><b>Devil's Perception of Separation from God</b>: The devil's fundamental deception is thinking that it is separate from God; maintaining this separation requires constant lies and self–deception. Leo clarifies that from God's perspective, there is no separation, implying that the devil is also an aspect of God.
</li><li><b>Neurotic Self–Reflection of the Devil</b>: The devil does engage in self–reflection to some degree, but it is neurotic and characterized by shame, guilt, and self–hatred, which serve as distractions from true self–awareness.
</li><li><b>God's Inclusion of Evil and Boundaries</b>: Leo resolves the question of why a benevolent God allows evil by stating that God includes everything, even evil, within its infinite nature. Boundaries and separation are part of God's creation, including those that define the self, revealing that the perceptions of good and evil are also aspects of divinity.
</li><li><b>Non–duality of God and the Devil</b>: He concludes by highlighting the non–dualistic nature of reality, where good and evil, God and the devil, are not dichotomous opposites but rather different expressions of the same underlying oneness.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Evil Within</b>: Admitting one's own capacity for being the 'devil' is crucial as it instigates introspection and personal change, moving beyond the mere projection of evil onto others.
</li><li><b>Creating Evil by Labeling it</b>: Leo points out that the act of labeling something as evil is in itself a creation of evil because evil is a conceptual projection that becomes real when people assign it to others.
</li><li><b>Non–Duality and the Notion of Evil</b>: Since everything is interconnected and non–dual, labeling anything as evil is essentially labeling oneself, rendering the concept meaningless and unproductive.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Product of Defense Mechanisms</b>: The traditional response to evil–attempting to stop it–ironically gives rise to more evil, as seen in wartime propaganda demonizing the enemy to rationalize violence.
</li><li><b>Understanding Mechanisms Behind Fear and Evil</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of grasping the dynamics of fear, self–preservation, and collective survival which lead to labeling others as evil without self–reflection.
</li><li><b>Survival versus Truth</b>: The struggle between prioritizing survival or truth can lead to self–deception. An ego–based perspective cares only about survival, often compromising truth and perpetuating the cycle of evil.
</li><li><b>Selfish Nature of Wanting to End Evil</b>: The desire to combat evil often stems from our own selfishness and survival instincts rather than a genuine commitment to truth or consciousness.
</li><li><b>Combatting Evil Through Self–Reflection</b>: To ethically engage with the concept of evil, one should acknowledge personal capacity for harmful actions and commit to higher priorities of truth and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Ego Death in Pursuit of Truth</b>: Embracing truth may result in the figurative 'death' of the ego, but this process is necessary for the enlightenment and elimination of evil as a deceptive projection.
</li><li><b>Reality Post–Ego Death</b>: Awakening to the reality of non–self (enlightenment) enables a person to see evil as a mental construct rather than an external truth, thus redeeming the 'devil' within.
</li><li><b>Physical Harm After Eliminating Evil</b>: Leo clarifies that addressing the conceptual nature of evil doesn't guarantee physical safety, but rather it's about stopping the perpetuation and projection of evil.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Conceptual versus Physical Problem</b>: The ultimate resolution of evil is to cease projecting it as a concept, which involves a significant shift in consciousness, rather than preventing physical acts often labeled as evil.
</li><li><b>Ineffectiveness of Combating Violence with Violence</b>: Leo emphasizes that historically, responding to violence with more violence has perpetuated its existence, suggesting that understanding violence and not being defensive are more effective approaches.
</li><li><b>Disidentification with Material Self</b>: The key to not being disturbed by violence, according to Leo, lies in disidentifying with one's physical body and material possessions, recognizing their temporality, and acknowledging one's true self beyond the physical.
</li><li><b>Conceptual vs. Physical Problem of Evil</b>: Leo argues that the problem of evil is conceptual rather than physical, and advises listeners to transcend material attachments to solve it.
</li><li><b>Imagination Exercise to Understand Evil</b>: Leo recommends an exercise that involves imagining oneself in the place of various beings who have suffered, to foster empathy and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life.
</li><li><b>Perception of Reality from God's Perspective</b>: By considering life from the universal or God's perspective, one can see themselves inhabiting every life form, and this can alter one's behavior by highlighting the unity of existence.
</li><li><b>Impact of Conscious Awareness on Behavior</b>: Leo suggests that when one is truly conscious of the interconnectedness of all beings, naturally, one would avoid inflicting unnecessary suffering on others, which is the essence of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Non–Duality and the Illusion of Separateness</b>: Realizing non–duality, which reveals no boundaries between self and others, allows one to understand that all perceptions of separate identity are illusions.
</li><li><b>Selfishness and Devilry in Acting Good Prematurely</b>: Attempting to act 'good' without genuinely feeling interconnected with all beings can lead to more harm and is described by Leo as the devil thinking.
</li><li><b>The Difficulty of Exorcising the Self</b>: Understanding why evil persists involves recognizing the challenge of overcoming one's own selfish tendencies and exhibiting empathy towards others facing similar struggles.
</li><li><b>Unconditional Love and Rejection of Notions of Evil</b>: Leo insists that if one desires absolute love and tranquility, they must surrender all concepts of evil, as enlightenment means no longer having the right to criticize or condemn others' actions.
</li><li><b>Criticizing and Surrendering to Non–Duality</b>: Surrendering the compulsion to criticize others is a requirement for higher consciousness, and failure to do so perpetuates the problem of evil.
