            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/v1yA9KbPzQ0' target='_blank'>How To Harness Your Intuition</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Self–Actualization and Intuition</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of intuition in self–actualization, stating that it serves as a life compass. However, he notes that many people are disconnected from their intuition, leading to a life lacking in motivation, purpose, and strategic vision.
</li><li><b>Western Culture's Bias Against Intuition</b>: He criticizes Western culture's preference for logic, explaining that it teaches people to dismiss intuition. This is evident in situations like corporate decisions, where logical justifications are demanded over intuitive feelings. Nonetheless, intuitive decisions play a critical role in our lives.
</li><li><b>The Superiority of Intuition Over Logic</b>: Leo points out that intuition is the source of purpose and vision, necessary for creating the big picture that logical thinking then details. He argues that the subconscious mind can process vast amounts of data, providing valuable wisdom and creative insights beyond the capability of linear, logical thinking.
</li><li><b>The Human Subconscious as a Supercomputer</b>: Intuition stems from the complex workings of the subconscious mind, which Leo describes as a distributed network capable of handling information in ways the logical mind cannot. He encourages embracing this higher order intelligence over the limited, linear thinking common in the left–brain–dominated Western culture.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Intuition Experiences</b>: Leo shares his personal history, describing how his intuition has led him to take harder classes, change majors, quit jobs, and ultimately start Actualized.org. He credits intuition with his significant life decisions and personal growth, emphasizing its ongoing influence in guiding his choices.
</li><li><b>Difficulties of Following Intuition</b>: He highlights three major barriers to following intuition: the inability to hear it, personal impurities that obstruct its guidance, and the failure to act on it even when it is heard. Leo stresses these challenges and underscores the need to address them for successful intuitive living.
</li><li><b>Cultural Reasons for Not Hearing Intuition</b>: Leo identifies cultural distractions and the Western bias for logic and materialism as reasons people fail to hear their intuitive voice. He advocates for reducing distractions and considering one's mortality to create space for intuition.
</li><li><b>True Intelligence and Its Source</b>: Leo encourages acknowledging that true intelligence is interwoven with existence, not generated by the individual. He suggests that higher consciousness work, meditation, and perhaps psychedelics can reveal the depth and external sources of intelligence that exist beyond our analytical minds.
</li><li><b>Solutions for Hearing Intuition</b>: To hear the intuitive voice, Leo advises removing distractions and contemplating mortality to shift focus from materialism to profound insights. He also mentions the episode on lifestyle minimalism as a resource for creating conditions conducive to intuition.
</li><li><b>Contemplation of Mortality</b>: Realizing that life is fleeting shifts focus from materialism to deeper life pursuits. Contemplating death allows intuition to emerge, directing focus on more meaningful goals.
</li><li><b>Clarifying Life Desires</b>: Understanding what one truly desires in life, beyond superficial aims like success and money, is key to harnessing intuition.
</li><li><b>Meditation for Intuition</b>: Regular meditation fosters stillness and solitude, enhancing intuition and making one more receptive to its subtle guidance.
</li><li><b>Connection with Emotions</b>: Engaging in activities that promote emotional awareness, like yoga or meditation, can help one feel and follow their intuition more effectively.
</li><li><b>Impurities Blocking Intuition</b>: Ego, cravings, fears, traumas, and dogmas distort intuition. The ego can manipulate intuition for low–consciousness purposes.
</li><li><b>Benevolent Motives and Spiritual Purification</b>: Intuitions should come from a place of love and beauty. Purifying one's identity of fears and cravings allows intuition to serve as a guide.
</li><li><b>Releasing Beliefs</b>: Letting go of limiting beliefs, including those surrounding intuition, grants freedom to pursue intuitive guidance without self–imposed constraints.
</li><li><b>Changing Environment</b>: Modifying one's surroundings and controlling information intake can reduce impurities that cloud intuition.
</li><li><b>Healthy Relationships and Bodily Tension</b>: Ending toxic relationships and releasing physical tension allows for a clearer intuitive understanding.
</li><li><b>Serving Intuition as Life's Mission</b>: Recognizing the importance of intuitively guided actions encourages commitment and flexibility to enact meaningful life changes determined by intuition.
</li><li><b>The Intuition Incubator Concept</b>: Cultivating intuitions through dedicated contemplation and action allows for personal growth and transformation. 
</li><li><b>Commitment and Flexibility for Intuitive Action</b>: Real change requires a serious commitment to follow intuitions and a willingness to learn, grow, and make uncomfortable changes.
</li><li><b>Courage to Act on Intuition</b>: Following intuition can involve radical, sometimes frightening changes, such as career shifts or ending long–term endeavors, demanding a significant courage investment.
</li><li><b>Intuition Incubator</b>: An intuition incubator allows one to nurture and develop intuitions which initially appear in an unpolished form, requiring time and effort to be transformed into actionable insights.
</li><li><b>Journaling and Articulation</b>: Leo recommends journaling as a tool to catalog and clearly articulate intuitions, promoting a deeper understanding and facilitating the creation of strategic plans for action.
</li><li><b>Strategic Long–term Commitment</b>: Persistence and a long–term view are crucial for realizing intuitions. Leo shares his personal journey, where his intuitions about his life purpose took years to materialize, demonstrating the importance of strategic long–term planning and commitment.
</li><li><b>Service to Intuition</b>: Leo emphasizes that one's primary life mission should be serving their intuitions, which may necessitate stepping out of comfort zones and making significant changes.
</li><li><b>True vs. False Intuitions</b>: True intuitions do not defend themselves with justifications when questioned and have a magnetic pull, whereas false intuitions are often protective, fear–based, and seek to rationalize themselves.
</li><li><b>Surrender to Universal Intelligence</b>: Leo advises surrendering to a pervasive intelligence that guides life decisions, encouraging the acceptance of this force to lead a purpose–driven and aspirational life.
</li><li><b>Employee of the Universe</b>: By acting as an 'employee of the universe', one aligns with a more significant force, thus finding powerful motivation and fulfillment in actions that go beyond personal gain.
</li><li><b>Practical Worksheet</b>: Leo provides a worksheet with practical questions to assist in developing intuitions, which can be downloaded from actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Personal Development Journey</b>: He highlights the importance of continued learning and taking action based on his teachings for personal growth, inviting the audience to explore the potential of self–actualization through ongoing engagement with actualized.org.
