            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/M-6FxH_p5_k' target='_blank'>Life Purpose - Critical Points For Finding Your Life Purpose</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Exploration of Life Purpose</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of life purpose, questioning whether one lives a life driven by deeper principles or just follows a day-to-day routine. He stresses that a life purpose gives individuals grounding, direction, and helps them achieve success whether it's financial, reputational, or in relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Fulfillment Through Alignment with Deep Values</strong> : The sense of fulfillment and the avoidance of feeling lost are tied to having a life purpose that aligns one&#39;s job with their deepest values. Without this purpose, individuals risk feeling unfulfilled and adrift. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose as an Evolving Onion</strong> : Leo likens the discovery of one's life purpose to peeling an onion, suggesting it's a multi-layered exploration rather than a static definition. As people peel away layers, they delve deeper into their intuition and desires, redefining their purpose over time. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose and Career Interconnected</strong> : Much of one&#39;s life is spent working, making it crucial for one&#39;s career to be deeply fulfilling and aligned with their higher purpose. Leo views a career not just as a job, but as a significant portion of life that should reflect one's core values. </li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Process of Finding Life Purpose</strong> : Life purpose is portrayed as dynamic, constantly evolving as individuals go deeper into understanding themselves. This process can start anywhere, from discovering the kind of impact one wants to make to aligning with one&#39;s deepest values and potential. </li>
<li><strong>Transitioning for Purposeful Expression</strong> : Leo advises that people may need to transition to different jobs or start their own venture to fully express themselves and their purpose. This may involve shifting to a company whose values align more closely with one's own or finding a new way to utilize existing skills to better serve their evolving purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Values and Authentic Self-Expression</strong> : Discovering life purpose is essentially about finding ways to authentically express oneself through work. This process requires identifying one's core values and experimenting with different means to manifest these values in the professional world. </li>
<li><strong>Aligning with Life Purpose Requires Courage and Action</strong> : Leo shares his personal experience where he had to leave a comfortable job to start his own business, an internet marketing venture, to fund his game development aspirations. This decision highlighted the challenges of aligning life&#39;s work with personal values and the courage it takes to make such a shift. </li>
<li><strong>Reassessment and Realignment</strong> : Finding one's purpose can involve reassessment and realignment, as was the case with Leo when he realized internet marketing did not resonate with him. It requires consideration of how to create value for others, generate income, and achieve expressive freedom in one's work. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Designing Life Around Purpose</strong> : Designing a life around one&#39;s purpose is emphasized as challenging yet crucial. Without a clear purpose, life can become aimless, underscoring the importance of setting long-term goals to prevent living a life of trivial motivations. </li>
<li><strong>Concrete Objectives and Life Impact</strong> : Having clear objectives and desired impact in work is critical; without them, one may simply chase superficial rewards, leading to a lack of true self-expression and a passionate engagement with work. </li>
<li><strong>Planning and Introspection for Life Purpose</strong> : The process of finding one&#39;s life purpose requires long-term planning and introspection, which can prevent a life of mediocrity and aimlessness. </li>
<li><strong>Intentional and Dedicated Effort for Impact</strong> : To have a significant impact, it is necessary to be intentional and dedicated to your life purpose, as accidental achievement of profound influence is unlikely. </li>
<li><strong>Dynamic and Evolving Purpose</strong> : Life purpose is not static but evolves continually; Leo's current purpose involves personal development coaching, but the specific manifestation of that purpose can change. </li>
<li><strong>Discovery through Action and Experience</strong> : Understanding one's purpose comes from actively engaging in different activities and reflecting on the experiences to see what resonates and what does not. </li>
<li><strong>Questions to Guide Purpose Discovery</strong> : To start finding one&#39;s purpose, it is helpful to ask what one would do if money weren't a concern, the impact one wants to have, the legacy to leave behind, and what accomplishments bring pride. </li>
<li><strong>Creating Value Over Material Goals</strong> : Shifting focus from materialistic goals to creating value for others leads to greater fulfillment; meaningful lives are built on contribution and influence, not just personal gains. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose as an Ongoing Quest</strong> : The quest for life purpose is a personal journey that can encompass a wide variety of experiences and changes, and it may require shifting away from the assumption that purpose is inborn. </li>
<li><strong>Immediate Purpose of Finding Purpose</strong> : If no clear life purpose is evident, Leo suggests making the immediate purpose to find your life purpose, engaging in exploration, and being open to iterative learning and course corrections.</li>
