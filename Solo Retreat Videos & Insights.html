            <ul>
    <li><b>End of setup day reflections</b>: Leo acknowledges the setup took longer than expected, with significant effort required not just for logistics but also for establishing ground rules for the retreat's duration.
</li><li><b>Daily practice structure</b>: He plans to implement strict mindfulness meditation using Shinzen Young's labeling technique as a foundation, followed by self–inquiry and other practices in ten one–hour blocks each day.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness continuity</b>: The challenge is to maintain mindfulness 24/7, even during breaks and non–formal activities, applying the labeling technique consistently to stay present.
</li><li><b>Retreat emotional phases</b>: Anticipates beginning, middle, and end phases of the retreat with difficulties such as adjustment to routine change, emotional upheavals, and physical fatigue, especially coupled with practical responsibilities like meal prep.
</li><li><b>Rules and commitment</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of self–imposed rules and a firm commitment to staying disconnected from technology and resisting the urge to give in to distractions and temptations.
</li><li><b>Sleep strategy</b>: Adopts a pragmatic approach to sleepiness during meditation by taking short naps to reset alertness and maximize following meditation sessions' efficacy.
</li><li><b>Documentation discipline</b>: Plans to limit documentation to 10–minute video sessions each night, culminating in a final wrap–up to share insights and highlight the practicalities and challenges experienced.
</li><li><b>Confronting and transforming through adversity</b>: Stresses the necessity to face tough emotional experiences as part of the spiritual purification process, recognizing them as pivotal transformative work where the ego is diminished.
</li><li><b>Personal experiment and transparency</b>: Leo concludes with a reflection on the experiment's raw nature, opening up the possibility of sharing more if it proves valuable to others.
