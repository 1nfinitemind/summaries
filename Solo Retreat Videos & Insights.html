            <ul>
<li><strong>End of setup day reflections</strong> : Leo acknowledges the setup took longer than expected, with significant effort required not just for logistics but also for establishing ground rules for the retreat's duration.</li>
<li><strong>Daily practice structure</strong> : He plans to implement strict mindfulness meditation using Shinzen Young's labeling technique as a foundation, followed by self-inquiry and other practices in ten one-hour blocks each day.</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness continuity</strong> : The challenge is to maintain mindfulness 24/7, even during breaks and non-formal activities, applying the labeling technique consistently to stay present.</li>
<li><strong>Retreat emotional phases</strong> : Anticipates beginning, middle, and end phases of the retreat with difficulties such as adjustment to routine change, emotional upheavals, and physical fatigue, especially coupled with practical responsibilities like meal prep.</li>
<li><strong>Rules and commitment</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of self-imposed rules and a firm commitment to staying disconnected from technology and resisting the urge to give in to distractions and temptations.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep strategy</strong> : Adopts a pragmatic approach to sleepiness during meditation by taking short naps to reset alertness and maximize following meditation sessions' efficacy.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation discipline</strong> : Plans to limit documentation to 10-minute video sessions each night, culminating in a final wrap-up to share insights and highlight the practicalities and challenges experienced.</li>
<li><strong>Confronting and transforming through adversity</strong> : Stresses the necessity to face tough emotional experiences as part of the spiritual purification process, recognizing them as pivotal transformative work where the ego is diminished.</li>
<li><strong>Personal experiment and transparency</strong> : Leo concludes with a reflection on the experiment's raw nature, opening up the possibility of sharing more if it proves valuable to others.</li>
