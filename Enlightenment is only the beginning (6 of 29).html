        <ul>
<li><strong>Perpetual quest for truth</strong> : Entering the realm of contemplative practice opens possibilities for discovering truth, and while one may begin this journey, its ultimate destination remains unknown, offering either limitless insights or none at all. </li>
<li><strong>Kensho as an awakening gateway</strong> : The initial glimpse or Kensho transforms abstract beliefs into direct experience, marking the inception of a profound journey, yet it's just the start with much more to comprehend. </li>
<li><strong>Post-Kensho ignorance</strong> : Even after an awakening to one's true nature, comprehensive knowledge remains elusive. The nature of self, others, and existence continue to be mysterious, challenging the notion that enlightenment immediately bestows universal understanding. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge of post-enlightenment contemplation</strong> : Post-enlightenment doesn't guarantee ease in gaining further insights. The mind tends to reconstruct itself, embroiling consciousness once again in survival tasks, leaving new contemplations as challenging as before the enlightenment experience. </li>
<li><strong>Stages of deeper consciousness</strong> : With each new aspect of reality grasped through contemplation, one's consciousness deepens, recognizing that while distinctions are made in the relative world, they ultimately merge into the same unified consciousness, leading to an ever-expanding inclusiveness.</li>
</ul>
