        <ul>
<li><strong>Preparation and disclaimer for salvia use</strong> : With extensive personal experience in psychedelics, Leo tried a small dose of salvia divinorum, emphasizing the disorienting potency and danger of the substance. Salvia can completely replace one's sense of reality with another, triggering dangerous reactions without any recollection of taking a drug. Leo insists on the importance of a trip sitter and advises against use by inexperienced individuals or without supervision due to the potential for harm.</li>
<li><strong>Unique dissociative effects of salvia</strong> : Unlike other psychedelics that may result in ego death while retaining some biographical memory, salvia can disrupt the entire stream of consciousness, leading to a complete loss of identity and context. Leo's left side of the visual field and cognitive perception became consumed by what he describes as a "roiling infinity," an experience of pure infinite potential that was highly dissociative and unfamiliar when compared to other psychedelic experiences like 5-MeO-DMT 'God Mode'. </li>
<li><strong>Dangers of loss of self and reality</strong> : The visual and self-perception effects induced by salvia triggered a sense of panic and terror in Leo, who managed to remain relatively grounded thanks to an unaffected right side. This asymmetric impact on consciousness raised concerns about the potential for complete detachment from reality and the need for careful monitoring during the experience.</li>
<li><strong>Depth of psychedelic experiences</strong> : Salvia unveiled an even deeper layer of consciousness that traditional psychedelics hadn't reached, opening a new, alien and strange dimension that extends beyond the more predictable experiences of other substances. Multiple uses of salvia highlighted how each trip can uniquely affect consciousness in unpredictable ways.</li>
<li><strong>Ego loss and memory</strong> : Beyond the transformation of the concept of death, salvia experiences led to a deeper understanding of ego loss-challenging the idea of being selfless. A complete loss of self would mean not even knowing basic biographical information, a state that could potentially disorient even those who are spiritually advanced and are supposedly beyond ego.</li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about mental health</strong> : Leo's trips deepened his empathy for mental health challenges. He discusses how easily the brain can tip into a state of disorder, debunking the dismissive attitudes towards mental illness and urging greater compassion and understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity of consciousness work</strong> : Spiritual practice is misrepresented as a linear journey by many teachers. They often lack comprehension of the multi-dimensional aspects of the journey, which can include experiences misinterpreted as mental disorders. Salvia experiences reinforce the view that spiritual work has far more dimensions than commonly portrayed.</li>
<li><strong>Human dependency on a stable consciousness</strong> : The stability of consciousness is vital for everyday human function and survival. The difficulty in transcending this stability underscores both its necessity for living and the challenges of achieving spiritual awakening. The rigid nature of consciousness is both a constraint and a life-preserving mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Reliance on Consistent Consciousness</strong> : Our survival deeply depends on a stable consciousness and a consistent sense of self and memory. Losing these can disconnect us from reality with dangerous consequences; it underlines the paradox of survival and awakening where one cannot simply forsake survival to achieve an awakened state. </li>
<li><strong>Approach to Psychedelic Experimentation</strong> : A cautious and respectful approach is highlighted for exploring psychedelics like salvia. Initial small doses are recommended to gauge sensitivity; a breakthrough dose could result in completely leaving material reality, which may be traumatic and lead to a rejection of future psychedelic use. </li>
<li><strong>Individual Sensitivity Variations</strong> : Sensitivity to psychedelics significantly varies across individuals, making it crucial to personalize dosages through trial and experience. Leo acknowledges being particularly sensitive, experiencing profound effects at lower doses than an average person.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Realities Induced by Salvia</strong> : Salvia can induce experiences that are completely detached from recognizable reality, transforming a person's sense of identity into inanimate or conceptual entities, such as becoming 'one' with a Ferris wheel, or entering chaotic and nonsensical dimensions.</li>
<li><strong>Caution and Respect for Psychedelics</strong> : Treating psychedelics with the same caution as handling dangerous tools is advised, given their potential to radically alter consciousness. Careful research and the use of a trip sitter are emphasized to mitigate the risks associated with psychedelic experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation Against Casual Use of Salvia</strong> : The intense and unpredictable nature of salvia is stressed, with a discouragement from its use for most people. It is suggested that salvia is more suited to highly experienced psychonauts and even then, only with the presence of a trip sitter and a high degree of caution.</li>
