            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/z2B_e24UJi8' target='_blank'>Becoming A Zen Devil - The Dangers Of Half-Assing Enlightenment</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Neo–Advaita Criticism</b>: Leo addresses the Western trend of neo–advaita which simplifies and strips away traditional aspects of non–duality, aiming for a direct path to enlightenment; though innovative, it risks neglecting the complexity and depth found in these ancient teachings.
</li><li><b>Historical Account of Mount Hiei</b>: By recounting the decline of Mount Hiei in Japan, Leo illustrates how a devout non–dual tradition can degenerate into chaos and corruption, highlighting the dangers of misinterpreting and misapplying spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Enlightenment</b>: Leo criticizes the oversimplified view of enlightenment as a single insight with no further growth or practice needed, emphasizing that true enlightenment is a nuanced process that doesn't discard values, principles, or continual self–improvement.
</li><li><b>Zen Devil Phenomenon</b>: He warns against becoming a 'Zen devil', a term for someone who rationalizes ethical neglect and indolence using non–duality, leading to harm and misunderstanding.
</li><li><b>Importance of Discipline and Values</b>: Leo underscores the necessity for maintaining discipline, ethical behavior, personal development, and commitment to excellence in the practice of non–duality, using the strict environment of Zen temples as an example.
</li><li><b>Wisdom Within Tradition</b>: Although Leo acknowledges his distaste for tradition for tradition's sake, he recognizes that traditional practices in mysticism can embed deep wisdom which should not be disregarded entirely.
</li><li><b>Dichotomy of Small and Big Non–duality</b>: Leo introduces the distinction between 'small non–duality', a limited and possibly egoistic understanding of the concept, and 'big non–duality', a holistic and inclusive approach that respects the complexity of enlightenment and the importance of values and ethics.
</li><li><b>Pitfalls of Initial Non–dual Experiences</b>: Individuals new to non–duality who gain initial experiences can become arrogant, creating a higher level of duality while claiming to be non–dual due to inexperience and lack of mastery.
</li><li><b>Small vs. Big Non–duality</b>: Small non–duality pits itself against other approaches, fostering rivalry, criticism, and a sense of superiority. In contrast, big non–duality is humble, integrating both the non–dual and dual aspects, and recognizes practical realities such as good and evil.
</li><li><b>Maturity in Non–dual Practice</b>: Big non–duality practitioners don't engage in ideological battles and are open to various techniques, such as therapy and self–help, understanding that not everyone can immediately pursue deep spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Chaos on Mount Hiei</b>: The lack of big non–duality understanding could have contributed to the issues on Mount Hiei; it emphasizes inclusivity and lack of competition and could require years to master.
</li><li><b>Zen Devil and Wild Fox Zen</b>: Zen Devil refers to someone who has had an enlightenment experience but lacks broader knowledge or study, while Wild Fox Zen represents the opposite–book knowledge without practice. Both extremes can be problematic, with the middle path being ideal.
</li><li><b>10,000–Hour Rule for Mastery</b>: Mastery in any field, including non–duality, generally requires at least 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Non–duality is not exempt from this rule and could require even more time to fully understand and embody.
</li><li><b>Variety and Depth of Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment can vary in depth and there are different types, with minor insights being just as important as major ones. True enlightenment transforms one's emotions, mind structure, and habitual reactions, which takes extensive work beyond initial insights.
</li><li><b>Post–Enlightenment Transformation</b>: After enlightenment, negative relationship patterns and habits may persist, so work is needed to transform these areas and cultivate unconditional love and enlightened relationships.
</li><li><b>Habits Persistence</b>: Cultural influences and bad habits (such as substance abuse or poor diet) persist post–enlightenment and must be actively changed, a danger overlooked by neo–advaita's focus on existential breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>Need for Worldly Education</b>: Understanding existential truths doesn't equate to worldly knowledge. Education in practical areas remains essential, and ignorance can lead to poor choices affecting society.
</li><li><b>Community Engagement and Citizenship</b>: Being an enlightened individual also means being a good citizen and caring for one's community. Neglecting societal responsibilities reveals a lack of true enlightenment embodiment.
</li><li><b>Ethical Career Choices</b>: It's crucial for those who are enlightened to pursue careers that contribute positively to society and the environment, aligning with the principles of non–duality.
</li><li><b>Transcending Cultural Limitations</b>: Enlightenment doesn't erase cultural conditioning; effort is needed to overcome negative cultural influences, such as racism, and to develop a more cosmopolitan understanding.
</li><li><b>Physical Health</b>: It is important to focus on physical health by ensuring proper nutrition and exercise, which are part of a comprehensive approach to enlightenment, beyond just non–duality.
</li><li><b>Character and Ethics</b>: Developing good character and strong ethics is essential; moral and ethical considerations remain important even when considering the existential perspective of non–duality.
</li><li><b>Ecological Awareness</b>: Concern for ecology, the environment, and all living beings, including animals and plants, is an aspect of a more holistic approach to spirituality and enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Powers</b>: Exploring spiritual powers can deepen one's spirituality beyond the realm of non–duality, aiding in healing others, teaching, and understanding.
</li><li><b>The Value of Understanding</b>: Understanding a broad range of fields, such as business, history, and science, enriches the insights gained from enlightenment, making it more valuable than the enlightenment experience itself.
</li><li><b>Post–Enlightenment Practice</b>: True enlightenment involves continuous practice and compassionate functioning, not a static state achieved in one moment.
</li><li><b>Hazards of Overemphasis on Non–duality</b>: Focusing solely on non–duality risks emotional bypass, where deep emotional issues are ignored, and character splits can worsen, leading to a divide between an ideal self and a shadow self.
</li><li><b>Goodness and Non–duality</b>: Goodness and ethical behavior are distinct from enlightenment. While good and bad are not existentially absolute, they hold practical significance and are included in the non–dual understanding.
</li><li><b>Social Responsibility and Non–duality</b>: Enlightened individuals should act responsibly in society, recognizing the consequences of their actions under the social contract.
</li><li><b>The Danger of Misusing Non–duality</b>: Misusing non–duality to justify harmful actions can lead to individuals becoming 'Zen Devils', causing suffering instead of alleviating it.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as a Choice of Lifestyle</b>: Realizing life is a game doesn't excuse inaction or destructive behavior. Enlightenment offers the choice to live consciously, responsibly, and with compassion for the suffering of others.
</li><li><b>Using Enlightenment Constructively</b>: Enlightenment teachings should be embodied in one's life constructively, not used as weapons against others, to live aligned with higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Continuous Development and Enlightenment</b>: Personal and psychological development, relationship building, and self–improvement work are valuable and contribute to the journey towards enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Nuanced Approach to Non–duality</b>: Balancing non–duality with practical wisdom is key; true mastery is rare and involves avoiding the many traps on either side of extremes.
