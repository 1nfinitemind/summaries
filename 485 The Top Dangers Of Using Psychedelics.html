            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mgLTBJBWZtM' target='_blank'>The Top Dangers Of Using Psychedelics</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Risk of Overdosing</b>: Overdosing can be mild, causing discomfort and danger, or extreme, leading to possible death. Users must understand proper dosages and use precision to avoid taking too much.
</li><li><b>Physical Harm During Trips</b>: Trips can result in self–inflicted injuries if users lose control or are in unsafe environments. Safe, indoor locations and sitting still can prevent this kind of physical harm.
</li><li><b>Vomiting from Psychedelics</b>: To prevent nausea and vomiting, it's advised to consume psychedelics on an empty stomach, waiting at least four hours after eating.
</li><li><b>Severity of Bad Trips</b>: Bad trips can be intensely frightening, with perception of never–ending torment and loss of reality. This can be avoided by taking lower doses and having a grounded, psychologically stable mindset.
</li><li><b>Misuse and Abuse by Inexperienced Users</b>: Lack of research and careless attitudes lead to misuse. It's important to stress safety and education, especially since some approach psychedelics with immaturity or competitiveness.
</li><li><b>Facing Fears and Trauma on Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics may bring up repressed fears and traumas, which is part of growth. However, high doses might unleash too much too quickly, causing distress rather than healing.
</li><li><b>Importance of Experience and Intention in Psychedelic Use</b>: Those considering psychedelics should be well–informed, prepared for potential effects, and avoid high doses that are taken for egoic reasons or to impress others.
</li><li><b>Contemplating and Situating for Psychedelics</b>: Ensuring a safe physical space and preparing to remain still during a trip can reduce the risks of physical harm. Avoiding outdoor or dangerous settings is recommended.
</li><li><b>Understanding the full impact of psychedelics</b>: With over 100 personal trips and extensive research, Leo emphasizes the need to comprehend both the positive and the transformative potential of psychedelics alongside the risks and dangers. 
</li><li><b>Emphasizing the dangers before benefits</b>: Although Leo advocates the use of psychedelics, he dedicates this particular episode to focus solely on the dangers without discussing the benefits to provide a comprehensive understanding of the risks.
</li><li><b>Sharing from Direct Experience</b>: Leo's insights on the dangers of psychedelics come from his own experiences, interactions with users, and theoretical study, giving him credibility in outlining these dangers.
</li><li><b>Sober Mind Required for Psychedelic Use</b>: Psychedelics necessitate a sober and responsible approach, aiming to avoid reckless behavior and to understand the serious nature of the substances being used. 
</li><li><b>Comprehensive List of Dangers</b>: The episode lists nearly all conceivable dangers, topped by the risk of overdosing, to ensure users are fully aware of what they may encounter.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Dosage Negligence</b>: Users often underestimate the potency of psychedelics and take doses that are too high, leading to dangerous outcomes which can include extreme disorientation and psychological issues.
</li><li><b>Psychological Risks in Negative Spirals</b>: Paranoid or depressive minds are more susceptible to bad trips, making it crucial to manage doses according to one's psychological state and ability to control negative thoughts. 
</li><li><b>Integration of Trauma through Measured Exposure</b>: Psychedelics may compel users to confront personal traumas, but it's key to do so incrementally with lower doses to prevent overwhelming and potentially damaging experiences.
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility in Psychedelic Use</b>: The decision to engage with psychedelics should be personal, well–considered, and backed by informed knowledge about the substances' effects and risks.
</li><li><b>Misconception about Dose Importance</b>: Increasing psychedelic dosage does not necessarily yield better results. Like overdoing it in the gym can cause injury, excessively high doses can lead to trauma and prolonged recovery, hampering progress.
</li><li><b>The Proper Rate of Deconstruction</b>: Gradual mind deconstruction with psychedelics is beneficial, but an excessive rate can cause psychological instability, existential crises, and severe mental health problems.
</li><li><b>Potential Long–Term Consequences</b>: Overwhelming experiences with psychedelics may lead to PTSD, anxiety, nightmares, depression, and solipsism, which can hinder regular personal development activities.
</li><li><b>Psychological Instability and Loss of Illusions</b>: High doses of psychedelics can result in a loss of a sense of reality, illusions, depersonalization, and even lead to institutionalization due to mental health crises.
</li><li><b>Managing Confusion</b>: Psychedelics can cause confusion about reality, which if mismanaged, can lead to stress and imprudent decisions with lasting impacts.
</li><li><b>Mental Illness and Psychedelic Use</b>: Individuals with mental illnesses should approach psychedelics with extreme caution; while they may offer benefits for some, they can also exacerbate psychological issues significantly.
</li><li><b>Research and Mental Illness</b>: Thorough personal research and learning from the experiences of others with similar conditions are vital before using psychedelics, especially for those with mental illnesses.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics Impacting Life Goals</b>: Usage can lead individuals to question and potentially abandon important life pursuits, like business or family commitments, sometimes to the detriment of one's previously set goals.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as Escape from Survival Problems</b>: Using psychedelics might make basic life challenges and survival seem insignificant, which can derail individuals' focus from building a successful life in the material world.
</li><li><b>Neglecting Material Responsibilities</b>: Engaging deeply in psychedelics can lead to a diminished concern for material responsibilities such as jobs, household tasks, and family care. It's essential not to neglect these aspects of life despite the allure of mystical experiences.
</li><li><b>Balance Between Mystical and Material Realms</b>: Achieving success in material reality is important for overall well–being and can influence one's spiritual pursuits. Keeping an eye on both spiritual growth and practical life necessities is crucial.
</li><li><b>Social Isolation Risks</b>: Psychedelic use might result in withdrawing from social interactions and becoming isolated, which can create a solipsistic, antisocial mindset.
</li><li><b>Risks of Making Rash Decisions Post–Trip</b>: Decisions made shortly after a psychedelic experience might be impulsive and regrettable. Waiting for at least a week to stabilize before making significant life decisions is recommended.
</li><li><b>Demotivating Impact on Meditation Practice</b>: Psychedelics can significantly demotivate a regular meditation practice by providing a shortcut to states of consciousness that traditionally take years of practice to achieve.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Chronic Psychedelic Use</b>: Using psychedelics more than once every two weeks can lead to a dependency, erosion of the sense of reality, and a decrease in mental clarity.
</li><li><b>Corruption of Mystical Insights by the Ego</b>: Insights gained during psychedelic experiences can be misinterpreted by the ego upon returning to normal consciousness, leading to delusional beliefs and behaviors like messiah complexes or unwarranted feelings of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Importance of Continued Self–Inquiry</b>: It is important to maintain a clear and unbiased mind through self–inquiry and other practices to avoid corrupting the understanding of psychedelic visions with personal biases and egotisms.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Mystical Experiences</b>: Engaging with psychedelics without a clear and unbiased mind leads to toxic mystical experiences influenced by personal biases which Leo refers to as "zen devilry."
</li><li><b>Incomplete Understanding of Reality</b>: Users might believe they have a full grasp on reality after one or two psychedelic experiences, but comprehending its many facets usually requires multiple trips and years of exploration.
</li><li><b>Pain of Disconnection from God</b>: Repeated experiences of god consciousness can create a pain of disconnection in regular life, which may lead to addiction to the feelings experienced under psychedelics, potentially degrading quality of life.
</li><li><b>Potential for Suicidal Thoughts</b>: Psychedelics can induce suicidal tendencies due to various reasons, such as feelings of meaninglessness or a desire to merge with God. Immediate discontinuation is recommended if such thoughts arise.
</li><li><b>Legal Implications of Psychedelic Use</b>: Awareness of the legal risks associated with psychedelics is crucial, including understanding the laws and potential consequences of getting caught with these substances. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Distributing Psychedelics</b>: Sharing psychedelics with others can lead to being tried as a drug dealer, which entails serious legal repercussions. It's essential to avoid any actions that might imply distribution.
</li><li><b>Taking Unknown Substances</b>: Consuming substances without understanding their source, purity, or dosage is extremely risky. Users should only take substances from trusted sources to ensure safety.
</li><li><b>Toxicity from Impure Substances</b>: Taking impure substances can cause physical harm. Substances like MDMA and LSD, especially from unreliable sources like raves, can contain high levels of impurities.
</li><li><b>Physically Damaging Psychedelics</b>: Certain psychedelics such as ketamine, MDMA, and nitrous oxide can cause physical damage to the body. Users should stick to classic psychedelics like DMT, mescaline, mushrooms, and LSD for safety.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Dangerous Substances</b>: Some psychedelics like salvia and deterra are considered dangerous due to their chaotic effects and should be avoided entirely.
</li><li><b>Bad Interactions with Medications</b>: Mixing psychedelics with certain medications, especially SSRIs, can be lethal, and users should thoroughly research any potential interactions before using psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Risks of Mixing Substances</b>: Combining multiple chemical substances can lead to unforeseen and potentially fatal interactions; users are cautioned to avoid mixing substances.
</li><li><b>Risks of combining psychedelics with other substances</b>: Combining psychedelics with medications, supplements, or other psychedelics can lead to dangerous interactions, making it difficult to identify which substance is causing what effect. It is safest to use one chemical at a time.
</li><li><b>Gateway to recreational hard drugs</b>: Psychedelics can potentially lead to the use of hard drugs like cocaine or heroin, which can be dangerous and addictive. Users must draw a clear line between psychedelics and recreational drugs.
</li><li><b>Chronic weed addiction</b>: The combination of weed with psychedelics may enhance the experience for some but carries the risk of paranoia and addiction, especially when weed is used frequently.
</li><li><b>Hazards of tripping in recreational areas</b>: Tripping in environments like parties, raves, or outdoors can lead to dangerous situations. A comfortable and private space is the safest setting for using psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Dangers of research chemicals</b>: New and understudied research chemicals carry unknown risks and the possibility of receiving harmful batches. It is important to be cautious and well–informed before using these substances.
</li><li><b>Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD)</b>: HPPD is a rare but possible long–lasting effect of psychedelics causing visual and auditory distortions that can interfere with enjoying normal life.
</li><li><b>Legal consequences of extraction and synthesis</b>: Extracting, synthesizing, or growing psychedelics can result in being charged with operating a drug lab, leading to severe legal penalties, including prison.
</li><li><b>Potential for online scams</b>: Purchasing psychedelics online can be risky due to scams and the chance of financial loss or receiving fake products.
</li><li><b>Driving under the influence</b>: Leo advises against driving while on psychedelics to prevent accidents and recommends waiting until the effects have nearly worn off before operating a vehicle.
</li><li><b>Common mistakes with psychedelics</b>: Users often make errors such as treating psychedelics irresponsibly, using high and inaccurate doses, frequent use, tripping in dangerous or social environments, not staying still, and underestimating the impact of existing mental illnesses.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic use requires caution and risk management</b>: All activities have inherent risks, and while many hazards of psychedelic use can be managed, it requires responsibility and mindfulness. If someone is very risk–averse, psychedelics might not be suitable for them.
</li><li><b>Avoiding recklessness in psychedelic experiences</b>: Good practice includes accurately measuring doses, avoiding chronic use, and steering clear of environments that can lead to adverse outcomes. Maturity and stability are crucial for avoiding the top mistakes made by psychedelic users.
</li><li><b>Lack of theoretical foundation</b>: Without a solid theoretical understanding of metaphysics, epistemology, and non–dual consciousness, using psychedelics can be misguided. Leo warns against neglecting the intellectual groundwork provided through Actualized.org and similar resources.
</li><li><b>Neglecting personal development work</b>: Assuming psychedelics will handle all aspects of personal growth is a mistake. Practices like meditation, reading, and contemplation are necessary for a well–rounded spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Premature cessation of psychedelic exploration</b>: Leo highlights the error in thinking that a few psychedelic trips are enough to grasp their essence. He suggests that it can take around a hundred trips to start to understand the potential of psychedelics for spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Treating psychedelic use as a long–term process</b>: It's essential to spread out psychedelic journeys and treat them as a multi–year exploration rather than a quick fix. As usage increases, so does the necessity for caution and methodical practice.
</li><li><b>Individual responsibility in deciding to use psychedelics</b>: Leo emphasizes that the decision to engage with psychedelics is personal. His goal is to outline their risks and potential benefits without convincing anyone to use them.
</li><li><b>Importance of psychedelics in understanding reality</b>: Psychedelics can provide the most direct understanding of reality, God, love, and consciousness. Even though permanent enlightenment might not be achieved, the experience itself can have great benefits.
</li><li><b>Responsible promotion of psychedelics</b>: Leo plans to advocate for responsible psychedelic use further, emphasizing its role in understanding metaphysical and spiritual concepts that may remain obscure through other methods.
</li><li><b>Societal transformation and responsible paths for psychedelic use</b>: Leo believes society needs to change its views on psychedelics and create a responsible path that includes not just clinical but spiritual use for the highest metaphysical understanding and human development.
</li><li><b>Future emphasis on psychedelics by Leo</b>: He plans to expand on the importance of psychedelics in the context of Actualized.org's teachings, aiming to integrate them as a crucial supplement to traditional spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Commitment to responsible usage</b>: Leo promises to maintain a zero–tolerance policy towards irresponsible use of psychedelics, insisting on high standards of conduct and preparation for those following this path.
