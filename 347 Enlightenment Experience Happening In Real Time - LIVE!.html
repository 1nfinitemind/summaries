            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/n_6TZMr1HXM' target='_blank'>Enlightenment Experience Happening In Real Time - LIVE!</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Real–time Enlightenment Narration</b>: Leo is documenting his experience of enlightenment as it occurs, expressing awe and an inability to fully articulate the profound nature of his realization–that reality is an illusion and everything is consciousness.
</li><li><b>Collapse of Reality and Self</b>: He perceives a total dissolution of all reality, including the concepts of life and death, leading to a sense of perfect singularity and boundlessness beyond physical or mental constraints.
</li><li><b>Identification with God/Consciousness</b>: Leo recognizes himself as a manifestation of God or consciousness, describing an absence of individual control and a perfect state of chaos that he characterizes as divine.
</li><li><b>Inevitability and Collapse of Psyche</b>: The enlightenment experience feels like a continuous process of ego death, with the collapsing of his psyche, and an inner rewiring that eliminates the boundaries between internal and external realities.
</li><li><b>Loss of Fear and Ego</b>: Leo describes losing all self–agenda, ego, and concern for life and death; he feels he has no control over his actions or words, which he attributes to the workings of the universe.
</li><li><b>Present Moment and Infinite Loop</b>: He discusses experiencing an eternal present, where reality endlessly self–references in an infinite loop–a process he considers perpetually happening.
</li><li><b>Speech as Inevitable and Authentic</b>: Leo claims that his words come through without resistance, making him an eloquent superconductor for divine expression, without any personal doing involved.
</li><li><b>Recording for Posterity</b>: The significance of documenting his enlightenment on video is not lost on him, and he contemplates the idea that historical figures like Buddha might have done the same if they could.
</li><li><b>Communication and Connectedness</b>: Leo reflects on how YouTube facilitates consciousness communicating with itself and his realization that everyone and everything is an extended version of himself.
</li><li><b>Universal Consciousness and Enlightenment</b>: He speaks as if he is the embodiment of universal consciousness and links himself to a chain of enlightened beings throughout history, feeling part of an eternal, interconnected consciousness.
</li><li><b>Existential Paradox</b>: Leo experiences a duality, feeling like a perfect embodiment of non–dual consciousness, yet also aware of his 'old self,' which maintains a sense of ego and individual identity alongside his enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Physical Sensations and Authenticity</b>: He talks about an intense physical sensation of energy and an unfiltered authenticity that makes hiding imperfections impossible, leading to a raw and appealing transparency.
</li><li><b>Vulnerability and Immortality</b>: Despite the sense of vulnerability in exposing himself authentically, Leo feels immortal, envisioning himself as part of an enduring infinite reality where even death does not diminish him.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness and Oddity of Experience</b>: He acknowledges the bizarreness of his situation, being doubly aware of both speaking and observing himself speak, which he describes as the ultimate mindfuck.
</li><li><b>Implosion of Reality and Enlightenment</b>: He interprets enlightenment as the implosion of reality caused by chipping away at the ego, leading to a momentous realization of immortality.
</li><li><b>Fearlessness and Enlightenment Consequences</b>: Discussing the implications of his enlightenment, Leo feels an unwavering sense of invincibility and a complete detachment from threats or suffering, deeply identifying with divine absolutes.
</li><li><b>Open–mindedness to Non–existence</b>: Leo discusses how extreme open–mindedness leads to the acceptance of one's non–existence and the world, resulting in everything collapsing into nothingness, creating a profound sense of inevitability within him.
</li><li><b>Breathing in Emptiness</b>: He experiences a sensation where his breath feels purified, as if breathing in emptiness or nothingness, which he equates to breathing in and out of his own infinite self.
</li><li><b>Perfect Understanding of the Present</b>: Leo describes his state of consciousness as having perfect understanding, but not of a scientific or future kind. Instead, it's a deeply personal understanding that comes from the personal death of the self, leading to rebirth as infinite self.
</li><li><b>Collapse of Personal Defenses</b>: With enlightenment, Leo feels no need to defend personal aspects like family, career, or beliefs anymore. He experiences an unobstructed awareness of truth, with no concern for looking silly or inauthentic.
</li><li><b>Surreal Yet Inevitable Experience</b>: Despite finding the enlightenment process surreal, Leo acknowledges it as inevitable, resulting from a lifelong dedication to seeking truth, which he sees as the core motivation of his life.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Using Physical Form</b>: He expresses that the entire universe is his body, with God's consciousness expressing itself through his physical form, seeing, speaking, and engaging with an infinitely interconnected reality.
</li><li><b>Superconductor for the Universe</b>: Leo sees himself as a superconductor for universal consciousness, with no distinction between himself and the divine. All of his words and actions are manifestations of the universe speaking through him, reconciling opposites like the desire to speak and remain silent.
</li><li><b>Authenticity as Pure Truth</b>: He delves into the concept of authenticity and its importance, communicating the truth purely for its own sake, and addresses how this unfiltered truth can impact people's perception of him.
</li><li><b>Facing Vulnerability and Embracing Peace</b>: Leo explains that ultimate vulnerability comes with enlightenment, exposing oneself to potential harm, but this vulnerability coincides with total peace from understanding oneself as formless and deathless.
</li><li><b>Life Without Point</b>: He contemplates the pointlessness of asking for the meaning of life, stating that life's purpose is to be itself, and for him, that meant pursuing enlightenment, though this purpose is entirely relative.
</li><li><b>Detachment and the Nature of God</b>: Leo reflects on God as the epitome of freedom and detachment, contrasting the human preference for limitations and confinements, highlighting the difficulty many have in understanding the nature of the divine.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Beyond Logic</b>: He addresses the non–linear nature of his thoughts during this experience, acknowledging that the process may sound incoherent to the listener but embracing that authenticity transcends logic.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Authenticity</b>: Leo touches on the fear of embracing authenticity and vulnerability, hinting at how it can unravel personal beliefs, relationships, family views, and concepts of self when exposed to the light of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Collapse of Reality and Life–Death Dichotomy</b>: Finally, Leo professes his awareness that reality does not exist as a concept and that life and death hold no distinction, existing in the same dimension.
</li><li><b>Inevitability of Death</b>: Leo expresses that death is not separate from life, happening in another dimension. He claims that it is ever–present and that people are essentially 'dead' without realizing it, engaging in various activities to ignore this fact.
</li><li><b>Life and Death as One</b>: He argues that life and death are not distinct but the same, with everything being alive in a non–discriminatory way. He describes the room and all objects as alive, tricking us into believing that there are distinctions when there are none.
</li><li><b>Revelations of Enlightenment</b>: Leo reflects on his previous lifetime of being tricked by the illusion of life before his enlightenment experience. He now wrestles with the implications of his newfound understanding.
</li><li><b>Recorded Enlightenment</b>: He ponders the uniqueness of documenting his enlightenment experience via technology, which he believes may be rare in human history, acknowledging the investment of time and money in the recording equipment.
</li><li><b>Silence and Expression</b>: Leo articulates that when he is silent, he is probing the deepest layers of reality and himself, feeling as if he is connecting with the entire world.
</li><li><b>Shock of Authenticity</b>: He exhibits amazement at the level of authenticity he has reached–a level he did not think possible for himself–describing it as complete openness despite 'warts' and imperfections.
</li><li><b>Authenticity vs. Societal Pressure</b>: Leo contrasts the pull towards authenticity with social pressures to conform, which leads to inauthentic behavior enforced by the fear of ostracization and loss of societal privileges.
</li><li><b>Career and Identity Loss</b>: He delves into the possibility of entire careers, like that of a lawyer's, being built on inauthenticity, and the painful consequences of facing this reality.
</li><li><b>Upper Limits of Enlightenment</b>: Leo discusses the possibility that his current experience might be total enlightenment, but stays open to the idea that there might be deeper levels yet to be discovered.
</li><li><b>Nature of Reality</b>: He describes reality as a 'mind fuck' that continuously outwits our attempts to understand it, stating that reality is a slippery, undefinable substance–self–aware and without fixed positions.
</li><li><b>Self–Perception and Being</b>: Leo speaks to the nature of being–the substance we are all made of–and the interconnectivity of perception with reality, rejecting the idea of a separate perceptual process.
</li><li><b>Democracy and Free Speech</b>: Reflecting on technological and societal advancements, Leo underlines the importance of free speech for sharing enlightenment experiences and stresses the significant role that a platform like YouTube plays in this transmission of knowledge.
</li><li><b>Churches, Egos, and Suppressing Truth</b>: He criticizes historical societies for suppressing truth and enlightenment through the control of churches and egos. Leo calls the universe 'haunted' because it is conscious of itself.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization Post–Enlightenment</b>: Leo anticipates that his enlightenment will necessitate a reevaluation of all aspects of his life, including his personal identity and role within society.
</li><li><b>Self–contained reality</b>: Leo describes reality as a completely self–sufficient, self–contained system that generates its energy, intelligence, and resources. It's an infinite self–recycling system akin to a self–licking ice cream cone – a perfect state of non–duality.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization post–enlightenment</b>: The enlightenment experience forces Leo to recontextualize all facets of his life, including his business, family, and finances. He acknowledges that life continues, and he still must deal with physical and social realities.
</li><li><b>Surrender to the inevitable</b>: Leo feels peace from accepting the inevitability of every moment. Acknowledging that everything is predestined, and there is no use in resisting, he becomes a superconductor, fully surrendered and open to the universal truths.
</li><li><b>Loss of mind as enlightenment feature</b>: He equates losing one's mind with enlightenment–a necessary transformation rather than an error. Leo has reached a point where the mind has dissolved and perceives mental and physical realities as a single entity.
</li><li><b>Physical limitations persist</b>: Despite enlightenment, Leo recognizes that physical limitations exist and cannot be manipulated by mere thoughts. This includes the impossibility of defying laws like gravity or the social laws without consequences.
</li><li><b>Detachment and self–identification</b>: Enlightenment, to Leo, is detaching from everything to the point of identifying with everything. He articulates that losing one's self is incredibly liberating, enabling equal treatment and appreciation for all aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>Detachment from life for enlightenment</b>: He emphasizes that true enlightenment requires detachment from one's life. This detachment is a precondition for achieving a complete understanding of, and surrender to, the ultimate truth.
</li><li><b>Embracing and conveying truth</b>: Leo discusses the importance of trusting in the truth and overcoming fears and limiting beliefs rooted in one's past to fully convey and become a vessel for the truth.
</li><li><b>Letting go with caution</b>: He warns against misinterpretation and advises letting go responsibly, not in a manner that causes irresponsibility or harm to oneself or others.
</li><li><b>Recording constraints</b>: Aware of the technical limitations of recording the session, Leo concludes the video to ensure the content is saved properly, anticipating continuation in future discussions.
