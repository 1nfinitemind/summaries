        <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/rethinking-human-history' target='_blank'>Rethinking Human History</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Three generational framework of humanity</strong> : At any point in human history, only three generations are contemporaneously alive: the youth, middle-aged, and the elderly. The youngest (0-25 years) are often uninformed or misinformed, heavily influenced by the middle-aged (25-55 years), who hold most societal control and experience, while the eldest generation (60+ years) contains individuals who, despite sometimes possessing significant influence, are generally seen as the outgoing generation whose role in society is diminishing.</li>
<li><strong>Epistemic implications of generational limits</strong> : The limited generational overlap has profound implications on our collective knowledge. No living person today has experienced life without modern amenities like electricity, leading to a generational disconnection that impacts our understanding of past human experiences. Consequently, this contributes to a history that is often simplified or whitewashed, failing to convey the struggle of survival in eras gone by.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of technology on historical understanding</strong> : Advancements in technology create a chasm between generations. For instance, the current generation cannot fully grasp a pre-internet era, similar to how we can't imagine life without cars or modern conveniences. This evolution can lead to a loss of historical understanding and appreciation, with modern life's complexities taken for granted due to the rapid changes in technology and society. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of environment on worldviews</strong> : Our worldview is heavily tied to our environment and survival within it. The historical context of our ancestors, defined by manual labor and simple tools, shaped their perspectives and lives significantly. Today's world, filled with advanced technology and global connectivity, leads to fundamentally different life experiences and worldviews.</li>
<li><strong>Generational relay of reality</strong> : Individuals are born into an existing narrative about reality, learning about life from previous generations. This relay of information shapes our sense of self and understanding of our place in time. If this narrative were absent, individuals would face existential crises due to uncertainties about existence and purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Bias in historical education</strong> : The history conveyed in educational systems is inherently biased, focusing on nationalistic narratives over a global understanding. Even with the things we are taught, the full breadth of human history is often left unexplored, leaving us with a skewed sense of the past that influences our current worldview and knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to change in history</strong> : Throughout history, resistance to change has been a constant, with innovations often met with suspicion or outright opposition. Over time, radical ideas that were initially resisted became integral parts of society, illustrating the importance of reexamining resistance in the context of progressive change.</li>
<li><strong>Increased comfort and conformity</strong> : With technological advancements making life more convenient, there's a tendency to believe that our current understanding of society and reality has reached its peak. This comfort leads to conformity and impedes the exploration of alternate societal structures and ways of living that could be more adaptable to future changes.</li>
<li><strong>Science as a narrative</strong> : Science, though often considered as factual, serves the same narrative function as religion in providing stories to understand our existence. These narratives simplify the complexity of reality into understandable chunks, which are embraced and rarely questioned, much like religious texts.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of historical perspective</strong> : Our limited access to the perspectives of past generations confines our worldview, preventing us from fully appreciating the breadth of human experience. The lack of interaction with generations long gone and the inability to dialogue with non-human entities means that mankind's perception of reality is constrained to the brief overlap between three living generations.</li>
<li><strong>Influence of upbringing on personal worldview</strong> : The environment in which we are raised and the historical context provided by our parents profoundly influence our belief system, morality, and sense of self. For example, ideas that seem alien in one era, such as the wrongness of slavery, could be considered absolute truths in another, just as today's concepts might be unthinkably radical in the distant past.</li>
<li><strong>Personal history as the foundation for understanding</strong> : Individuals are born into an unknown world and rely on their immediate predecessors to shape their conception of reality. Generations inherit and pass on their understanding of the world, and without this continuum, people might find themselves in an existential crisis due to lack of historical context.</li>
<li><strong>Educational bias and its relation to personal identity</strong> : The narratives we learn in school are heavily influenced by cultural and national bias, significantly affecting our worldview and identity. The limited scope of history taught reflects the selective priorities of each society, often neglecting the broader historical context that could offer a more diverse and realistic perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Fragility and bias of human culture and knowledge</strong> : Our collective knowledge and culture consist of stories from just three generations, subjectively shaped by each era's dominant forces. This narrative-driven understanding of history and reality reveals the precarious and biased nature of what we accept as truth.</li>
<li><strong>Historical gaps in religious understanding</strong> : Despite Christianity being a significant part of many people's lives, there is a general failure to recognize that human history extends far back beyond the last 2000 years of Christian teachings. This oversight ignores the fact that humans existed and thrived for hundreds of thousands of years without organized religions like Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, or Hinduism, all of which are modern constructs in the grand timeline of humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Science as a constructed narrative</strong> : Just as religion provided stories for understanding the world, modern science similarly offers narratives that structure our reality-stories about atoms, molecules, cells, and galaxies-yet remains a constructed story. These scientific explanations are essentially contemporary myths that fill in the gaps in our understanding, much like the genealogies in religious texts, giving a false impression of continuity and comprehensive understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal perspective and materialism</strong> : Materialism, the belief that only physical matter is real, is relatively new and does not reflect the diversity of philosophical perspectives throughout history. The limited generational span of human life means that we're unable to appreciate the depth of past philosophical thought, with materialism being a current "fad" rather than enduring truth, demonstrating that our grasp of reality is shaped by the fads and ideas prevalent in the short-lived generations we can interact with.</li>
<li><strong>Relativity of normalcy and implications on worldview</strong> : What is considered "normal" is entirely relative to the era and environment someone is born into. The lack of a true baseline for normalcy leads to a highly adaptable sense of reality that is easily molded by those in control of the narrative, as illustrated by the thought experiment of raising a child in isolation with manipulated information-it highlights the profound impact environment and narrative control have on an individual's perception of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance reinforced by generational transmission</strong> : The pervasive nature of ignorance can be attributed to the fact that a majority of what individuals know is passed down without questioning. This uninhibited transfer includes all aspects of knowledge, such as science, religion, culture, and societal norms, underlining the fact that control over this process is an illusion, with each generation simply perpetuating the programming received from previous ones stretching back millennia.</li>
<li><strong>No single origin of human knowledge</strong> : The vast chain of human evolution spans millions of years beyond the mythological Adam and Eve, implicating that our collected knowledge and existence began long before recorded history. The narrative of reality as we understand it is not the work of a single entity but an accumulation of generational transfer of beliefs and conjectures.</li>
<li><strong>Ubiquitous ignorance and unverified beliefs</strong> : Individuals, including experts, philosophers, and religious leaders, are engulfed in the same narratives and beliefs as everyone else. Consequently, they can't provide definitive answers about reality-they only believe they understand based on the inherited worldviews, which explains the defensive posture when their beliefs are questioned.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to inquiry stems from fear</strong> : Those who discourage questioning often project their own insecurities and reliance on established systems for survival. For example, challenging a parent's employment ethics can threaten their livelihood and stability, illustrating how survival pressures enforce conformity and acceptance of the status quo.</li>
<li><strong>Worldview and epistemology beyond science</strong> : While scientific knowledge advances, it does not encompass the entirety of reality understanding. Worldview, ethics, morality, and even societal attractions and repulsions are subject to change and require critical examination beyond what traditional scientific inquiry addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Irrecoverable historical wisdom and invention</strong> : Countless ideas, insights, and inventions throughout history have been completely lost or suppressed due to lack of adoption, destruction, or obfuscation. Past thinkers potentially had profound knowledge that never survived through the ages, suggesting that modern humanity may not be at the peak of wisdom or knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural and societal indoctrination limits future visioning</strong> : The societal emphasis on fitting in and conforming squanders the potential for radical reimagining of future societies. By transcending past and present preconceptions, humans can brainstorm entirely new social structures that could redefine work, relationships, governance, and existence itself.</li>
<li><strong>Inherent bias in perceptions of history</strong> : Our understanding of ancient structures or historical figures is often clouded by modern biases and ideologies. For example, archaeologists may misinterpret the pyramids' purpose through a materialistic lens or Christians may misrepresent Jesus to align with contemporary political beliefs instead of historical contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic challenge to traditional education and conformity</strong> : Embracing flexibility and creativity in thinking about the future requires questioning deeply ingrained societal norms shaped by traditional education. By contemplating past human existence, we can prepare to construct envisioned futures unconstrained by current practices and beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Deconstruction of societal norms</strong> : Beyond personal self-inquiry, Leo emphasizes the need to deconstruct and critically examine societal structures, political systems, and cultural norms. With the rapid advancement of technology, the environment, and consequently, survival strategies are changing, requiring a departure from traditional ideas and increased flexibility and adaptability in all aspects of society.</li>
<li><strong>The inevitable evolution of societal structures</strong> : Leo points out that societal progress often hinges upon the generational shift, with older, more traditional generations passing away and making room for new perspectives. He uses the example of resistance to universal healthcare in the U.S. to illustrate the conflict between ingrained habits and the need for change, challenging the tendency to cling to tradition and emphasizing the necessity of radical flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of overarching control in historical progression</strong> : Dispelling notions of a controlling elite, Leo argues that humanity's progression is marked by collective ignorance; no single group masters the direction of societal development. Even conspiracies cannot grasp the full trajectory of human evolution, which might lead to a future where humanity is vastly different from its current state.</li>
<li><strong>Thought experiment on temporal dislocation</strong> : Leo presents a thought experiment where Socrates is brought into modern New York City, then returned to ancient Athens, illustrating the dissonance between historical periods and the challenges of integrating radically different realities, thereby highlighting how past, present, and future may be unimaginably distinct and unrecognizable from each other's viewpoints.</li>
