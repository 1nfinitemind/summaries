        <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/guerilla-business-advice' target='_blank'>Guerilla Business Advice</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Creative approach for success</strong> : Leo advises against unethical business strategies like exploiting others for personal gain. Instead, he champions the power of creativity as a more fulfilling and potentially successful path, offering the personal experience that led him toward self-reliant financial strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of childhood financial instability</strong> : Leo's early life experiences with financial hardship and witnessing his family's economic struggles instilled in him the necessity of having a robust plan for financial stability and the importance of developing valuable internal skills.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation over traditional employment</strong> : Rather than settling for a stable but uninspiring career such as computer programming, Leo emphasizes the potential of devising unique innovations and creative ideas that could contribute enormous value to society and bring substantial financial rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Generating value with limited resources</strong> : Leo stresses that significant opportunities are available for those willing to invent or innovate within their means, highlighting the possibility of creating small-scale, valuable projects without requiring a massive investment or a large team.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity's unmatched potential</strong> : By focusing on guerilla entrepreneurship and leaning into one's innate creativity rather than relying on external capital, individuals can create distinct and valuable contributions in various fields, such as writing, game development, or gadget invention.</li>
<li><strong>Guerilla creativity ethos</strong> : Pursuing small-scale, innovative projects that align with personal strengths and interests can lead to significant success and freedom from wage slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Creative selectivity in projects</strong> : Since individual creators often lack substantial capital, they must be extremely choosy with their ideas, seeking those that are innovative, valuable, and do not require heavy investment.</li>
<li><strong>Unleashing personal potential</strong> : The barriers to creating something of value, such as a hit pop music song, are often not financial but rather a matter of developing skill and creativity over time. </li>
<li><strong>Counter-narrative to systemic struggles</strong> : While there are important discussions about capitalism, socialism, and systemic oppression, individuals can still exercise creativity to uplift themselves, a pathway Leo has personally navigated.</li>
<li><strong>Individual vs. collective improvement</strong> : Large-scale policy changes and socio-economic reforms are essential, but individuals should also strive for personal success through creativity and innovation, rather than waiting for systemic solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Non-exploitative innovation</strong> : Creating and inventing in niches overlooked by large companies provides an opportunity to achieve personal wealth without exploitation, ultimately benefiting society by adding previously nonexistent value.</li>
<li><strong>Agile creativity advantage</strong> : Individual creators have the flexibility to pursue creative, high-risk projects that large corporations cannot, due to their agility and lower overheads, potentially leading to unique, valuable creations.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining discipline and motivation</strong> : Consistent creativity demands a disciplined and motivated approach, which contrasts with the replaceable nature of monotonous nine-to-five jobs, underscoring the need for personal initiative in creative work.</li>
<li><strong>Value of aligned life purpose</strong> : Clarity on one's life values and life purpose is critical for generating ideas that truly resonate, a topic Leo covers in his life purpose course, which lays the groundwork for sustained innovative success.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation through personal relevance</strong> : Instead of replicating others' ideas, innovators should draw high-level lessons and apply them to new domains that correspond with their unique interests and capacities, potentially leading to million-dollar breakthroughs.</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley case study</strong> : The success of Stardew Valley serves as an excellent example of how an individual can design and program a simple yet addictive game that resonates with a large audience. This game, inspired by the existing game Harvest Moon, highlighted the importance of creating a replayable game that fits a specific market niche.</li>
<li><strong>The journey of innovation</strong> : It demonstrates how initially small ideas can turn into huge successes. The creator of Stardew Valley didn't plan to make millions but instead aimed to develop a portfolio project. His dedication and adaptation of a familiar concept into a unique game led to unexpected and significant financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Key considerations in game development</strong> : For solo developers, focusing on a game that's easy to produce, addictive, and offers a lot of content is crucial. The challenge lies in creating something that combines ease of development with broad appeal, capturing a niche in the gaming market that's not oversaturated.</li>
<li><strong>Creative persistence</strong> : The creator's journey emphasizes consistent work, discipline, and the importance of remaining passionate and visionary despite not having an expansive team or resources. However, this success also hinged on luck, illustrating that while hard work is critical, timing and market reception play significant roles.</li>
<li><strong>Broader lessons</strong> : Rather than taking the story of Stardew Valley as a directive to make farming games, the broader lesson is to find one's niche that can be as lucrative and personally fulfilling as the niche found by Stardew Valley's creator.</li>
<li><strong>Creative proficiency in novel writing</strong> : To write a bestselling novel, one must go beyond mere writing skills to analyze the cultural zeitgeist, identify trends, and time the market correctly, bringing a unique twist to revive classical styles or inventing new categories altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Inventing new mediums and domains</strong> : Just as video games were once a new medium, creative individuals have opportunities to invent entirely new categories of products, services, or sports-original concepts that can transform into multi-billion-dollar industries over time.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding market demand</strong> : Assessing what captures the public's interest, like the craze for Pokémon, leveraging human instincts, like collecting, and combining them with innovative elements can lead to wildly successful creations that resonate with a wide audience.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity and research for creativity</strong> : Genuine creativity arises from a need, such as a career oriented around innovation, and is fueled by broad research across various fields, ensuring that one's creative output is informed, original, and grounded in understanding societal interests and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from existing concepts</strong> : The creation of Pokémon was inspired by the hobby of insect collecting, demonstrating how new ideas can emerge by building upon existing concepts and interests, leading to innovation and success.</li>
<li><strong>Pogs as a childhood craze</strong> : Pogs, originating as simple bottle caps, evolved into a collectible and competitive game for children, embodying the principles of collecting and gambling, which led to a widespread, albeit temporary, phenomenon in schools.</li>
<li><strong>Legos' unique appeal</strong> : The lasting popularity of Legos showcases the potential for simple concepts to become highly successful by allowing for flexible, creative play; innovators are challenged to invent similarly engaging and enduring toys without directly imitating existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Potential of virtual worlds</strong> : The future of virtual worlds, distinct from online games, promises a significant untapped market. The creation of a widely adopted virtual community could lead to immense financial success, rivaling major corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Focus for creative success</strong> : To maximize the effectiveness of one's creative endeavors, selecting a specific area or "lane" to specialize in-like kids' toys-allows for focused skill development and improved outcomes from successive projects.</li>
<li><strong>Caution against ambition without direction</strong> : Ambitious individuals are warned against putting all their resources into a single project, especially their first, as this can lead to financial and emotional setback instead of approaching creativity as a gradual, iterative process.</li>
<li><strong>Finding one's lane early</strong> : Recognizing one's strengths, interests, and values early on can help identify the right creative domain to pursue, aiding in the avoidance of scattered efforts across unrelated fields and setting the stage for future successes.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalizing on 9-to-5 job downtime</strong> : Use idle or non-intensive work periods during a 9-to-5 job to brainstorm and develop creative ideas, which can then be further worked on during personal time, such as weekends, allowing for gradual progress towards entrepreneurial goals.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving from brainstorming to business</strong> : Leo shares his personal experience of using free time during work as a game designer to brainstorm and lay the groundwork for his first business, exemplifying how one can utilize available time efficiently instead of engaging in unproductive activities.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity as a spiritual and infinite resource</strong> : Tapping into creativity connects you with the spiritual force that created the universe, offering endless possibilities to innovate. Most people underutilize this infinite resource, but engaging with it regularly can lead to significant contributions and personal rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Creative vs. competitive approach</strong> : Opt for an infinite, creative approach to achieve success, as opposed to a competitive or exploitative one, such as stock trading or cryptocurrency schemes. This creates a non-zero-sum environment where you can positively impact the world without taking from others.</li>
<li><strong>Conscious creation</strong> : Strive for inventions that raise consciousness and spread love, rather than contributing to societal harm. Creativity should be directed towards wholesome and uplifting endeavors that enhance the world, reflecting positively on your impact as an innovator.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace unique paths, avoid imitation</strong> : Leo advises against directly copying his path or work, as it prevents personal growth and discovering one's unique contributions. Creativity is not limited to certain fields and should extend beyond emulating someone else's success.</li>
<li><strong>The necessity for self-knowledge</strong> : To successfully undertake a creative, self-actualizing journey, one must have a deep understanding of themselves. Leo's life purpose course offers guidance through this process, ensuring alignment with personal values and motivations for sustained effort and fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Immediate action for life change</strong> : Recognizing the rewarding potential of a creatively fueled life, Leo suggests promptly starting this journey to avoid settling for less satisfying alternatives and to overcome excuses, fears, and limiting beliefs addressed in the life purpose course.</li>
