            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4JcOrC9LH9w' target='_blank'>Best Supplements - What You Must Know About Supplementation</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of Leo's Experience with Supplements</b>: Leo gives a brief insight into his biohacking journey and how he got into experimenting with supplements. He emphasizes his aim to enhance not only cognitive performance but also his physical health, including addressing a thyroid issue through supplements.
</li><li><b>Supplement Quantity and Reasons</b>: He takes about 25 different supplements, which he admits may be overkill and was partly due to experimenting and addressing thyroid issues.
</li><li><b>Pill Box System</b>: To manage his substantial daily intake, Leo uses a large pill box that fits all his supplements, allowing for convenience and ensuring he doesn't miss doses.
</li><li><b>Essential Omega–3 Fish Oil</b>: Leo starts with Omega–3 Fish Oil as a top recommended supplement due to its numerous health benefits like reducing inflammation and improving cardiovascular health. He takes two capsules daily from a high–quality, filtered source.
</li><li><b>Vitamin C Benefits</b>: Another recommended supplement is Vitamin C for its immune–boosting properties. Leo takes 100 milligrams daily and prefers two–stage time–release capsules for steady absorption throughout the day.
</li><li><b>Vitamin D3 Importance</b>: Stresses the crucial nature of Vitamin D3 and advises annual testing due to common deficiency caused by inadequate sunlight exposure. He suggests that the recommended doses are often too low and takes 10,000 IU's daily, based on his test results.
</li><li><b>Maca Root for Libido</b>: Leo lauds maca root for its powerful libido–enhancing effects on both men and women, labeling it as natural Viagra. He recommends it for reproductive health and notes the substantial anecdotal evidence in its support, especially amongst women.
</li><li><b>Maca Supplement Benefits</b>: Maca is recommended by Leo for both men and women to enhance energy and vigor, as well as strengthen the immune system. He suggests a daily 500 milligram dosage for general well–being.
</li><li><b>Vitamin A & Vision</b>: Leo praises the benefits of Vitamin A for improving vision, especially as someone with vision issues himself. He warns of the potential for overdose and suggests taking it in fish liver oil form for the best effect, as plant–based Vitamin A isn't as effective. A dose of 10,000 IU's is considered safe by him without blood tests.
</li><li><b>Magnesium for Digestive Health</b>: Magnesium is highlighted as crucial for bowel health, particularly for easing constipation. Leo recommends six chelated magnesium pills a day, emphasizing the importance of the chelated form for better bioavailability and absorption.
</li><li><b>EGCG from Green Tea</b>: EGCG is an antioxidant–rich green tea extract. While the pill form may not be as effective as drinking actual green tea, taking a 400 milligram supplement can still offer health benefits, such as anti–aging.
</li><li><b>Resveratrol Supplement</b>: Resveratrol, found in grapes and red wine, is beneficial for cardiovascular health and anti–aging. Leo suggests a 200 milligram supplement form to gain these benefits without the downsides of alcohol consumption.
</li><li><b>Astaxanthin Antioxidant</b>: Leo discusses the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin, sourced from salmon or algae, and recommends it for its overall health benefits, including a rumored resistance to sunburn. He takes a high dose of 12 milligrams in supplement form.
</li><li><b>Essential Minerals and Vitamins</b>: Leo lists essential minerals and their bioavailable forms, such as copper, zinc picolinate, a K2 complex supplement containing vitamin K1 and K2, and manganese, implying their importance in a balanced supplement regimen. He also mentions mega fulonic as a preferable bioactive form of folic acid.
</li><li><b>Iron with Caution</b>: Iron supplements should be taken with care to avoid cancer risks. Leo notes that while women may need supplementation due to menstruation, men typically do not unless there's heavy bleeding. He prefers a bioavailable form, Ferro gel.
</li><li><b>Rhodiola and Selenium</b>: Rhodiola is an adaptogenic herb praised for smoothing out cortisol levels and enhancing stable energy levels, while selenium is a necessary element that shouldn't be overdosed. Leo takes 200 micrograms of selenium daily.
</li><li><b>Pterostilbene & Vitamin B6</b>: Leo mentions terostilbene, a compound from red grapes that may be more beneficial than resveratrol, and the most bioavailable form of Vitamin B6 (P 5 P).
</li><li><b>Bioavailable Curcumin</b>: Leo highlights super bio curcumin, derived from turmeric, for its potent anti–cancerous properties and its design for high bioavailability to ensure the body absorbs it efficiently.
</li><li><b>Super Bio Curcumin</b>: A patented form of curcumin designed for high bioavailability, with as much as 80% to 90% absorption, therefore worth investing in despite a higher cost.
</li><li><b>Host Defense Mushroom Blend</b>: A Paul Stamets–recommended mixture of 15 exotic mushrooms, including maitake, reishi, lion's mane, and shiitake, believed to support the immune system and potentially aid in recovering from colds more quickly.
</li><li><b>Extra Strength Ginkgo Biloba</b>: A traditional herb for enhancing mental function and memory, especially important to Leo as he values cognitive performance improvements.
</li><li><b>Huperzine A</b>: Another brain–supportive supplement aimed at improving learning and memory which may be of interest for cognitive enhancement.
</li><li><b>Acetyl L–Carnitine</b>: A brain–function supplement providing 500mg tablets that help the brain operate more smoothly for sharper and clearer thinking.
</li><li><b>Beta Glucan</b>: A complex polysaccharide from baker's yeast that supports the immune system, interestingly used in the agricultural industry to keep livestock healthy enough for production.
</li><li><b>Gymnema Sylvestre</b>: A herb used by Leo to help with glucose metabolism and reduction of sugar cravings, particularly effective when adhering to a strict paleo, low–carb diet.
</li><li><b>Supplement Costs and Considerations</b>: Supplements can get expensive, costing about $140 per month; Leo advises against unnecessary expenses unless there's good reason or evidence for the health benefits.
</li><li><b>Recommended Basic Supplements</b>: Leo suggests that not everyone needs to go deep into biohacking but recommends omega–3, high–quality vitamin C, maca for bedroom happiness, vitamin D3 for overall shortage, vitamin A for eye health, and astaxanthin for its potent antioxidant properties. Magnesium is also suggested for its benefits in digestion.
</li><li><b>Importance of Research and Quality</b>: It's crucial to do thorough research on each supplement, understand its purpose, and look for high–quality, bioavailable, and well–reviewed options, despite limited scientific evidence for many supplements.
</li><li><b>Holistic Well–being and Actualized.org</b>: Emphasizes that actively maintaining one's health is vital for living an extraordinary life both mentally and physically. Promotes his website, actualized.org, which focuses on personal development, and offers a free newsletter with exclusive content and a chance to win free coaching.
