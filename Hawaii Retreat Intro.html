            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of the retreat location and cost</b>: Leo is at a new Airbnb location in a jungle on the Big Island of Hawaii, near Hilo. He describes the sunny weather and the natural surroundings, including wildlife. The accommodations cost is about $100 per night with an $800 flight from Las Vegas to Hawaii.
</li><li><b>Description of living spaces</b>: Leo tours the rented house, mentioning unused areas like a downstairs bar, and focuses on the second floor where he spends his time. This includes the kitchen, dining, balcony with a meditation bench, living room, and his preference for open windows due to the pleasant climate.
</li><li><b>Food preparation for retreat</b>: Leo details his assortment of food supplies for 10 days, including various fruits, vegetables, eggs, bacon, and rice, acknowledging some unhealthy choices due to local shopping limitations. He shows the food storage in his kitchen and emphasizes practicality over strict health during the retreat.
</li><li><b>Leo's intention for a deeper retreat</b>: He aims for a deeper retreat experience by adjusting his daily techniques, including EEG brain training, yoga, and the use of psychedelics such as five Meo. Leo plans to avoid nightly update videos for a more immersive retreat, with a summary video at the end.
</li><li><b>Daily retreat practices</b>: The routine involves daily brain training, yoga, mindfulness, and contemplation, followed by five Meo use each night. Leo also plans to incorporate shamanic breathing to work through emotional blockages and facilitate profound existential investigation.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on process over distractions</b>: Leo speaks about the double–edged nature of retreating in a beautiful location, resolving to remain focused on his practices despite the temptations of Hawaii's pleasant environment. He explains the importance of dedication and mindfulness throughout the retreat for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Commitment to continuous practice</b>: Leo is dedicated to staying within the house for nine days, engaging in hour–long meditation sessions throughout the day, aiming for 10 to 12 sessions each day, while maintaining mindfulness during all activities.
</li><li><b>Deepening mindfulness through persistence</b>: As the retreat progresses, Leo explains that the continual practice builds upon itself, leading to increased mindfulness and the potential for profound mystical experiences, samadhi, and awakening experiences.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing the difficulty of retreats</b>: He candidly discusses the intensity of the retreat, stressing it is not a vacation but hard work that's emotionally taxing and challenges his ego, dispelling any romantic notions viewers might have.
</li><li><b>Real work versus passive learning</b>: Leo differentiates between the deep work done on retreats and the less involved learning from self–help materials or online videos, urging viewers to experience a solo retreat to understand the true depth of suffering and transformation involved.
</li><li><b>Facing personal challenges</b>: The retreat brings to the surface inner demons, personal failings, cravings, and egoic resistances, which he acknowledges can provoke a strong desire to escape into distractions or seek comfort from others.
</li><li><b>Staying focused amidst loneliness and temptation</b>: Success in the retreat requires facing loneliness and fears head–on, avoiding the trap of distractions, and dealing with arising psychological baggage with mindfulness.
</li><li><b>The grueling nature of the process</b>: Leo describes the retreat as a test of patience and focus, with lengthy periods of meditation that can be tedious and boring, advising to take the process one step at a time and remain in the present moment.
</li><li><b>Building momentum with practice</b>: Acknowledging the need for extensive hours of technique practice to reach significant breakthroughs, Leo emphasizes the importance of perseverance and a beginner's mind in the pursuit of deeper realization and insight.
