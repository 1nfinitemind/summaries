            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4VNoe5tn3tg' target='_blank'>What Is God - Leo Becomes Absolute Infinity (Aka God) - All Of Reality Explained</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's summary of the video purpose</b>: Leo aims to convey his experience of becoming conscious of absolute infinity and his transformation into what he describes as God. He promises to demonstrate, in a subsequent episode, how viewers can gain this insight swiftly, within 15 minutes.
</li><li><b>Discovery of a unique psychedelic</b>: Leo recounts his research into psychedelics and discovery of a rare substance that induces a complete loss of ego while retaining mental clarity, distinct from traditional psychedelics that create visual and spiritual effects.
</li><li><b>Redefining the ego and experiencing non–existence</b>: He ponders the paradigm shift that would occur if one's ego ceased to exist. Leo questions the nature of reality and existence when the self is completely absent.
</li><li><b>Leo's personal stance on divinity</b>: Despite his fundamentally atheistic and rational approach to life, Leo refrains from using the term 'God' due to its cultural implications but finds himself doing so after his ego–dissolving experience.
</li><li><b>Leo's initial skepticism towards psychedelics as distortions of reality</b>: Leo enters his psychedelic experiment with the preconception that these substances create false experiences, only to encounter an earth–shattering insight that challenges his belief.
</li><li><b>Leo's experience upon taking the psychedelic</b>: Describes the rapid intensification of consciousness and awareness upon ingestion, which led to an altered perception of reality that defied logic and physics.
</li><li><b>Experiencing absolute infinity and becoming God</b>: Leo narrates the profound moment he became aware of the absolute infinite nature of reality, resulting in the complete transformation of his life, where he realized he and God are one and the same.
</li><li><b>Surprise over the use of 'God' label</b>: Observes his own unexpected use of the term 'God' throughout the experience and elaborates on the concept of absolute infinity that transcends mathematical or geometric notions, embodying all dimensions and possibilities.
</li><li><b>Explanation of Absolute Infinity</b>: Leo delves into the concept of absolute infinity, not just as a mathematical or geometric term but as a reality comprising of infinite dimensions where every possibility, even the impossible and non–existent, is encompassed and perpetually expanding without bounds.
</li><li><b>Limits within Reality</b>: Discusses that reality, being inclusive of everything, does not allow for any limits, such as physical laws or constants. These perceived limits or structures of the universe, if they exist, are simply aspects within the boundless possibility field of reality, which itself cannot be enforced by anything external since it is all–encompassing.
</li><li><b>Alternate Universes Concept</b>: Uses the metaphor of moving a grain of sand to imagine an alternate universe, expanding this idea to shifting every particle in our universe and considering all potential universes across time. Even this, however, is only a small glimpse of true absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Qualities of Absolute Infinity</b>: Describes absolute infinity as not having sensory attributes but as an existence that can only be perceived directly by being it. It is an endless singularity containing all of existence, including time, which is merely one dimension among countless others.
</li><li><b>Awakening from Life</b>: Leo shares a narrative illustrating the profoundness of awakening from life, likening it to unzipping and shedding an ego–bound existence to emerge as absolute infinity, a shocking and indescribable transition that reveals the true concept of the ego.
</li><li><b>Understanding Awakening and God</b>: Emphasizes that true awakening and the concept of God can only be understood through direct experiences far beyond human comprehension or expectation, with 'God' becoming a suddenly appropriate term during this revelation.
</li><li><b>Chemicals Inducing the Experience of God</b>: Reflects on the impossibility of becoming infinite through chemical means, as conventional understanding would suggest, and how this experience challenges every known aspect of reality, declaring his prior understanding and teachings as part of a delusional dream.
</li><li><b>The Infinite Beauty of Absolute Infinity</b>: Describes experiencing absolute infinity as encountering pure, raw beauty filled with awe and fear, radically shifting one's perception and awakening a profound realization of the scope of one's own delusion.
</li><li><b>Capturing the Essence of the Experience</b>: Leo likens the awe–inspired feeling of viewing the night sky to his psychedelic experience, stating that multiplying that feeling by infinity falls short of capturing the profound impact of his encounter with absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Full–Body Transformation</b>: Emphasizes that the experience was a complete physical and emotional transformation, releasing a lifetime's worth of emotional struggle and leaving an indelible mark on his entire being.
</li><li><b>Post–Experience Integration</b>: Leo discusses his return to normalcy after the chemical's effects subsided but acknowledges the permanent shift in his perception of reality, leading to an ongoing effort to reconcile his limited ego with the concept of absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Hypothesizing Reality's Nature</b>: Posits that reality is an infinite matrix within infinite dimensions where every possibility occurs simultaneously, suggesting the necessity of limited perspectives, like individual egos and our specific universe, for absolute infinity to truly be infinite.
</li><li><b>Finding Satisfaction in a Philosophical Explanation</b>: Shares a sense of satisfaction in having his existential questions addressed by understanding the encompassing nature of absolute infinity, which includes both life's pleasant and horrendous aspects.
</li><li><b>Life–altering Power of a Single Experience</b>: Leo attests that the transformative power of this single experience surpasses years of meditation and self–inquiry, asserting its unparalleled significance in his personal development.
</li><li><b>Reacting to Life's Futility Post–Awakening</b>: Expresses a realization of the futility of everyday life goals compared to the awakened state, which offers a complete perspective where everything is understood as a mere distraction from infinite reality.
</li><li><b>Contrast between Fear and Awakening</b>: Highlights that our limited understanding due to fear of loss prevents us from awakening to the infinite existence that's possible if we let go of our attachments.
</li><li><b>Recurring Realization of Godliness</b>: Describes subsequent experiences in sleep where he would recall becoming absolute infinity, resulting in awakening from sleep overwhelmed by the memory's beauty and terror.
</li><li><b>The Imposing Nature of God</b>: Comments on the overwhelming nature of experiencing God, implying that despite its beauty, its magnitude can be terrifying, leading to a cautious approach to repeated experiences.
</li><li><b>Awaiting Next Episode for Revelation</b>: Teases the revelation of the substance and detailed instructions for safe use in the next episode, urging viewers to keep an open mind and stay tuned for more information.
