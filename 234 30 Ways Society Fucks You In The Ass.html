            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/z4YkMoysymY' target='_blank'>30 Ways Society Fucks You In The Ass</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Modern Capitalism and the Graves Model</b>: Leo explains that modern capitalism, or 'stage Orange' in the Graves model, means businesses shape culture, government, science, religion, and other societal aspects. 
</li><li><b>Businesses Architecting Systems</b>: He articulates that businesses craft systems to trap people's 'lower selves', optimizing them for profit at the expense of higher consciousness engagement.
</li><li><b>Entrepreneurial Ignorance and Neurosis</b>: Leo points out that leaders of businesses, while crafty and intelligent, remain ignorant and stuck in the low consciousness patterns they foster in consumers for financial gain.
</li><li><b>War for Attention</b>: The current business environment is described as a battleground for consumer attention–'eyeballs'–which equates to power and money necessary for businesses to survive.
</li><li><b>Marketing's Appeal to Primal Instincts</b>: Leo lists primitive instincts or 'chimp parts' such as cravings for sugar, salt, and fat, sex, power, status, entertainment, validation, security, comfort, and love (in a lower self form) that marketing strategies directly target.
</li><li><b>Ego–driven Business</b>: He identifies an ego–driven cycle where business leaders use their egos to exploit consumer egos, detailing how businesses market products by activating consumers' primal drives.
</li><li><b>Unhealthy Mainstream Culture</b>: Leo criticizes mainstream culture across various industries–food, alcohol, drugs, education, celebrity, literature, video games, TV, news, social media, fashion, and technology–for promoting lower self behavior detrimental to health and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Consumer Items as Temporary Band–Aids</b>: Gadgets and items like Fitbits, bought during festive seasons like Christmas, are criticized as temporary and serve as examples of manipulation that feed into lower 'chimp–like' desires under the guise of progress.
</li><li><b>Lower Self Exploitation in Financial Services</b>: The financial industry, especially credit loans, mortgages, and credit cards, uses celebrity endorsements in advertising as a means to exploit the consumer's desire for easy gratification without the hard work.
</li><li><b>Nightclubs as 'Chimp Zoos'</b>: Nightclubs are likened to zoos for chimps, where primitive desires are indulged in a controlled environment, thus appealing to base instincts through an atmosphere of dance and music.
</li><li><b>Car Ownership as an Identity Symbol</b>: The obsession with sports cars or luxury vehicles, and the need to possess them is described as a foolish preoccupation that is symptomatic of a deeper lack of self–awareness.
</li><li><b>Holidays Driven by Marketing</b>: The commercial exploitation of holidays, such as Christmas or Valentine's Day, is presented as another form of appealing to one's lower self through aggressive marketing and consumerism.
</li><li><b>Politics as Primal Conflict</b>: Political discourse is compared to primitive confrontations between groups of chimps, suggesting that it is inherently low in consciousness and more about conflict than constructive dialogue.
</li><li><b>Religion Described as Pretentious Pageantry</b>: Religion is critiqued as a performance, particularly the elaborate displays of authority and grandeur, which are old practices designed to impress and distract from true personal growth.
</li><li><b>Marriage as a Distraction from Self–Development</b>: Modern marriage is shown to delude individuals into thinking they are avoiding personal growth by finding comfort in partnership, thus replacing the pursuit of truth with a temporary sense of security.
</li><li><b>Romance as a Lower Self Appeal</b>: The narrative of romance promoted by society is claimed to be an escape that exploits primal desires rather than a meaningful pursuit of love.
</li><li><b>Family Dynamics as Low Consciousness</b>: Family life is criticized for being unconscious and functioning like a group of chimps engaged in their own patterns and dysfunctions, thus avoiding genuine understanding or relationships.
</li><li><b>Career Pursuits as 'Chimp' Tasks</b>: Standard 9–to–5 jobs are judged to be driven by 'chimp–like' motives, focusing on survival rather than impact, leading to an unaware life driven by consumerism.
</li><li><b>Stock Market and Financial Sector Critique</b>: The financial sector, such as Wall Street, is accused of preying on lower self desires, with its culture of appearances and materialism overshadowing true personal and societal development.
</li><li><b>Professional Sports as Low Consciousness Entertainment</b>: Loyalty to sports teams and the massive industry of professional sports is dismissed as one of the clearest forms of low consciousness, inciting tribalism and distraction rather than self–awareness or constructive engagement.
</li><li><b>Acknowledgment of Societal Trap Participation</b>: Leo admits his own past entrapment in society's pitfalls and emphasizes the effort required to extract oneself from these patterns and awaken to the higher aspects of oneself.
</li><li><b>Path of Least Resistance and Business Traps</b>: Leo describes the path of least resistance as the place where businesses set their traps, akin to how hunters lay traps along the paths frequently used by deer. He likens this to how society tempts individuals with easy, unhealthy options in mainstream culture, including food, entertainment, media, news, and shopping, which are detrimental to our physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual well–being.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org's Participation in the Game</b>: Leo acknowledges that even though Actualized.org aims to promote authentic living, it too must participate in the 'game' of attracting attention on platforms such as YouTube. This is necessary for survival in the current business environment, though he assures that the intentions are genuine and not part of an evil conspiracy.
</li><li><b>Ignorance, Ego, and Distraction in Society</b>: He points out that ignorance, ego, and distraction are the real issues plaguing society, not malevolent scheming. Many CEOs and entrepreneurs, especially those in Silicon Valley, are unaware of their neuroses and work compulsively until they face significant health problems, while some eventually seek to find their authentic selves.
</li><li><b>Balance of Modern Business</b>: Leo acknowledges the benefits of modern business, which offers valuable services and freedoms not available in the past. He encourages using the tools and opportunities provided by these businesses to further personal growth and authentic living.
</li><li><b>Taking Life Back with Authentic Living</b>: Leo urges viewers to commit to living authentically, which may require bold moves and renouncing distractions like pornography, video games, drugs, politics, and sports. This commitment is a step towards finding one's self and pursuing psychological health.
</li><li><b>Detox and Contemplation for Growth</b>: He recommends taking a week–long solitary retreat to detox from daily routines and media, allowing space for meditation and contemplation of life. This time of being alone can lead to personal insights, the establishment of new habits, and significant life decisions.
</li><li><b>Implementation of Life Changes</b>: Leo stresses the importance of taking concrete steps towards self–discovery and contentment. He advises viewers to implement changes, reflect, and possibly alter the direction of their lives, emphasizing that theory is insufficient without action.
</li><li><b>Promise of Transformation</b>: Finally, Leo promises that viewers who act on his advice will experience profound life transformation over the course of five to ten years, achieving personal development that once seemed unreachable. He stresses the importance of ongoing action and engagement with Actualized.org's content to maintain progress on the self–actualization journey.
