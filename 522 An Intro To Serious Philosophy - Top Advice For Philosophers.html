        <p><em>There is only one serious philosophical question, which is: What is<br />
Consciousness?<br />
And that is because, Consciousness is all there is.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to the episode</strong> : Leo shares that this video will offer invaluable advice on how to engage with philosophy seriously. He intends to provide a lifetime of tips to help save years of effort for aspiring philosophers. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical background</strong> : Leo describes his personal journey in philosophy, starting in his mid-teens through university and onwards, highlighting a self-taught approach that led to a deep understanding and a successful career. </li>
<li><strong>Meta philosophy</strong> : Leo introduces the concept of meta philosophy, reflecting on the methods and processes of doing philosophy correctly, including questioning the correctness of philosophical practices. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as a quest for absolute truth</strong> : He boldly claims that he used philosophy to achieve an absolute understanding of reality, a claim contrary to traditional academic views of philosophy as endless debate. </li>
<li><strong>Personal story and introduction to philosophy</strong> : Leo recounts his childhood experiences discussing existential topics with his family, sparking his deep curiosity about stars, evolution, technology, and the nature of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Animal consciousness and human arrogance</strong> : Questions about animal consciousness led Leo to ponder human biases and the level of understanding animals might possess compared to humans. </li>
<li><strong>Levels of consciousness</strong> : Reflecting on the varying degrees of consciousness in animals, Leo considers the limitations of a mouse or an ant's awareness of reality and extrapolates this to question how much humans truly understand. </li>
<li><strong>Leo Gura's inquisitive nature</strong> : From a young age, Leo was fascinated by deep existential topics, engaging in spirited family discussions on philosophical and existential questions during road trips. </li>
<li><strong>Passion for existential dialogue</strong> : He discovered his passion for life was ignited by these profound conversations, more so than any other activity, a realization that guided him towards his life's purpose of seeking understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Debates on religion and God</strong> : In high school, Leo's dialogues with a devoutly religious friend led him to contemplate the nature and existence of God, sparking an interest in epistemology and the foundational aspect of how we know what we know. </li>
<li><strong>Early philosophical explorations</strong> : His first philosophical book was an encyclopedia of philosophy, leading him to ponder various philosophical schools and their conflicting views. He aimed not just to know philosophy but to understand the truth about reality itself. </li>
<li><strong>Contemplating reality and belief systems</strong> : Leo spent many late nights contemplating reality's nature, which led him to realize that all belief systems, including science and religion, are ultimately groundless and circularly justified. </li>
<li><strong>Skepticism and the quest for understanding</strong> : Resonating most with skepticism, or pyrrhonism, he questioned the very possibility of knowing anything about reality, leading to an exceedingly skeptical and uncertain standpoint. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in philosophy</strong> : The challenge of writing a philosophy book and the realization of the inherent limitations within his system led to a struggle to create something positively constructive about reality. </li>
<li><strong>Insights into academic philosophy</strong> : University study and research into becoming a professional philosopher revealed the limitations and bureaucracy of the academic system, which he saw as corrupt and not conducive to the pursuit of true philosophy. </li>
<li><strong>Rejection of academia and transition to video game design</strong> : Leo chose integrity over compromise, rejecting a career in academia for independent pursuit of philosophy and transitioning to video game design, seeking a creative path without external influence. </li>
<li><strong>Achieving Financial Independence</strong> : Leo Gura focused on building a business to secure financial autonomy, enabling him to pursue his interests without financial constraints. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Education and Personal Development</strong> : Upon gaining financial independence, Leo immersed himself in self-education, reading non-fiction and exploring personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Neglected Aspects of Personal Life</strong> : Leo admits that his intense focus on understanding reality led him to overlook relationships and dating until his mid-20s. </li>
<li><strong>Introduction to Pickup and Practical Philosophy</strong> : While improving his dating life, Leo was introduced to philosophical concepts through Owen Cook's teachings, which reignited his passion for philosophy and influenced the foundation of Actualized.org. </li>
<li><strong>The 'Most Dangerous Book' and Enlightenment</strong> : A forum post led Leo to read 'Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing' by Jed McKenna, which impacted him profoundly, teaching him about enlightenment and reshaping his view of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Link Between Early Contemplation and Enlightenment</strong> : The concept of enlightenment resonated with Leo's past deep contemplations on epistemology and the groundless nature of beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Diverse Developments in Gura&rsquo;s Life</strong> : After becoming a life coach and delving into meditation, Leo launched Actualized.org while researching philosophy, personal development, psychology, and observing interconnections among these domains. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment and Experiences Beyond Conventional Reality</strong> : During a vipassana retreat, Leo had a sober enlightenment experience that revealed a new dimension to reality. Psychedelics further expanded his understanding of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Claim of Achieving Omniscience</strong> : Through extensive practice in various disciplines, Leo claims to have reached a complete and absolute understanding of existence, which he calls 'omniscience.' </li>
<li><strong>Critique of Western Philosophy and Universities</strong> : After achieving 'omniscience,' Leo perceives traditional Western philosophy and academia as deeply flawed and incapable of leading to the true aim of philosophy. </li>
<li><strong>Leo&rsquo;s Philosophical Journey as a Blueprint for Aspiring Philosophers</strong> : Sharing his journey, Leo aims to provide insights for those interested in philosophy to see if his path resonates with them. </li>
<li><strong>The Innate Drive for Philosophy</strong> : Leo emphasizes that philosophy should be pursued out of an insatiable curiosity and a love for pure understanding for its sake. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy&rsquo;s Fundamental Role and Value</strong> : He considers philosophy to be the root of all knowledge, more fundamental than science, and essential for deeply questioning reality beyond what is commonly accepted. </li>
<li><strong>The Meaning and Depth of Philosophy</strong> : For Leo, the depth one finds through philosophical inquiry is the most meaningful aspect of life, distinguishing profound thinkers from those occupied with superficial pursuits. </li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Philosophy</strong> : The core of philosophy is relentless questioning, which enables the discovery of profound truths about reality. It's a process of inquiry that can lead to legitimate answers, rather than just speculation or ideology. </li>
<li><strong>Human Advantage in Questioning</strong> : Humans uniquely possess the ability to question reality deeply, a trait that separates us from other species like mice, which likely do not possess this function. This capability is not merely linguistic but can lead to substantive understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning as a Superpower</strong> : Asking questions is a superpower most people underutilize. Philosophers, by contrast, master the art of deliberate and deep questioning, which can lead to transformative insights and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Artful Questioning</strong> : Leo encourages viewing questioning as an art form to be cultivated, rather than a tool invoked only for pragmatic or self-serving purposes like acquiring sex or wealth. </li>
<li><strong>Sample Philosophical Questions</strong> : Leo lists various intriguing and diverse philosophical questions to stimulate curiosity and encourage personal inquiry into fundamental existential topics. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy's Suitability</strong> : Philosophy is appropriate for those who possess an insatiable curiosity about fundamental existential questions and find joy in seeking pure understanding and engaging in profound discussions. </li>
<li><strong>Fields of Philosophy</strong> : Philosophy includes diverse areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and morality, aesthetics, political philosophy, philosophy of science, logic and mathematics, religion, philosophy of mind, psychology, sociology, history, spirituality, mysticism, and philosophy of language. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy Requires Work and Genuine Insights</strong> : Effective philosophy is distinguished from mere speculation through genuine observation and insights. It requires an open and unbiased mind, free from preconceived notions and cultural programming. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning vs. Assumptions</strong> : Philosophy is about questioning the nature of reality rigorously, rather than clinging to speculations or beliefs. To do philosophy effectively, one must be willing to question every cultural and ideological assumption. </li>
<li><strong>Open-mindedness in Philosophy</strong> : Philosophers must be radically open-minded and free from biases and cultural programming to observe and understand reality accurately. Confronting even deeply held beliefs such as the shape of the Earth is necessary to safeguard against self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>The Complexity of Fundamental Questions</strong> : Fundamental questions on topics like nature, light, and life which appear simple are deeply complex upon closer examination. Understanding such questions demands extensive contemplation and recognition of their intricate nature. </li>
<li><strong>The Effort in Philosophical Practice</strong> : Philosophy requires the same dedication and practice as mastering any other skill, such as sports or arts. A philosopher must spend thousands of hours deeply questioning and contemplating to develop a genuine understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy and Self-Deception</strong> : Many fall into the trap of convincing themselves they are great philosophers without the necessary practice. To avoid this, one must recognize and address self-deception mechanisms like confirmation bias and projection. </li>
<li><strong>Developing Philosophical Skills</strong> : Effective questioning and thinking skills are not innate; they must be developed. Observation and contemplation, utilising thought experiments, and exploring diverse perspectives contribute to building these essential philosophical skills. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as Improvement of Thinking</strong> : Philosophy aims to improve the quality of one's general thinking across various domains of life, differentiating from specialized thinking in fields like mathematics or engineering. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Work and Observation</strong> : Accomplishing philosophical work involves a balance of contemplation and neutral observation of both external reality and the workings of the mind, leading to deeper understanding and insights. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy and Exploration of Perspectives</strong> : By exploring various perspectives and viewpoints beyond one's own, the philosopher gains a broader understanding and avoids creating an echo chamber of reinforcing self-beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning as a Philosophical Method</strong> : Questioning all assumptions and conducting thought experiments are essential practices for philosophers. It is through powerful questions that one delves deeper into understanding reality. </li>
<li><strong>Integrity and Self-Reflection in Philosophy</strong> : Philosophers must rigorously practice self-reflection to observe and correct their thought processes. Philosophy entails going meta to recognize and rule out biases and ensure honest pursuit of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy Is Not Mere Speculation</strong> : True philosophy extends beyond mere armchair speculation and strives for concrete verification and understanding, distinguishing it from casual guessing, which does not contribute to a genuine quest for truth. </li>
<li><strong>Real Philosophy vs. Armchair Speculation</strong> : Real philosophy involves an active pursuit of truth, such as a flat-earther willing to spend substantial money to personally verify the Earth's shape. This contrasts with those who merely reinforce existing biases without seeking genuine answers. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Integrity and Truth</strong> : The hallmark of a serious philosopher is a deeply honest desire for truth, including the willingness to surrender personally held ideas and admit being wrong, which most people resist due to preference for comfort over truth. </li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Inquiry from Rationalization</strong> : True philosophical inquiry involves active questioning to grasp truths, as opposed to rationalization, where one concocts stories to confirm pre-existing beliefs rather than engage in genuine seeking. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Debating and Critiquing as Philosophy</strong> : Debating, critiquing, and debunking others' philosophies are not true philosophy because they focus on arguing and rationalizing rather than generating new insights and deep personal observation. </li>
<li><strong>History of Philosophy vs. Genuine Inquiry</strong> : Academic philosophy focused on the scholarship of deciphering ancient texts and interpreting past philosophers does not equate to the genuine inquiry required for understanding fundamental questions. </li>
<li><strong>The Pitfalls of Technicalities in Philosophy</strong> : Getting bogged down in technicalities can cause a philosopher to miss the larger picture. Philosophy is about grasping the big picture of existential reality, not just minor technical details. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Personality Cults in Philosophy</strong> : True philosophy is not about admiration for philosophers or their credentials but about the ideas themselves and how deeply one understands the fundamental aspects of reality, self, and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy and Theoretical Escapism</strong> : Using philosophy as a means of escaping practical life challenges is misguided. A grounded philosopher engages with reality, applying philosophical insights to business, relationships, and personal challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Synthesizing Theory and Practice</strong> : Deep theoretical work in philosophy should be balanced with ample practice, allowing practical experiences to inform and ground one's philosophical work, ensuring it does not become disconnected from reality. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy Embodiment</strong> : Genuine philosophy transforms an individual deeply, affecting their emotional system, interactions, self-perception, capacity to love, and overall wellbeing, beyond just theoretical understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy's Impact on Personal Change</strong> : Philosophical inquiry can lead to personal behavior changes as it challenges existing beliefs and habits, making it uncomfortable for many who prefer philosophy as a conceptual rather than transformative tool. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and Consequences in Philosophy</strong> : Engaging in serious philosophy often leads to taking greater responsibility for one's actions and making significant life changes, such as altering diet due to ethical realizations or leaving a job for moral reasons. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy's Threat to Comfort and Status Quo</strong> : The profound insights gained from serious philosophy can be so disruptive that they may lead individuals to question their sanity, as it threatens established lifestyles, careers, and personal relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy versus Political Activism and Power Games</strong> : Philosophy should not be about achieving political goals or engaging in power dynamics but rather about the pursuit of pure understanding, without concern for consequences or gaining power. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Towards Truth in Philosophy</strong> : Leo advocates for a philosophy that is ruthlessly committed to truth, even if it means facing daunting truths that could lead to outcomes like insanity, for the sake of genuine understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Pure Philosophy Defined</strong> : Pure philosophy is unconcerned with historical figures or ideologies, focusing solely on the merit of ideas to understand reality. It requires an infinite open-mindedness and willingness to challenge every assumption, no matter the potential radical consequences. </li>
<li><strong>Core Questions of Pure Philosophy</strong> : The fundamental questions of pure philosophy question the very possibility of existence, understanding what existence means, the origins of the self, the nature of consciousness, and what constitutes a well-lived life. </li>
<li><strong>Complete Understanding as a Philosophical End Point</strong> : Leo claims that with correct practice, philosophy can lead to a complete understanding of oneself and reality, answering every existential question precisely as it exists. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy Is Radical and Dangerous</strong> : In pure philosophy, the pursuit of understanding is prioritized above all else, including societal norms and personal biases. It acknowledges the dangerous nature of this pursuit but continues unflinchingly for the truth. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Overcoming Self-Deception in Philosophy</strong> : Recognizing and transcending personal biases is fundamental in pure philosophy for accurately understanding reality, making self-deception a continual area of focus for the philosopher. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Narrow Specialization in Philosophy</strong> : Leo Gura cautions against getting trapped in the minutiae of philosophy at the expense of missing out on the big, core questions that define the field. He urges philosophers to balance their specific interests with an overarching focus on the fundamental questions of philosophy. </li>
<li><strong>Techniques for Serious Philosophers</strong> : He outlines several critical techniques for philosophers: sitting in solitude and contemplating deeply, improving the ability to ask powerful questions, emphasizing simplicity and clarity to cut through confusion and jargon, and demonstrating the ability to communicate complex concepts simply. </li>
<li><strong>Radical Skepticism and Study</strong> : Leo advocates for radical skepticism&mdash;questioning everything, including one's own ideas and skepticism itself. He also suggests studying a broad range of philosophies to gain an overview of the intellectual landscape. </li>
<li><strong>Open-mindedness and Questioning Science</strong> : Emphasizes the necessity for radical open-mindedness and the importance of questioning scientific assumptions as if they were religious claims, underscoring that serious philosophers should never accept scientific models or ideas at face value. </li>
<li><strong>Use of Psychedelics</strong> : He makes a bold claim that without psychedelics, one cannot understand the true nature of reality, asserting that it is essential for philosophers to engage in psychedelic experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Keeping a Commonplace Book and Meditation</strong> : Advises keeping a commonplace book for notes and quotes, writing down major insights, and engaging in serious meditation practice for inward focus and understanding the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Psychology, Sociology, and Language Mastery</strong> : Stresses the importance of psychology and sociology for understanding the mind's biases and cultural programming, as well as mastering language and articulation to precisely communicate philosophical ideas. </li>
<li><strong>Engaging with High-Quality Minds and Intellectual Dialogue</strong> : Leo recommends engaging in existential conversations and philosophical dialogues with high-quality minds rather than getting involved in ideological debates, which can stifle philosophical growth. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Intellectuals</strong> : Leo recommends avoiding online debates in favor of seeking personal interactions with like-minded people who have an interest in profound existential topics, especially at universities or spiritual circles; using offline, Skype, or in-person meetings for deeper conversations. </li>
<li><strong>Writing Philosophy</strong> : Writing out thoughts and ideas on paper is advised as it helps organize and clarify one's philosophical ideas, making self-deception less likely. </li>
<li><strong>Public Speaking and Teaching Philosophy</strong> : Starting a blog or YouTube channel and joining public speaking groups like Toastmasters can refine and simplify one's philosophical ideas. Teaching philosophy can significantly enhance one's own understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing Philosophy with Practical Life</strong> : Leo insists not to use philosophy as an escape from practical life responsibilities such as jobs and relationships. Developing practical skills alongside philosophical thought is essential. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Dogma in Philosophy</strong> : True philosophy should not be used to defend any particular dogma or ideology; instead, it should pursue truth and be willing to dispense with any pet theories. </li>
<li><strong>Simplicity and Clarity in Philosophy</strong> : Keeping philosophical concepts simple and clear is vital. If one cannot explain their ideas simply to a child, they likely do not fully understand the concepts themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Centrality of Consciousness</strong> : Consciousness is a fundamental concept in philosophy, and understanding it is key to not getting lost in less important philosophical considerations. A direct experience of consciousness is crucial. </li>
<li><strong>Cultivating Open-mindedness</strong> : Being open-minded is crucial in philosophy, as it allows for a wider range of exploration and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Enjoying the Philosophical Process</strong> : Embrace the journey of philosophy; it's not about rushing to an end but about enjoying the process of inquiry and contemplation. </li>
<li><strong>Embodying Philosophy</strong> : Philosophy should not be purely academic; it should be lived out and reflected in one's daily actions and decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Beware of Self-deception</strong> : Self-deception is a significant obstacle in philosophy; being aware of one's own biases is essential for honest inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Practical Insights</strong> : While philosophy often deals with abstract existential questions, it can also offer practical insights that can improve aspects of one's life such as making money, enhancing self-esteem, or fostering happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Be an Original Thinker</strong> : Encourages philosophers to think independently, using ideas from ancient philosophers without becoming attached to their schools of thought. </li>
<li><strong>Prioritize Contemplation Over Reading</strong> : Contemplation is viewed as more beneficial than extensive reading, being a more powerful tool for philosophical insight. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid Attachment to Single Philosophies</strong> : Warns against the entrapment of any one school of philosophy, such as Buddhism, as this can lead to groupthink and dogmatic adherence. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy Should Be Simple and Pure</strong> : Emphasizes the need for focusing on pure ideas and insights rather than getting lost in the complex language of dense technical philosophy. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of Disciplines for Holistic Understanding</strong> : Suggests an omniscient grasp of reality can be achieved by integrating diverse disciplines, including philosophy, science, religion, mysticism, spirituality, self-help, psychology, and sociology. </li>
<li><strong>Use Wikipedia for Philosophical Summaries</strong> : Wikipedia is recommended for quickly grasping the key ideas of philosophers without the need to delve into their dense writings. </li>
<li><strong>Study Self-Help Alongside Philosophy</strong> : Leo advises combining self-help with philosophy to make it more personal, practical, and impacting on one's life. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid Over-specialization</strong> : Stresses the importance of studying the big picture across various fields and philosophies to create an integrated understanding, rather than siloing into over-specialization. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophies Worth Studying</strong> : Lists skepticism, pyrrhonism, idealism, relativism, political philosophy, Eastern philosophies, Zen, Buddhism, Hindu philosophies like Vedanta, and Zogchen as philosophies worth one's time. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophies and Philosophers Worth Studying</strong> : Leo acknowledges the value in studying fields such as mysticism, non-duality, meditation techniques, monism, solipsism, and yoga. Philosophers he regards highly include Heraclitus, Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Plotinus, Sextus Empiricus, Hegel, German idealists post-Hegel (excluding Kant), George Berkeley, Berkeley's namesake, Thomas Nagel, Paul Feyerabend, Willard Van Orman Quine, Spinoza, William James, Stoics like Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, Sri Aurobindo, Ken Wilber, and Peter Ralston. </li>
<li><strong>Overrated Philosophers</strong> : Leo criticizes philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant, post-modernists like Derrida, logical positivists, Wittgenstein, Hobbes, Locke, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Machiavelli, Sartre, Camus, American pragmatists like Peirce, Ayn Rand, Richard Rorty, Confucius, Husserl, and Rousseau. He advises against spending much time studying these philosophers, suggesting Wikipedia summaries as sufficient. </li>
<li><strong>Combination of Philosophies Closest to Truth</strong> : Leo lists idealism, panpsychism, pantheism, monism, non-duality, Zen Buddhism, Vedanta, radical skepticism, Pyrrhonism, holism, relativism, Hindu idealism, solipsism, subjectivism, and phenomenology as elements that, when combined, point closest to absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a Philosophy</strong> : Leo considers his work on Actualized.org, developed with the intention of creating an advanced, sophisticated, and accurate philosophy, as superior to the entire canon of Western philosophy. He invites people to compare his work to traditional philosophical giants. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as Mental Masturbation</strong> : Leo addresses the criticism of philosophy as merely mental masturbation, contending that when practiced properly, it is practical, transformative, and can improve various areas of life such as money-making, relationships, emotional mastery, happiness, and communication. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Aim of Philosophy</strong> : He asserts that the highest goal of philosophy is omniscience, existential understanding, and absolute truth, considering it the most valuable pursuit for a human. Philosophy, he adds, can be used to avoid cultural programming and lead to eventual understanding, love, and breaking free from social constructs. </li>
<li><strong>Cultivation of Mind and Intellect</strong> : Leo expresses immense joy from cultivating his intellect, which brings greater satisfaction than physical pleasures or monetary gains. He emphasizes the beauty of intellect and the potential depth of cultivation. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophies Deemed Incorrect</strong> : He categorizes philosophies such as dualism, atheism, behaviorism, and materialism, among others, as fundamentally incorrect. </li>
<li><strong>Advice Against Academic Philosophy</strong> : Leo recommends against pursuing a career as an academic philosopher within the university system, which he believes does not align with the pursuit of truth. However, he acknowledges that it is possible to have a successful philosophical career outside of academia. </li>
<li><strong>Opportunities in Philosophy</strong> : Opportunities for a career in philosophy exist for those who are endeavoring enough, although it's recognized as being competitive. </li>
<li><strong>Age and Philosophy</strong> : Leo Gura believes there's no age limit to start doing philosophy, suggesting starting young is beneficial, while older age lends a different importance to philosophical questions as material pursuits diminish. </li>
<li><strong>Downsides of Doing Philosophy</strong> : Risks of philosophy include turning it into an echo chamber, becoming ideologically deluded, or neglecting practical life aspects like relationships and survival needs. </li>
<li><strong>Starting with Philosophy</strong> : To start with philosophy, study diverse philosophies in summary, decide on questions of interest, engage in independent contemplation, observe mental processes, and be honest about biases and deceptions. </li>
<li><strong>Transforming Power of Philosophy</strong> : Philosophy must be transformative, leading to a deep understanding that goes beyond being human and towards transcending death. </li>
<li><strong>Recommended Resources</strong> : Leo directs listeners to "How to Discover What's True," his science deconstruction series, and an upcoming episode on 'bootstrapping' to further understand serious philosophical work. </li>
<li><strong>Exploration on Actualized.org</strong> : Actualized.org offers resources for philosophers, including a blog with philosophical insights, book reviews, a life purpose course, and upcoming profound courses. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Depth at Actualized.org</strong> : Leo claims Actualized.org is currently the deepest source of philosophy available and urges individuals to actively engage with the content there to realize its profound impact. </li>
<li><strong>Future Philosophical Endeavors</strong> : Leo plans to publish a significant philosophical book and a new course introducing 'Awakening to alien intelligence', promising to offer insights beyond traditional spiritual teachings.</li>
