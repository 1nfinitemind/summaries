        <ul>
<li><strong>Luck in historical success</strong> : Leo notes that reading biographies might suggest some extraordinary individuals encountered unique circumstances that facilitated their success, leading many to feel they lack the same luck. </li>
<li><strong>Personal anecdote on ambition and doubt</strong> : Leo shares from his college days aspiring to be an aerospace engineer with dreams of working on major space projects, expressing doubts about the rarity of such opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Common doubts in pursuing big dreams</strong> : He explains that people pursuing significant ambitions often worry about the unlikelihood of achieving their aims, which can range from becoming a millionaire to a top entertainer or politician, given the scarcity of such successful positions. </li>
<li><strong>Luck as an average factor</strong> : Leo believes luck balances out for the average person over time, with good and bad luck evening each other out and major successes or failures due to luck being exceptionally rare. </li>
<li><strong>The mastery mindset for success</strong> : He advocates for a mastery mindset over relying on luck, emphasizing that success usually stems from consistent effort and skill development, as exemplified by figures such as Mozart and Tiger Woods. </li>
<li><strong>Opportunity Seizing vs Luck</strong> : Leo makes the point that while it may appear that successful people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett were lucky, in reality, they seized the unique opportunities of their time. Their success was not due to luck but due to preparing for and taking advantage of opportunities that came their way. </li>
<li><strong>Mastery through Dedicated Practice</strong> : Leo emphasizes the necessity of investing substantial time in mastering a skill or field, suggesting that 10,000 to 20,000 hours of dedicated practice can lead to excellence. This mastery can draw opportunities that others might attribute to luck. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of a One-Avenue Success Strategy</strong> : Leo advises against putting all efforts into a single path for success, like trying to win American Idol or create the next Microsoft, which are highly competitive with limited chances for success. </li>
<li><strong>Multiple Avenues for Success</strong> : By contrast, Leo encourages setting goals with many paths to success, such as becoming a millionaire. He suggests there are numerous ways to achieve this goal, which can increase the likelihood of success by offering various opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Adaptability in Pursuing Goals</strong> : Leo points out the importance of being flexible and willing to adapt when pursuing long-term goals. He illustrates this with the flexibility of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, who evolved their businesses in response to opportunities rather than being rigidly fixed to their initial plans. </li>
<li><strong>Creation vs Competition Mindset</strong> : Leo distinguishes between a creator, who expands the market by introducing new ideas or technology, and a competitor, who contends for limited opportunities. He argues that the creator mindset reduces stress and creates more chances for success. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Business and Success</strong> : Leo shares his personal experience of transitioning from competing in search engine rankings to creating content on YouTube, where he found more satisfaction due to fewer direct competitions and more opportunities to innovate. </li>
<li><strong>Competition in Internet Marketing</strong> : Leo describes his previous venture in internet marketing, where success depended on ranking in the top positions on search engine results pages, particularly Google. This limited number of valuable spots created a highly competitive and stressful environment, focusing more on beating competitors than on creating value. </li>
<li><strong>Transition to a Creator Role</strong> : He contrasts his past experience with his current role, where he feels less competition and more satisfaction. Leo emphasizes how creating content on YouTube allows him to grow the market and carve out a new niche based on his unique style and passion. </li>
<li><strong>Limiting Beliefs and Taking Ownership</strong> : Leo discusses common limiting beliefs that hinder pursuing one's life purpose, advocating for taking ownership of success instead of attributing it to luck. He encourages strategies that minimize randomness and focus on creation over competition. </li>
<li><strong>Seizing Opportunities While Creating</strong> : Leo explains that dedication to one's work opens up chances to seize unexpected opportunities, which requires preparedness and mastery in one's field. He suggests that focusing on creating value independently allows opportunities to emerge naturally over time. </li>
<li><strong>Preparation and the Law of Attraction</strong> : He shares his belief in the principle similar to the Law of Attraction&mdash;when you are fully prepared and know what you want, you'll start to recognize opportunities everywhere. This is not due to luck but due to a shift in mindset, allowing for proper recognition and action on potential prospects. </li>
<li><strong>Cherry-Picking Opportunities with a Long-Term Vision</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of a long-term vision and the ability to cherry-pick the best opportunities out of the many that will present themselves. He asserts this quality problem is a desirable position in life. </li>
<li><strong>Work Ethic Over Luck for Success</strong> : Dispelling the myth that success is down to luck, Leo backs hard work and determination as the key factors in achieving success, particularly when setting ambitious goals such as becoming a millionaire. He explains that serious commitment already puts one ahead of most people. </li>
<li><strong>Pride in Effort and Success</strong> : Successful people, according to Leo, take pride in their personal efforts and dedication over any luck they may have had. He concludes that success is a result of relentless hard work, focus, and consistent action towards one's goals. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement and Mindset Mastery</strong> : In conclusion, Leo calls for engagement with his content and promises to share mindsets needed to master one's life through his newsletter. He underscores the importance of overcoming fears and doubts through adopting empowering mindsets across various areas such as career, business, and personal relationships.</li>
