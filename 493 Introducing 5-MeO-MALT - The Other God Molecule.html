            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/seG-RLxnnQQ' target='_blank'>Introducing 5-MeO-MALT - The Other God Molecule</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Leo presents 5–MeO–MALT as a potent research chemical that may carry more risks than classical psychedelics. He stresses the importance of using it responsibly and highlights its profound potential for spiritual growth and god realization.
</li><li><b>Potency and Discovery of 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Despite the lack of widespread recognition and minimal trip reports, Leo discovered the substantial impact of 5–MeO–MALT. He emphasizes its effectiveness at low doses and warns of its powerful effects, which require careful and knowledgeable use.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing Properties of 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Leo notes that while structurally similar to 5–MeO–DMT, 5–MeO–MALT offers a distinct experience characterized by mild visuals, more color, and a magenta hue. It is described as having a holistic and stable effect on the mind, enabling deep exploration of god consciousness.
</li><li><b>Comparison with 5–MeO–DMT</b>: 5–MeO–MALT, compared to 5–MeO–DMT, offers a gentler entry into god realization with more opportunity for introspection. It allows one to deeply examine the mechanics of reality construction, such as how one creates their birth and conceptualizes science and logic.
</li><li><b>Body Load and Comfort of 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Leo discusses the significant, yet more manageable, body load of 5–MeO–MALT, in contrast to the often uncomfortable sensations caused by 5–MeO–DMT. This greater comfort enables a focus on the contemplative aspects of the experience.
</li><li><b>Metrics for Psychedelics Evaluation</b>: He introduces holism and stability as metrics for assessing psychedelics, explaining that some substances, like 5–MeO–MALT, allow for longer and broader chains of thought, aiding in the contemplation of existential questions, which is conducive to deep spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Personal Evolution with Psychedelics</b>: Leo acknowledges that due to his extensive prior use of psychedelics and inner work, his experiences might be advanced compared to someone new to these substances. Their effects have been altered by previous breakthroughs, which may not match a novice's experience.
</li><li><b>Complex Nature of Psychedelic Experience</b>: He stresses that understanding the nuanced and complex effects psychedelics have on the individual is important, as there are no simple answers or magic pills to attain desired results.
</li><li><b>Administration Methods for 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Leo has tried both vaping and rectal administration (plugging) of 5–MeO–MALT. He prefers plugging due to the reduced risk of overdose and it being less harmful to lungs compared to vaping. He has a video on his blog explaining the plugging technique.
</li><li><b>Dosage Recommendations for 5–MeO–MALT</b>: For vaping, start with 5 milligrams and for plugging, 10 milligrams. Since he's more sensitive, he suggests others may need higher doses (up to 30 milligrams for a solid experience) and stresses starting with low dosages to gauge personal tolerance and reactions.
</li><li><b>No Tolerance Build–Up but Risks of Abuse</b>: Leo points out that 5–MeO–MALT doesn't have a tolerance build–up, but overuse can lead to addiction, mental disorders, and detrimental effects on one's life. Recommends limiting use to once a week to prevent these issues.
</li><li><b>5–MeO–MALT is Not Recreational</b>: He warns that 5–MeO–MALT should be used with serious spiritual intent as it can induce strong experiences of non–duality and one's own imagination constructing the entirety of reality, as well as profound feelings of infinite love.
</li><li><b>Legal Considerations for 5–MeO–MALT</b>: Urges viewers to research the legal status of 5–MeO–MALT in their countries, as laws vary internationally. Leo suggests traveling to countries where its use is legal and stresses taking responsibility for any potential legal risks.
</li><li><b>Comparing 5–MeO–MALT to Other Psychedelics</b>: Leo sees the value in trying various psychedelics as they are like different tools, each providing unique insights, and one shouldn't be discouraged if they can't access a particular substance like 5–MeO–MALT.
</li><li><b>Inevitability of Personal Risk in Exploration</b>: Leo admits that exploring psychedelics comes with inherent risks, and users need to decide if they're willing to assume these risks. He advocates for mindful, strategic risk–taking in the pursuit of spiritual depth and understanding.
</li><li><b>Convergence of Psychedelic Insights</b>: He explains that while each psychedelic experience has a unique depth, there's a convergence toward the same fundamental truths about oneness, god, love, infinity, consciousness, and non–duality, rather than a contradiction among various experiences.
</li><li><b>Different angles of truth exploration</b>: Through various psychedelics like 5–MeO–MALT, one can experience the same essential truth. Multiple substances offer different perspectives and levels of holism, allowing deeper integration of this truth into one's life.
</li><li><b>5–MeO–MALT's transformative impact</b>: Leo emphasizes the miraculous nature of 5–MeO–MALT in enhancing consciousness to a level seldom reachable through traditional practices without dedicating a life to intense meditation.
</li><li><b>Advanced teachings made understandable</b>: With 5–MeO–MALT, one can comprehend deep teachings on reality, God, consciousness, and existence, overcoming psychological barriers and societal beliefs, including scientific materialism and mainstream spiritual teachings.
</li><li><b>No bad trips experienced</b>: Leo shares that in about ten uses of 5–MeO–MALT, he has yet to have a bad trip. He attributes this to preparation and warns that unprepared individuals ("normies") may not have the same positive experiences.
</li><li><b>Importance of purity in substances</b>: Leo advises caution with the purity of 5–MeO–MALT, suggesting that a darker color may indicate impurities and recommends starting with lower dosages while monitoring for any adverse reactions.
</li><li><b>Encouraging sharing of experiences</b>: He invites users to share their trip reports on the Actualized.org forum, contributing to understanding of 5–MeO–MALT's potential and possible therapeutic benefits, likening its profound effects to MDMA's healing properties.
</li><li><b>Personal stance on the substance's safety</b>: Based on his experiences, Leo perceives 5–MeO–MALT as safe and non–toxic, not leading to loss of mental control or bodily coordination, but emphasizes personal responsibility in discerning its effects.
</li><li><b>Discontent with mainstream spiritual teaching</b>: Leo announces a shift in his teaching focus towards psychedelics for awakening, expressing dissatisfaction with non–psychedelic practices's ability to convey the depth of existential understanding he wishes to share.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a direct teaching tool</b>: He advocates for the use of psychedelics as an effective path to grasp deep existential truths, arguing that traditional practices alone are unlikely to provide the same level of understanding for the majority of seekers.
</li><li><b>Direct understanding through psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics like 5–MeO–MALT can quickly lead to profound epiphanies without the need for books, gurus, or teachers–just careful use and an open mind.
</li><li><b>Desire and open–mindedness</b>: The success of using psychedelics for spiritual work hinges on the user's genuine desire to understand and willingness to keep an open mind. Abuse or lack of serious intent can negate the benefits.
</li><li><b>Other spiritual practices</b>: While also recommending meditation, yoga, and self–inquiry, Leo emphasizes that such practices alone are unlikely to lead to the deepest understanding of God and reality, which he believes psychedelics can facilitate.
</li><li><b>Consciousness limitations</b>: Leo criticizes the "baseline normie" state of consciousness as inadequate for comprehending reality, arguing that meditation alone may not sufficiently elevate consciousness to understand the construction of reality using 'God's mind.'
</li><li><b>Importance of psychedelics for teaching spirituality</b>: Going forward, Leo intends to use psychedelics more as a teaching tool to help others realize profound truths about existence, which he feels cannot be fully grasped through meditation alone.
</li><li><b>Legal and responsible psychedelic exploration</b>: He encourages exploring legal options for psychedelic use and emphasizes the importance of responsible behavior to ensure future discoveries and benefits in the field of psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Respect for psychedelics and collective responsibility</b>: Leo urges respect for psychedelics and proper conduct to maintain their potential for societal healing and awakening. Responsible use is both a personal and collective responsibility to not limit access for those who could benefit from psychedelic substances.
