            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/g4i0BYQXYKg' target='_blank'>Understanding Resistance</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Analogy of Mental Resistance</b>: Leo likens mental resistance to electrical resistance; the same way electrical current meets opposition in a conductor, our minds resist thoughts, ideas, and ultimately actions that influence our life choices.
</li><li><b>Examples of Resistance</b>: Common tasks such as work projects, household chores, important conversations, and self–care activities like going to the dentist are all prone to resistance.
</li><li><b>Resistance and High Achievers</b>: Those who self–identify as high achievers often experience more resistance because they create imperatives–shoulds and musts–that conflict with their desires.
</li><li><b>Higher Self vs. Lower Self</b>: Resistance is framed as a conflict between the higher self, which knows what's beneficial, and the lower self, which clings to comfort and avoids risks, much like the dynamic between a disciplined adult and a rebellious child.
</li><li><b>Pressure and Frustration</b>: Imposing strict imperatives and self–discipline can lead to feelings of frustration and grind, even if progress is being made. This can hinder the enjoyment and fulfillment that comes from actions like regular gym attendance.
</li><li><b>Sedona Method for Releasing Emotions</b>: The Sedona Method, an inner game tool involving questioning, is promoted as an effective process to reduce and eliminate resistance tied to emotional blocks.
</li><li><b>Four–Step Sedona Method Process</b>: The process involves feeling the resistance, asking oneself if the feeling could be let go, if the release is desired, and determining when the release will happen. Each step potentially reduces resistance upon completion.
</li><li><b>Requirement for Multiple Cycles</b>: The Sedona Method often needs several repeated cycles on a single instance of resistance for substantial effects to take hold, suggesting an initial period of several cycles for a meaningful decrease in resistance.
</li><li><b>Mental Technique Tool</b>: Leo highlights the importance of persistence with this tool, mentioning that common pitfalls exist but can be overcome with consistent practice and an open mind to its seemingly simplistic nature.
</li><li><b>Resistance Towards the Sedona Method</b>: Leo warns of the irony that one could develop resistance towards the method itself, and advises users to avoid seeing it as another "must–do" task, instead encouraging a balanced approach.
</li><li><b>Effectiveness of the Sedona Method</b>: Despite initial skepticism, using the Sedona Method consistently over time can lead to noticeable powerful effects.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Repetitive Cycles</b>: It's important to complete multiple cycles with the Sedona Method, as resistance often decreases after three to four iterations, potentially leaving the initial feeling of resistance as merely a vague memory.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Resistance to the Sedona Method itself</b>: One can even develop resistance towards using the Sedona Method, which ironically can be overcome by applying the method to that resistance as well.
</li><li><b>Role of Self–imposed Pressure</b>: Placing too much pressure on oneself can create resistance and hinder progress; finding a midway point between harsh discipline and laziness can yield the best results.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Both Sides of Self</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of recognizing the validity of both the higher and lower self for sustainable achievement, rather than letting one dominate the other completely.
</li><li><b>Long–term Gains vs. Short–term Struggle</b>: The goal is to achieve a steady, long–term improvement rather than short–term gains that may lead to a yo–yo effect of inconsistent habits and feelings.
</li><li><b>Avoidance Worsens Resistance</b>: Avoiding feelings of resistance exacerbates the issue, whereas accepting and feeling the resistance can paradoxically alleviate it.
</li><li><b>JUST DO IT Approach</b>: Taking action without overthinking (JUST DO IT method) can successfully overpower resistance, although it doesn't engage with the emotional aspects directly like the Sedona Method does.
</li><li><b>Versatility of the Sedona Method</b>: Unlike immediate action methods, the Sedona Method can be practiced throughout the day and during various activities to gradually lower resistance.
</li><li><b>Learning Resources for Sedona Method</b>: For those interested in delving deeper into the Sedona Method, Leo Gura recommends reading "The Sedona Method" by Hale Dwoskin or exploring resources on sedona.com.
</li><li><b>Practical Implementation Advised</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to immediately start applying the Sedona Method to aspects of their lives they are resisting and consult additional materials to avoid common mistakes.
