    <li><b>Essential points on practicing kriya yoga</b>: Leo Gura highlights that practicing kriya yoga, as with other yoga forms, must be done correctly to avoid common mistakes. He suggests using a specific book that acts as a manual for kriya yoga, which can be found via his book list. To practice yoga properly, one must do it on an empty stomach and maintain a proper diet to optimize energy, cognitive function, and overall system balance. Practices should not be done soon after eating, and performing advanced techniques on a full stomach can be dangerous. The right timing for yoga practice should consider a sufficiently empty stomach, ideally waiting four hours after a meal. It's crucial to be meticulous and disciplined in following yoga routines as designed by spiritual masters who are akin to geniuses in their field. Mixing different schools of yoga or modifying techniques without understanding can lead to confusion, ineffectiveness, and even danger due to the transformative power of these practices. Therefore, it is advised to commit to a single yogic path and follow it rigorously.
</li><li><b>Appreciation of yogic mastery</b>: It is crucial to recognize the high level of consciousness achieved by yoga masters, akin to the difference between a human and an ant. Just as we trust the expertise of professionals such as car engineers or surgeons, we must trust the yogic system and follow kriya yoga instructions rigorously without attempting to innovate or mix with other techniques.
</li><li><b>Commitment to regular practice</b>: To see the benefits of kriya yoga, it's necessary to practice every day, ideally for at least a year, before assessing the results. The process involves building up a stack of techniques, gradually adding new ones, and requires commitment and not just casual dabbling.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness during practice</b>: Performing yoga techniques demands full attention and mindfulness. Any distraction or intellectual skepticism must be set aside to fully immerse in and benefit from the practice. The techniques should be executed with the same focus and seriousness as if one's life depended on it.
</li><li><b>Mindful execution of techniques</b>: When performing yoga techniques, one must deeply focus and mindfully engage with every action, breathing pattern, and visualized element. Distractions and skepticism should be set aside to fully immerse in the practice.
</li><li><b>Significance of silent sitting</b>: The final minutes of a kriya routine, spent in silence, are crucial. This period of stillness is not for passive rest, but for culminating the practice's efforts into a deep, contemplative, one–pointed awareness that prepares one for profound awakening experiences.
</li><li><b>Understanding metaphysics and openness</b>: Yoga practices often come with metaphysical and quasi–religious explanations. Skeptics or strict materialists might struggle with these concepts. Success in yoga requires an open mind and direct experience, rather than dogmatic adherence to any particular philosophy or scientific materialism.
</li><li><b>Readiness for advanced practices</b>: Kriya Yoga and similar high–level spiritual practices necessitate a certain readiness and maturity beyond what conventional self–help offers. These practices are not for casual interest but demand serious commitment and an appreciation for the subtleties of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Adhering to chosen methods</b>: It's important to stick to the prescribed techniques of a particular school or book without synthesizing variations from multiple sources. Trust in a single, consistent method is more effective than attempting to create a personalized combination of practices.
</li><li><b>Commitment to a single yoga system</b>: It is crucial to commit fully to one yoga system or a set of teachings and not attempt to synthesize techniques from different schools or sub–schools which could cause confusion and dilute the effectiveness of the practice. Like a cheetah choosing one antelope to hunt or lions identifying a distinct zebra, being decisive and focused in practice is vital.
</li><li><b>Kriya Yoga for householders</b>: Kriya Yoga is designed to be powerful and efficient, requiring only about an hour of practice each day, making it suitable for those with household responsibilities. Unlike some meditation practices that may demand extensive retreats and hours, Kriya Yoga is tailored to fit into a busy lifestyle without sacrificing significant personal or professional obligations.
</li><li><b>Prioritization and vision</b>: Individuals need to have the right priorities and vision in life, understanding that setting aside time for yoga practice is more beneficial than the pursuit of materialistic pleasures. Leo criticizes the notion of being too busy as a reflection of immaturity and lack of understanding of life's deeper purpose.
</li><li><b>There is no 'best' yoga practice</b>: The concept of the 'best' spiritual technique or yoga school is a distraction; what truly matters is what resonates with each individual based on their personality, lifestyle, and spiritual readiness. Different people may connect with different practices at different times in their lives, and experimentation with full commitment is encouraged to discover what works best for oneself.
</li><li><b>Diversified approach to spirituality</b>: Leo advocates for a diversified approach to spiritual practice, incorporating tools like visualization, self–inquiry, mindfulness, and even psychedelics, rather than strictly adhering to a single path or guru. He acknowledges that this may not align with everyone's beliefs but emphasizes that it's his personal path and may work for others who resonate with his teaching style.
</li><li><b>Timing and consistency in practice</b>: Leo advises against doing kriya yoga when tired or close to bedtime, as the techniques energize the body. Instead, choose a time when alert and with an empty stomach–morning being ideal but afternoon and evening also working. Emphasizing regular daily practice, he suggests committing to at least a year to properly evaluate its transformative effects, highlighting that consistency is key, not sporadic engagement.
</li><li><b>Importance of commitment and vision</b>: Leo stresses the necessity of serious commitment to yoga practice, likening it to mastering an instrument. One must approach it with a strong willingness to learn and a clear vision of why they are undertaking the practice. He warns against merely dabbling in yoga as it might lead to frustration and suggests that a disciplined and rigorous approach will eventually make mastering the techniques achievable.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness and discipline in execution</b>: The techniques must be performed with mindfulness, full attention, and without distractions. Intellectualizing or skepticism during practice detracts from the experience. Mindful execution of every component, such as breath and focus on chakras, is imperative for effective practice. Leo emphasizes the critical role of the silent sitting period at the end of the routine, urging practitioners not to underestimate its significance in the awakening process.
</li><li><b>Embracing metaphysical elements with openness</b>: Addressing the metaphysical aspects of kriya yoga, Leo recommends adopting an open–minded stance towards the non–scientific explanations and language found in the texts. He suggests focusing on direct experience rather than getting hung up on unconventional concepts that may initially seem unbelievable.
</li><li><b>Readiness for advanced practice</b>: He acknowledges that kriya yoga entails advanced practices that require aspirants to be in a certain stage of development and readiness, beyond mere curiosity or the pursuit of materialistic goals. To successfully embark on and persist in such advanced practices, one must have already achieved a significant level of personal growth and self–understanding.
</li><li><b>Adherence to prescribed techniques</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of sticking to the standard kriya yoga techniques as described in the recommended book. While slight variations can be found across different sub–schools or teachings of kriya yoga, he warns against attempting to synthesize these and suggests trust in and adherence to one primary source to prevent confusion and ensure focused, effective practice.
</li><li><b>Single–school focus</b>: Just as a predator singles out one prey in a hunt, practitioners should remain committed to one school of kriya yoga or one yoga practice without mixing techniques from various sources. This focused approach is likened to the distinction between zebras in a herd–standing out clearly with one approach rather than blending multiple methods together.
</li><li><b>Kriya Yoga for daily life</b>: Kriya yoga is tailored for householders, designed to be integrated into regular life without requiring the extensive time commitment associated with some other meditation practices. Leo asserts that sincere daily practice for a reasonable duration can lead to significant spiritual results, and one doesn't need to engage in long retreats or spend numerous hours each day in meditation.
</li><li><b>Personal responsibility in practice</b>: Leo highlights individual responsibility in managing one's time and prioritizing spiritual practice. He criticizes excuses of busyness and misplaced priorities, suggesting that anyone can find time for serious spiritual practice if they understand its importance and value over other materialistic pursuits.
</li><li><b>Experimentation and personal resonance</b>: The 'best' practice is subjective and can vary from person to person. Leo encourages experimentation and finding what resonates personally, acknowledging that one might need to switch techniques or teachers as their path evolves. He reiterates that there is no universal 'best,' as it all depends on individual needs and readiness at a given time.
</li><li><b>Diverse spiritual toolkit</b>: Leo describes his own broad–based approach to spirituality, which includes tools like visualization, self–inquiry, breath meditation, and psychedelics alongside kriya yoga. He acknowledges this eclectic method may not suit everyone, suggesting that different individuals may find their spiritual success through various means, either by focusing on one or diversifying their practice.
