        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/8GjGMWBWWKM' target='_blank'>Aztec Nonduality - Profound Life Lessons From Aztec Philosophy</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Brahman is real;<br />
the world is not real;<br />
Brahman is the world." - Shankara</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aztec Non-duality</strong> : Leo introduces Aztec non-duality which shares similarities with various major religions, emphasizing the dynamic, self-generating essence of the universe called Teotl. He plans to detail this spiritual outlook by citing <em><a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/">an article</a></em> from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, offering an overarching view of spirituality and God from an Aztec perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of Teotl</strong> : Teotl is depicted as an all-encompassing, sacred power that is immanent within and transcendent beyond the universe. It signifies an interconnected cosmos that is ever-generating and regenerating, where every element is both a facet of Teotl and wholly identified with it. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPY1MhJD/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15G38DWF/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-2.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding of Immanence and Transcendence</strong> : Leo clarifies that Teotl represents both the tangible world (immanence) and the formless, overarching unification of the universe (transcendence), a concept paralleled in Christian theology and other spiritual traditions. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/j5BS7c0H/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-4.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process-Oriented View of the Universe</strong> : The universe is described not as a static object but as an ongoing process comparable to a constantly changing waterfall. This view contrasts with static perceptions of the material universe, suggesting a more fluid and dynamic reality. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fyXTjdD6/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-5.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dialectical Polar Monism</strong> : Introducing the idea of dialectical polar monism, Leo explains the universe as a single entity that expresses itself through an endless interplay of opposites such as life and death, or order and disorder, reflecting a balance inherent to the cosmos. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Pf8xkgY2/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-6.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance and the Cycle of Polarities</strong> : The lecture touches on the importance of balance in life, indicating that reality involves navigating between complementary opposites without rigidly clinging to any static point or trying to eliminate one side of a duality. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nhTVkpfc/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-7.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Materialist versus Aztec Metaphysics</strong> : Leo contrasts the materialist notion of an objective, unchanging universe with the Aztec view, which recognizes no static reality but rather an unceasing transformation and renewal of the cosmos&mdash;a principle of impermanence also found in Buddhism. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d01sNpJR/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-8.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d0H1qv5S/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-9.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impermanence and Clinging</strong> : Highlighting the concept of impermanence, Leo warns against clinging to transient aspects of life such as possessions, relationships, and ideologies, advocating for a recognition of constant change as a fundamental quality of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Universality of Aztec Non-duality</strong> : The overall emphasis is on the universal nature of Teotl as a living, sentient cosmic process that is continuously self-transforming, aligning with the non-dual teachings expressed across multiple spiritual traditions. </li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Nature of Reality and Personal Growth</strong> : The constant change and development of all phenomena, including personal growth from childhood, illustrate the continuous flow and transformation characteristic of Teotl. This opposes the human tendency to cling to a static identity or state. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PJGdxqYK/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-10.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dialectical Presentation of Teotl</strong> : Teotl is described dynamically, transcending the dichotomies of being and non-being, order and disorder, and other polarities. This persuasive non-duality is beyond the predication of any specific qualities and manifests as a 'third kind' that is at once both and neither of the dualistic states. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of Non-duality</strong> : Teotl encompasses qualities like male and female, life and death, yet it transcends all such dualities. This presents a paradox for human understanding, which is accustomed to categorizing reality into distinct forms rather than perceiving the non-dual essence. </li>
<li><strong>Teotl's Ontological Indeterminacy</strong> : Nahua metaphysics points to an anti-realist view that rejects the concept of a static, fixed, objective reality. Teotl resembles Kant's noumenon, being the essence beyond all perceivable phenomena. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x19TMq74/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-11.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pantheistic View of Nahua Philosophers</strong> : Nahua philosophy embraces pantheism, the view that all existence is a sacred, interrelated unity identical with the sacred totality of Teotl. This challenges orthodox religious views by dismissing the notion of God as a separate, anthropomorphic being. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/q75kPw7P/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-12.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cosmic Artistry and Shamanic Disguise</strong> : Teotl is seen as a sacred artist, endlessly creating the cosmos in an artistic presentation. The universe is perceived as an ongoing, metaphorical performance of Teotl. Additionally, the concept of 'nahual' implies that the cosmos and its transformations are manifestations of Teotl's shamanic self-masking, illustrating the elusive and ever-changing nature of the divine. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brQp2jRP/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-13.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges in Recognizing God's Presence</strong> : God, the ultimate shapeshifter with no intrinsic form, is compared to a perfectly camouflaged creature in the forest, illustrating the difficulty in recognizing the divine in everyday existence without a cultivated consciousness. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXGVsWQv/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-14.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor of Chameleon for God</strong> : The metaphor highlights God as the ultimate chameleon, perfectly camouflaged within existence. Materialists struggle to find evidence for God because divine presence is intricately integrated into all aspects of reality, requiring conscious recognition rather than empirical proof. </li>
<li><strong>Concepts of God in Various Traditions</strong> : In different religious traditions, God includes both deceptive (like the Christian devil) and transformative traits (shapeshifter), showing that God has a multifaceted character, including both creative (Maya) and deceptive (devilish) aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of Existence According to Nahua Philosophy</strong> : Existence is characterized by three specific illusions: the perception of static entities (like humans or trees), the belief in individual, separate existences, and the apparent opposition of dualities. These are considered deceptions of Teotl, masking the true oneness and dynamic movement of all things. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZKSTzCT5/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-15.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Human Mind's Deceptiveness</strong> : Leo underlines the idea that the human mind is prone to self-deception, shaping our perceptions and creating illusions that hinder our understanding of the universe. He emphasizes the need for self-inquiry and spiritual practice to transcend these illusions. </li>
<li><strong>Wisdom's Role in Realizing Teotl</strong> : Wisdom allows humans to discern Teotl's presence beneath its many disguises. Spiritual practices aim to penetrate the illusion and recognize "Teotl as Teotl," the empty, formless truth behind all forms. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BZDqzxfz/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-16.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Teotl's Metaphysical Attributes</strong> : Teotl embodies a complex set of attributes, functioning as the source, object, and standard of reality, knowledge, and aesthetic value. A dual nature of Teotl as both male and female energy is presented, balancing and sustaining the cosmic rhythm. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MGvwmBYd/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-17.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kXv7Jq4F/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-18.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ht4ch6QF/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-19.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognizing Earthly Life as a Divine Disguise</strong> : Earthly existence is perceived as a dream or illusion, with humans often misled by Teotl's artistic self-disguise. This is not an ontological claim but an epistemic one, emphasizing the deceptive nature of ordinary human perspectives. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L8yRPDjJ/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-20.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wBZpfBfH/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-21.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illusion Versus Ultimate Reality</strong> : Leo explains that while materialists or dualists may see non-duality as a false distinction between illusion and ultimate truth, Nahua philosophy maintains those are identically aspects of the singular reality. This concept underscores the monistic worldview that aligns with the non-dual understanding of existence. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zBh1916h/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-22.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embodiment of Non-duality</strong> : Non-duality must integrate the absolute with relative perceptions, similar to viewing a half-full glass as both half-full and half-empty. The challenge lies in recognizing the unity of these opposing perceptions; there's only one reality that can be seen in different ways based on perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Perception of Teotl as the Sole Reality</strong> : According to Nahua monism, humans can only truly perceive 'Teotl', the ultimate reality. To perceive 'Teotl' directly (De Rey) is to become one with it, rather than seeing it through a veil of perception or as separate from oneself. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4ybRxQJN/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-23.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Misconception of Teotl</strong> : Humans often misperceive Teotl by seeing it under disguise or specific descriptions (De Dicto), such as maleness, death, night, etc. This prevents them from seeing Teotl as it truly is and leads to a misunderstanding of divine reality. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/prttv6M6/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-24.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct and Indirect Perception of God</strong> : There are two modes of perceiving God: indirectly, through descriptive forms which cause delusion, and directly, through a mystical union with God that transcends language and concepts, leading to true knowledge of Teotl. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysical and Epistemological Unity</strong> : To know something fully is to become it, eliminating the subject-object duality. Western philosophy struggles with the hard problem of consciousness because it relies on concepts and categories, while Nahua philosophy suggests direct knowledge through unity. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/v8WshbWF/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-25.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existence on a 'Treacherous Habitat' Earth</strong> : Earthly life is viewed as precariously balanced on a 'slippery earth' full of danger. Moral misstep is likened to slipping on slick ground, causing humans to easily lose balance and suffer misfortune, underscoring the need for guidance. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HszCGzZ6/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-26.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy for Maintaining Balance</strong> : Nahua philosophy is practical, focused on the essential question of how humans can maintain balance in life. This contrasts with the abstract, detached analytical philosophy of the West, emphasizing the need for a practical approach to philosophical wisdom. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jSk025rN/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-27.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applying Philosophy to Real-World Problems</strong> : Actualized.org aims to make philosophy practical by addressing real-world problems like depression, addiction, and career dissatisfaction. The goal is to help individuals live more fulfilling lives through authentic philosophical practice. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Disconnection from True Philosophy</strong> : Many societal and personal problems stem from a collective disconnection from true philosophy, leading to dysfunctional, unfulfilling lives. True philosophy, such as the Nahua's, is vital for addressing issues like war, genocide, and environmental destruction. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing Human Life According to Nahua Philosophy</strong> : Nahua philosophy emphasizes wisdom and balance as crucial for human beings to navigate life. Unlike the pursuit of technology or intelligence, wisdom affords stability amid an impermanent life filled with challenges. Achieving balance is dynamic, like riding a unicycle, and needs to be applied in all facets of life, from business to personal relationships. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wTgdbZVt/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-28.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom as Practical Dynamic Balance</strong> : Wisdom is not about holding static, eternal truths but rather about the skillful balancing of consumption, recognizing that lifestyles should be rooted in indigenous shamanism and connected to the concept of Teotl. Wisdom leads to stability and well-being by guiding actions in a balanced way. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/q79Pc5qv/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-29.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Becoming Wise by Rooting in Teotl</strong> : True wisdom and living a good life, according to all religions, involve becoming deeply rooted in Teotl&mdash;or divine consciousness. Wisdom is not grasping eternal truths but actively maintaining balance across life's various situations. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kg5P7SLq/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-30.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Religion's Role in Connecting with God</strong> : Properly practiced religion should quickly connect people with God through various techniques, leading to inherently moral behavior without the need for rules or commandments. </li>
<li><strong>Four Aspects of Wisdom for Nahua</strong> : Wisdom includes (1) maintaining balance and purity for well-being; (2) adapting and extending the way of life inherited from ancestors; (3) participating in the regeneration and renewal of the cosmos; (4) performing ritual activities that genuinely represent Teotl. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y9YJdzLf/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-31.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YSGcWHpP/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-32.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interdependence and Impact of Human Actions</strong> : Nahua philosophy acknowledges a participatory universe where humans and the cosmos are mutually influential. Human actions contribute to either cosmic harmony or disharmony, reinforcing the importance of an integrated approach to existence. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HnmFR8QG/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-33.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earthy Life and Juvenile Moderation</strong> : While the Nahua recognize earthly life's potential for well-being, they urge moderation in all aspects to prevent imbalance. This reflects their holistic perspective that balance cannot be found in outdated, rigid rules but requires adaptive wisdom specific to the current societal context. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zvk4rDjy/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-34.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3rjsp9T3/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-35.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rootedness in Teotl for an Authentic Life</strong> : Humans have a deep yearning for rootedness, often being misled by appearances of stability in various pursuits. True balance and purity stem from rootedness in Teotl, which contrasts materialistic grounding leading to dissatisfaction and repeat searching. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NfgWxTsm/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-36.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom over Dogmatic Moral Codes</strong> : The Nahua philosophy stresses the ability to balance dynamically rather than relying on a fixed set of moral codes, which can be inadequate and lead to imbalance in a rapidly changing world. Wisdom allows for practical flexibility and is necessary for well-being in complex modern societies. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4PSYn0g/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-37.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rooting in the Absolute Truth</strong> : The only unchanging and absolute truth, which represents stability and well-foundedness in the face of change, is equated with nothingness. This contrasts with the impermanence of language, national identities, norms, and even the human body. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Disconnection from Teotl</strong> : A disconnection from Teotl leads to a scattered, unbalanced, and beastly existence. Humans become lost, intemperate, and vicious, lacking humanity and engaging in deceptions and self-deceptions. This is reflected in various sectors of society such as politics, religion, and business, and in personal relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Force Cannot Instill Consciousness of Teotl</strong> : Coercing or indoctrinating individuals to understand Teotl through dogmatic or ideological means is counterproductive. Genuine consciousness of Teotl cannot be substituted with ideas or beliefs about it; it requires a higher state of consciousness and practice for proper, decent living. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Bnbkr01v/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-38.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Proper Education</strong> : Current education systems fail to prepare individuals to be decent human beings. They should instead teach children philosophy, metaphysics, spirituality, and proper scientific thinking within bounds. The lack of such education contributes to societal and environmental pollution. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Contagion Methods</strong> : The prevalence of materialism and disconnection from Teotl acts like a contagion, spreading through various channels such as the media and influencing different sectors like healthcare and government. Attempts to cure this contagion without proper understanding may exacerbate the problem. </li>
<li><strong>Epistemological Cognition and Balance</strong> : Nahuas view well-grounded stability in cognition as walking in balance on slippery earth. Their concept of truth is non-semantic, emphasizing stability and well-rootedness rather than correspondence or descriptions. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G2wfTTgB/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-39.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Western Intellectual Tradition's Misinterpretation of Truth</strong> : Western philosophy and science often misunderstand the essence of truth, treating it as statements or propositions. True understanding is deeper than language and demands direct insight, which most do not seek, leading to a fundamental disconnection from truth. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/LXtbt4Gx/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-40.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spectrum of Authentic Representations of Teotl</strong> : There is a continuum ranging from authentically embodying and representing Teotl to those poorly rooted in it. The effectiveness and truthfulness of everything, from personal actions to commercial products, are evaluated on this continuum. </li>
<li><strong>Disclosing and Unconcealing Truth Through Entities</strong> : Genuine and authentic entities that are well-rooted in Teotl can reveal the profound truth, providing people with better access to this understanding. Societal institutions need to foster systems that are revealing of Teotl for collective well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Heart Over Head in Knowing Teotl</strong> : True knowledge of Teotl comes through the heart, characterized by a holistic mindset, rather than the left hemisphere of the brain which is logical and demanding. Living from the heart leads to better health, less selfishness, and fulfillment of life's mission through love and wisdom. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RZYy9DcL/395-Aztec-Nonduality-Profound-Life-Lessons-From-Aztec-Philosophy-Image-41.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experiencing Platonic Existential Love</strong> : As one recognizes themselves as Teotl and feels intimately connected with the universe, they relinquish judgment and tribalism, leading to the experience of platonic existential metaphysical love that embraces all as facets of Teotl. </li>
<li><strong>Ineffability of Teotl</strong> : Teotl is ultimately ineffable, a seamless totality unrelated to language, concepts, or categories. True experience of Teotl comes non-rationally and without symbolic or linguistic mediation, as these are merely facets of its disguise. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Limits of Symbolic Consciousness</strong> : Ordinary human consciousness is trapped in a symbolic, conceptual realm, thinking in terms of models and quantifications. One needs non-symbolic consciousness to truly understand Teotl, as it is beyond finite models and symbols. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Art in Presenting Teotl</strong> : Song poems and artistic creation are the highest forms of human artistry that closely imitate Teotl's cosmic creativity. Great art comes from a Teotlized heart and reveals the beauty and truth of Teotl. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Artistic Expression and Life Purpose</strong> : Developing a "Teotlized" heart and engaging in creative activities can improve one's connection to Teotl. Finding one&rsquo;s life purpose in artistic expression is crucial, as creation is a core aspect of Teotl and personal fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Acquiring a Teotlized Heart</strong> : To truly know Teotl, one must lead a balanced, pure, moral, and moderate life, showing respect and humility towards Teotl. Without authenticity and moral righteousness, the knowledge of Teotl remains elusive. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interdependence of Epistemology, Morality, and Aesthetics</strong> : Becoming knowledgeable about Teotl involves not just intellectual understanding but also moral and aesthetic self-improvement, as they are intertwined in living a balanced and beautiful life connected to Teotl. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reciprocal Moral Relationship with Teotl</strong> : Knowing Teotl is part of a moral exchange; moral conduct leads to the merits of wisdom and beauty. This interaction is essential for understanding Teotl, highlighting the interconnectedness of moral behavior and epistemological enrichment. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consequences of Mechanical Morality</strong> : People who try to be good through mechanical means without raising their consciousness often feel guilt and shame. Authentic self-improvement comes from becoming more conscious, leading to a natural desire to live a better life. Morality is crucial for creating a conducive environment for spiritual growth among all community members, not just the deeply dedicated individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Humaneness and Flourishing through Balance and Purity</strong> : Living in balance and purity perfects humanness and leads to flourishing. Conversely, the absence of these qualities degrades humaneness and causes suffering. Teotl, embodying beauty and purity, sets the ultimate standard of value. Virtual connection with Teotl is essential for balance and purity. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beauty in Nature as a Reflection of Teotl</strong> : Observing the natural world, such as peacock tail feathers or animals, can illustrate the beauty inherent in Teotl's design, contrasting with man-made objects that lack symmetry and order, reflecting a disconnection from Teotl. Evolution drives towards higher beauty, consciousness, and balance, aligning with Teotl's principles. </li>
<li><strong>Moral Conduct as Path to Authenticity</strong> : Morally appropriate behavior develops one's authentic human nature, enriches life, and cultivates a good heart. In contrast, morally inappropriate actions leave individuals undeveloped and impoverished. Moderation in all pursuits, as advocated in Buddhist and Aristotelian philosophy, is the key to wisdom and balance. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Health Issues as Byproduct of Lifestyle</strong> : Conditions such as autoimmune diseases, mental illnesses, and heart disease are not merely accidental but result from how individuals live, including diet and mindset. Societal spoilage stems from a collective disconnect from Teotl, leading to an imbalance between oneself and the environment. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Education</strong> : The true aim of education is to cultivate a wise and robust character, instilling the means to maintain balance in life. Modern education fails to provide this, focusing on academic achievements. Still, one can take individual responsibility for their own furthered education in wisdom and authenticity. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Role of Educator and Ritual Activities</strong> : The educator's task is to shape character and foster a connection to Teotl. Addressing issues like addiction requires rituals and techniques that restore balance and purity. Modern society needs new, relevant methods to realign with the heart and Teotl. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interplay of Aesthetics, Morality, and Knowledge</strong> : Aesthetic value correlates with moral and epistemological value. Balance, truth, and purity enhance aesthetic appeal, while disorder and impurity reflect ugliness. Appropriate techniques and rituals should be developed to address specific imbalances and reclaim connection with Teotl. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Artistic Integrity and Business Alignment</strong> : Genuine artistic creations and business operations should be well-rooted, balanced, true, and pure, reflecting and disclosing Teotl or ultimate reality. Leo critiques businesses that are detached from Teotl, causing ecological and societal damage, and suggests striving to align business practices with Teotl to promote balance and purity in the cosmos. </li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic Value and Moral Uprightness</strong> : Art and creative endeavors are aesthetically valuable when they present and embody Teotl, contributing positively to cosmic balance and purity. This requires a "Teotlized" heart, implying that the individual must be morally upright and aligned with ultimate truth to produce such work. </li>
</ul>

<ul>

He considers the rational-materialistic focus damaging, leading to widespread suffering and instability. </li>
<li><strong>Upright Behavior and Knowledge of Truth</strong> : Leo asserts that those who are unaware of Teotl create destructive art and business practices. He underscores the necessity for creators and leaders to be morally upright to contribute positively to society and the environment. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Life, Suffering, and Transience</strong> : Drawing parallels with Buddhist teachings on suffering and impermanence, Leo emphasizes the importance of connecting to Teotl to minimize personal and societal suffering. This connection can transform one's life into a beautiful and noble existence, akin to "flowering and singing." </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Life Blueprint and Self-Connection</strong> : Leo reiterates the importance of connecting with one's true nature, Teotl, to lead a fulfilling life. He describes this as the "master blueprint" for an amazing life and warns against the futility of seeking satisfaction in transient worldly pursuits. </li>
<li><strong>Religion and Its Essence</strong> : Encouraging a deep understanding of religion, Leo asks materialists and atheists to contemplate the significance of religion and find the kernel of truth it holds. He advocates an integral approach to spiritual texts, gleaning from them the high-level concepts and techniques to apply to one's life, transcending dogmatic and orthodox views. </li>
<li><strong>Integrative Approach to Wisdom</strong> : Leo advises studying a variety of spiritual and philosophical texts to triangulate on wisdom and truth. He emphasizes the value of ancient scriptures while cautioning against becoming overly attached to any single tradition to avoid spiritual traps and broaden one's understanding of truth. </li>
<li><strong>Undervaluing Religion's Wisdom</strong> : Leo criticizes the materialist view that dismisses religion as outdated superstition. He highlights the importance of recognizing the valuable role religion has played in human societies across history and seeks to uncover the deeper truths contained within spiritual traditions.</li>
