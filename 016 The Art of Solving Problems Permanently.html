            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FFrR0cGWnac' target='_blank'>The Art of Solving Problems Permanently</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Tendency to Seek Quick Fixes</b>: Leo observes a universal inclination to seek quick fixes that only address symptoms, rather than tackling the underlying causes of problems.
</li><li><b>Complex Nature of Problems</b>: He articulates the interconnectedness and complexity of issues, noting that what initially presents as one sort of problem often unravels to reveal deeper root causes.
</li><li><b>Surface–Level Solutions vs. Root Causes</b>: Leo gives an example of weight loss, underscoring how superficial solutions like calorie counting fail if deeper issues, such as dissatisfaction at work leading to emotional eating, are not addressed.
</li><li><b>Challenges in Coaching Depth</b>: In his coaching, Leo encounters the dilemma of how deeply to go in addressing a client's problem, noting that most superficial issues have underlying personal causes that require significant work to unravel.
</li><li><b>Fear of Digging Deeper into Problems</b>: The hesitation to confront and untangle deep–seated problems stems from fear and the potential realization that solving these issues is more labor–intensive than expected.
</li><li><b>The Ball of Yarn Analogy</b>: Leo uses the analogy of a yarn ball to describe problem–solving, where superficial fixes are like snipping off loose ends instead of untangling the entire ball to address the true cause.
</li><li><b>Sustainability of Effort and Solutions</b>: He expresses that solutions which only address superficial aspects lead to unsustainable outcomes, whereas unraveling deeper issues can lead to permanent change.
</li><li><b>Cascading Effect of Unraveling Problems</b>: A cascade of root causes is often revealed when one begins to address apparent problems, such as a health issue being traced back to job dissatisfaction, then to a lack of necessary skills, and finally to a potential need for further education.
</li><li><b>Self–Responsibility for Life Circumstances</b>: Leo insists that individuals must recognize that their circumstances are ultimately tied to themselves, and they must identify and change aspects of themselves to permanently overcome their problems.
</li><li><b>Fear and Resistance to Addressing Core Issues</b>: There is a common resistance to addressing the core of problems due to fear and the involved complexity, yet acknowledging and working on these issues is vital for lasting solutions.
</li><li><b>Limiting Beliefs Impeding Progress</b>: Leo explains that a lack of education and skills might be linked to deeper limiting beliefs about one's inherent intelligence or ability to succeed in school, which prevents a cascade of positive changes in life.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Unraveling the Problem</b>: Unraveling underlying issues often leads to improvements in multiple life areas. Addressing one problem creates a domino effect, setting other facets into place and resulting in a life that functions well across the board.
</li><li><b>Amortization of Effort Over Time</b>: While gaining an education or skill set can be challenging and time–consuming, Leo notes that the effort invested amortizes over time, offering long–term benefits without constant upkeep.
</li><li><b>Higher Earning Potential</b>: Achieving a higher salary grade from improved education and job opportunities can raise one's standard of living for decades, allowing for investments in health, better living environments, and overall happiness.
</li><li><b>The Complexity of Permanent Solutions</b>: Leo acknowledges the daunting complexity of seeking permanent solutions compared to attractive quick fixes like fad diets, emphasizing the greater effort involved in long–term problem solving.
</li><li><b>Importance of Inner Beliefs and Systems</b>: Drawing an analogy with tree roots, Leo stresses that inner beliefs, habits, and attitudes form an unseen yet essential support system for sustainable personal growth.
</li><li><b>Urging to Seek Permanent Over Temporary Fixes</b>: He argues that the hard work necessary for lasting change results in a sustainably happy life, encouraging a holistic life overhaul instead of opting for superficial, temporary fixes.
