            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/q1LetVyCMb0' target='_blank'>Learning = Observation</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Learning as a Multifaceted Process</b>: Leo explains learning from multiple perspectives, emphasizing the profound impact of observation as a key aspect of learning. It is through observation that the deepest learning can occur.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Observation</b>: Leo contends that observation is often misunderstood and mistaken for other activities such as thinking, reading, listening to lectures, or daydreaming. True observation involves looking at something for an extended period without an agenda.
</li><li><b>Observation's Rare Practice</b>: He points out the rarity of true observation in modern culture. He challenges the viewer to recall the last time they observed an object for an extended period without distraction or intention, hinting at how infrequent such practice is.
</li><li><b>The Profundity of Observation</b>: Leo argues that despite its simplicity, observation can be overlooked for its depth and potential impact. He suggests that to truly understand its value, one must engage in prolonged, agenda–free observation.
</li><li><b>Example of Masterful Observation – Leonardo da Vinci</b>: Leo references Leonardo da Vinci as the epitome of a master observer whose breadth and depth of achievements were rooted in his meticulous observation skills.
</li><li><b>Observation's Innate Power</b>: Leo describes observation as possessing an almost supernatural capacity to facilitate spontaneous learning and creativity, which he sees as foundational to all human intelligence.
</li><li><b>Observation as a Path to Unmediated Reality</b>: Through sustained observation, Leo believes one gains unmediated access to reality, a privilege rarely experienced due to our habitual projections of biases and language onto our perceptions.
</li><li><b>Transcending Personal Bias</b>: Observation is presented as a means to transcend the self–centric perceptions that color our everyday life, allowing us to see things as they are, beyond personal goals and fears.
</li><li><b>Observation as the Essence of Science</b>: Leo attributes the success of science to empiricism, which is based on precise observation that transcends language and the "monkey mind." He encourages scientists to delve deeper into pure observation for greater discovery.
</li><li><b>Cultural Rarity of Observation</b>: The cultural and social environment we live in, according to Leo, emphasizes immediate payoff and manipulation instead of the patient and unbiased observation which he views as counterintuitive to society's norms.
</li><li><b>Building Observation Skills</b>: Finally, Leo emphasizes the importance of developing strong observation skills, which comes not from immediate returns but through patience and the willingness to see beyond the ego and cultural constructs.
</li><li><b>Cultural and societal bias towards action over observation</b>: Leo points out that society and culture prioritize knowledge, thinking, and tangible action, undervaluing the practice of simple, unbiased observation.
</li><li><b>Education system's neglect of the skill of observation</b>: He highlights that schools don't teach how to observe but focus instead on memorization, tests, and projects, which emphasizes active doing over passive observing.
</li><li><b>Developing observation skill</b>: Leo suggests practicing observation by looking closely at an object without preconceived notions, agendas, or manipulation, staying still and alert, and integrating this into everyday life.
</li><li><b>Observation in daily life</b>: He recommends becoming proficient at observation so that it becomes a natural part of daily experience, rather than a structured, time–consuming habit.
</li><li><b>Differentiating observation from meditation</b>: Leo clarifies that while meditation can foster observation skills, it's crucial to not let meditation techniques inhibit pure observation with their inherent goals and spiritual aims.
</li><li><b>Observation enhancing meditation and vice versa</b>: He encourages experimenting with observation as part of meditation to enrich and deepen the practice, while cautioning against dilution of focus from dabbling in too many techniques.
</li><li><b>Observational awareness as a problem solver</b>: Leo believes that applying observation to life issues can lead to their automatic resolution due to the power of heightened awareness.
</li><li><b>Diverse objects of observation for self–awareness</b>: He advises observing a range of subjects, including one's internal processes, emotions, physical objects, nature, and importantly, other people and society without judgment to develop self–awareness.
</li><li><b>Observation vs. Behavior Change</b>: Leo discusses the synergy between learning through observation and learning through behavior change, stating they offer different but compatible approaches to development.
</li><li><b>Observation as a mark of exceptional individuals</b>: He asserts that observation is a key trait of influential figures throughout history, like sages and geniuses, and is essential for becoming an extraordinary person.
</li><li><b>Nothingness as the ultimate test of observation</b>: Leo challenges listeners to observe the most subtle concept of nothingness, citing Leonardo da Vinci's profound ability to see and understand such abstract ideas.
