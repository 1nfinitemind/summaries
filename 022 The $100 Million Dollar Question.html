            <ul>
    <li><b>Visualizing $100 Million</b>: Leo encourages viewers to vividly imagine waking up with $100 million in their bank account and to consider what they would do once all their material desires were satisfied, pushing them to think about their true long–term passions and purpose in life.
</li><li><b>Self–reflection after fulfillment of material desires</b>: Leo reflects that after acquiring luxury items and satisfying immediate material desires, one must contemplate what they would genuinely spend their life doing, whether it's creative work, supporting a cause, or pursuing personal interests.
</li><li><b>Aligning actions with deep satisfaction</b>: Leo shares his personal realization that, even with hypothetical limitless funds, he would continue to engage in making informative videos on self–development, indicating that true fulfillment aligns with one's deepest interests and sources of satisfaction.
</li><li><b>The challenge of actualizing one's purpose</b>: Leo notes the difficulty in pursuing one's true calling, especially without the financial freedom of $100 million, acknowledging the real–world barriers like bills, societal expectations, and lack of resources that can prevent individuals from following their passions.
</li><li><b>Authentic self–expression and impact</b>: Leo discusses the significance of expressing oneself authentically, asserting that those who can fully infuse their deepest values and personality into their work cultivate a unique form of genius and create significant impact, drawing others to their authentic offerings.
</li><li><b>The reality of practical challenges</b>: He acknowledges the practical challenges faced even when one understands their true self, such as societal pressures and financial constraints, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between personal fulfillment and economic sustainability.
</li><li><b>Courage and strategy for authentic living</b>: Leo advises using courage, intellect, and practical tools to position oneself for authentic self–expression, focusing on personal fulfillment and potential financial rewards without being excessively concerned with the opinions of others.
</li><li><b>Long–term journey towards self–expression</b>: Recognizing that the pursuit of authenticity is a complex and long–term endeavor, Leo suggests that it may take years or even decades to fully understand oneself and find ways to express one's true nature, possibly through creating a business or other means for financial independence.
</li><li><b>The power of aligned authenticity</b>: He conveys that being in harmony with one's true self and authentic expression is immensely fulfilling and can lead to extraordinary achievements and financial success, as genuine offerings naturally attract recognition and support. 
</li><li><b>Creating an action plan for true self–expression</b>: Finally, Leo urges viewers to identify their unique self–expression and develop actionable steps toward actualizing it, with the ultimate goal of living a life that fully represents one's true self and values.
