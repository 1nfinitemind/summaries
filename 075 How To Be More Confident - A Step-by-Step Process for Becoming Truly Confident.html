    <li><b>Leo's personal struggle with confidence</b>: He shares his journey from feeling unattractive and insecure due to being overweight, leading to an assertiveness that he wasn't satisfied with both in intimate relationships and social situations.
</li><li><b>Impact of limiting beliefs on confidence</b>: Confidence issues often stem from limiting beliefs instilled during childhood or early adulthood, whether self–imposed or environmentally influenced, leading to concerns about rejection, embarrassment, or disapproval.
</li><li><b>Natural extraversion obscured by past trauma</b>: Leo introduces the idea from another author that introversion results from trauma obscuring natural extraversion, highlighting personal incidents where treatment by family, friends, or others may have caused retreat and suppression of extroversion.
</li><li><b>Identification of specific confidence challenges</b>: The methodical approach begins with detailing exactly where and in what type of situations confidence is lacking, such as dating, work, or general social interactions, in order to effectively address and overcome these.
</li><li><b>Alternative actions for confidence development</b>: As a practical exercise, Leo urges creating a 'Confidence Game Plan' that entails imagining how a confident person would act and think in those identified situations, and considering adopting these traits.
</li><li><b>Gradual confidence–building through behavior change</b>: The strategy involves incremental steps out of one's comfort zone, avoiding overwhelming fear, and recognizing that confidence grows with repeated practice in daily interactions.
</li><li><b>Daily affirmations to reshape self–image</b>: Two affirmations, "I love being confident" and "I am independent of the good or bad opinion of others," are recommended to be repeated daily for five minutes each over two months to work on subconscious self–esteem issues related to needing approval.
</li><li><b>Benefit of visualization in confidence building</b>: Leo recommends spending five minutes each morning visualizing oneself acting confidently in challenging situations, with continued practice for two months to prep the mind for real–world application.
</li><li><b>Transference to real–life confident actions</b>: The purpose of affirmations and visualizations is to prime for the real–world action of taking confident steps during actual events and pushing through initial discomfort to establish natural confidence.
</li><li><b>Socialization as a key to growing confidence</b>: A call to action for those lacking confidence is made to actively engage in social opportunities, from accepting party invitations to organizing work lunches, to break the habit of solitary avoidance.
</li><li><b>Building a long–term confidence–oriented lifestyle</b>: Leo concludes by emphasizing the need for a long–term commitment to developing oneself through progressive steps starting with affirmations and visualizations, leading to proactive real–life changes for an overall improved personal life.
