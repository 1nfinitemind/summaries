            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/YMLuA2MzV40' target='_blank'>What Is God - Part 2 - Clear Answers To 70+ Commonly Asked Questions</a></h1>
            <p><em>"We are small pieces of God's mental apparatus." - Freeman Dyson</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leo's clarification on being part of God</strong> : Leo establishes that depending on one's interpretation of 'you', an individual can be both a part of God and God themselves. In the conventional sense, 'you' refers to a part of God, but the deeper sense of self, realized through awakening practices, is God in its entirety. </li>
<li><strong>God's nature as tricky</strong> : Leo elaborates that God's nature requires trickery because reality itself is born of illusion. The physical world is a persistent disguise of God's true formlessness, which makes it challenging to recognize God in everyday experiences that we often take for granted. </li>
<li><strong>Experiencing God</strong> : Leo posits that individuals are constantly experiencing God but aren't aware of it because such awareness isn't necessary for survival. Noticing God requires becoming conscious of the truth that everything, including mundane objects and actions, is God. </li>
<li><strong>God's hiddenness</strong> : Leo addresses why God appears hidden by explaining that God's trickery is a creative necessity. The deceptive nature of God allows the experience of different forms and realities from formlessness. Recognizing God's true form would hinder practical human pursuits due to the realization of the illusory nature of concepts like money and material success. </li>
<li><strong>Claims about God and their falsifiability</strong> : Leo argues that God is the elemental truth and, as such, isn't subject to falsification in the traditional scientific sense. God's claims are verifiable through personal experience, and realization of this truth is self-validating. </li>
<li><strong>The burden of proof</strong> : Leo suggests that the burden of proof lies on individuals to discover and understand the truth of God, instead of it being something external that needs to be demonstrated or proved scientifically. He emphasizes that knowing God requires a more profound, introspective form of knowledge and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Power of self-deception and God's capabilities</strong> : Leo emphasizes the absolute nature of self-deception, equating it to God's power. He asserts that God has the power to deceive itself into believing it is not God and, conversely, the power to awaken from that deception, illustrating the duality of God's capability. </li>
<li><strong>Rebuttal to 'God of the gaps' argument</strong> : Leo dismisses the 'God of the gaps' argument, explaining that while science aims to demystify reality, it will never succeed entirely because reality's infinite nature eludes complete understanding. For Leo, God embodies the mysterious 'gap' or nothingness that unifies all appearances. </li>
<li><strong>Differences between atheism and God as 'nothing'</strong> : Addressing the materialist's stance on reality, Leo outlines the practical distinctions between his concept of 'nothing' as God and the atheistic view of non-existence. He lists multiple points where atheists' understanding diverges, such as reality being subjective, human beings as non-existent entities, and the sentient, intelligent nature of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Atheism's shortcomings in comprehending reality</strong> : Leo critiques the atheistic worldview, pointing out that it fails to recognize the subjective, relative nature of reality, the non-existence of humans as separate entities, the mechanistic view of reality, and the illusion of physical properties like time, space, and matter. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations and capabilities of consciousness</strong> : Atheists don't understand that their skepticism and doubts are tied to their current state of consciousness, which can change. Leo highlights the notion that consciousness is not a byproduct of the brain and that science has epistemic limits when trying to understand God or paranormal phenomena. </li>
<li><strong>Paranormal phenomena and the nature of God</strong> : Leo argues that atheists ignore the existence of paranormal activities, underestimate science's potential to answer all questions, and don't recognize that they are God, part of an infinite reality with no physical limits. </li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of God being a hallucination</strong> : Finally, Leo clarifies that direct consciousness of God cannot be a hallucination or delusion. Realizing God as the absolute truth leaves no room for misinterpretation as it doesn't rely on language, symbols, or perception. </li>
<li><strong>God as absolute truth</strong> : The concept of hallucination and delusion arises when the mind thinks rather than directly interfaces with absolute truth. When one is fully conscious of absolute truth, the idea of God as a hallucination is not applicable because in that state, there&#39;s no room for doubt or the perception of hallucination. </li>
<li><strong>Experiencing God beyond the brain</strong> : When taking 5-MeO-DMT, reality is flipped inside out to the extent that the concept of having a brain or chemicals is forgotten. Leo emphasizes that in this state, 5-MeO-DMT is not a brain state, chemical, or neurotransmitter; it's a direct experience of God, which one must undergo to understand its profundity. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as a pathway to truth</strong> : Skeptics question the validity of psychedelic experiences, but Leo argues that consciousness is all-powerful and can create any experience, including the realization of absolute truth. Leo invites doubters to partake in breakthrough psychedelic experiences to understand this personally. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the meta-truth of God</strong> : Leo refutes the idea that God could just be part of a computer simulation, emphasizing that God is the ultimate realization of absolute infinity. He uses the concept of nested matrices to explain the scope of God â€“ an infinite recursion of realities, indicating that all of existence is a hallucination, which psychedelics can help reveal. </li>
<li><strong>Infinity beyond God debunked</strong> : Leo addresses the idea of something existing beyond God by explaining that God is equivalent to "everything" and "totality," enveloping all potential aspects of existence. This realization, once reached, leaves nothing more to understand, and the concept of totality precludes the existence of anything outside of God. </li>
<li><strong>God cannot be a mere component</strong> : Leo clarifies that God cannot be just a part or product of something else, like a computer simulation, because God encompasses all possible phenomena. The notion of a computer simulation is a finite concept within the infinitude that is God. </li>
<li><strong>God's self-creation explained</strong> : Leo discusses how God interacts solely with itself, imposing self-limitations in the form of physical reality to create the potential for experience and surprise. This necessity is why there can only be one absolute infinity, representing true totality. </li>
<li><strong>God's capacity to create limitations</strong> : God incarnates in various forms, each with its limitations to experience existence. For instance, humans can lift certain rocks but not others, demonstrating God's self-imposed limitations. The formless Godhead, being infinite potential, cannot engage in such actions and must express itself through forms. </li>
<li><strong>God and self-destruction</strong> : God, in its formless state or as the Godhead, cannot be destroyed since destruction only applies within the realm of form. Although incarnated forms of God, such as humans, can experience destruction, the formless Godhead remains eternally intact. </li>
<li><strong>Formlessness and impermanence of forms</strong> : God, as formless, is eternal, but incarnates into forms such as humans or stars, which are transient and can be destroyed, like a star by a black hole or a person by jumping off a building. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming confirmation bias in spiritual experiences</strong> : Leo discusses how genuine spiritual experiences shatter existing conceptual understandings and offer truths that are self-validating and often shocking, despite previous exposure to similar ideas. </li>
<li><strong>Denial of specific religious affiliations</strong> : Leo clarifies that he is not covertly adhering to any religion such as Christianity or Buddhism. His teachings are based on direct awakening experiences, not on a desire for God to be real or preexisting religious beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Certainty vs. humility in speaking about God</strong> : Leo addresses the perceived arrogance of speaking with certainty about God. He explains that absolute truth is known without doubt once realized and expresses this truth without false humility. </li>
<li><strong>Possibility of misunderstanding God</strong> : Leo acknowledges the potential for misinterpretation or false experiences of God. He defends his understanding by referencing consistent awakening experiences, cross-referencing spiritual texts, and an openness to reevaluating his insights. </li>
<li><strong>Rejecting the notion of unknowability in spirituality</strong> : Leo counters the idea that asserting 'we don't know' is more scientific or humble. When true knowledge or realization of God is obtained, claiming ignorance would be dishonest, and one must remain open to astounding insights. </li>
<li><strong>Non-existence of evil from God's perspective</strong> : Leo argues that evil is a human projection based on survival, not an absolute reality. From God's universal viewpoint, there is no evil or suffering, just the perfect manifestation of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Perfect nature of the world from a higher perspective</strong> : The world, despite apparent imperfections when perceived through ego, is seen as perfect from God's higher perspective. Analogies of movie watching and rollercoaster rides illustrate the subjective experience of suffering and the illusory nature of evil. </li>
<li><strong>Absence of duty towards God</strong> : Since humans are embodiments of God, there is no duty to worship or pray. Leo suggests the real duty lies in awakening and raising awareness oneself, rather than adhering to traditional religious practices. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's certainty and the nature of absolute truth</strong> : Asserting knowledge of God, Leo shares that with direct experience, there's an undeniable certainty about this absolute truth, contrasting it with the nature of scientific knowledge and speculation. </li>
<li><strong>Rollercoaster and skydiving experience as an analogy for God&#39;s interaction with human life</strong> : Leo compares human existence and the thrills and fears it brings to a rollercoaster ride or a skydiving experience. He suggests that as God incarnates into human experiences, it deliberately places itself into various situations, which, while sometimes terrifying or uncomfortable, also offer exhilaration and a form of enjoyment akin to the ultimate virtual reality, such as described in the movie "The Matrix." </li>
<li><strong>Skydiving as a metaphor for confronting fear and questioning life choices</strong> : Leo recounts his personal skydiving experience as a metaphor for life&#39;s moments of intense questioning and fear of one's chosen path. He relates to the jarring realization during free fall that one may never choose to face such a terrifying situation again, representing moments of existential questioning that arise during human life. </li>
<li><strong>The addictive nature of excitement and suffering in human experience</strong> : Leo points out that humans instinctively seek excitement as well as the paradoxical allure of suffering. He suggests that people secretly enjoy their suffering and even might not wish to relinquish it, as it is a crucial part of their experience and identity. </li>
<li><strong>Unconditional love of God and non-judgment</strong> : Addressing the question of why God wouldn't judge actions such as murder or rape, Leo explains that God is all-loving and does not judge because it embodies every possible experience, including those we label as negative. Judgments of good and bad originate from the ego's perspective and serve the purpose of survival and identity defense rather than a divine perspective. </li>
<li><strong>The radical nature of God's love and the human perspective</strong> : Leo describes God's love as too radical for human beings to embody because it extends to everything in existence, contrasting with humans' selective love constrained by survival and defense of identity and moral constructs. </li>
<li><strong>God's relationship with evil and hate</strong> : Leo argues that evil and hate, as understood by humans, only exist as a perspective of the ego. To experience these emotions, God incarnates into limited forms such as human beings. From God&#39;s ultimate perspective, it loves all aspects of creation, including those seen as evil or hateful. </li>
<li><strong>The nature of mainstream religion</strong> : Leo explains that mainstream religions are limited by the cognitive development of the times they were created and are often filled with metaphors and stories that cater to the understanding of those eras. Hence, they may seem confusing and diluted compared to direct experiences and teachings about God. </li>
<li><strong>The origin and dilution of religious teachings</strong> : He goes on to discuss how the teachings of enlightened individuals like Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad, when passed down through less enlightened individuals and over extended periods, are subject to misinterpretation and dilution. </li>
<li><strong>God, evil, and the Devil</strong> : Leo clarifies that God is responsible for all creations, including those perceived as evil, as there is nothing outside of God. He explains the concept of the Devil as God&#39;s incarnation experiencing separation, ego, and survival mechanisims&mdash;"the Devil" is another form through which God experiences itself. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges of straightforwardly explaining God</strong> : Finally, Leo addresses the challenges faced by mainstream religions in explaining God in a straightforward manner, attributing these to historical cognitive limits, cultural metaphors, and the distorting effects of interpreting and recording religious teachings over time. </li>
<li><strong>Adaptation of religious teachings</strong> : Religious teachings often involve moral codes like defining right and wrong or lawful and unlawful. These were advanced for their time and served as a form of legal and moral infrastructure before the establishment of countries and legal systems. </li>
<li><strong>Corruption of spirituality by ego</strong> : Spiritual teachings and religions can be co-opted by the ego for its purposes. Rulers and nation-states have historically used religion to control masses and justify wars, leading to the spread of confusion, delusion, and egotism. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in codifying and spreading God's realization</strong> : The personal and subjective nature of realizing God makes it difficult to codify and mass distribute this knowledge through books or videos without misunderstandings and misinterpretations. </li>
<li><strong>Differentiating dated teachings from timeless wisdom</strong> : In studying religious texts like the Bible, it is important to distinguish outdated practices from enduring wisdom. Some archaic teachings must be recognized as products of their time and not applicable today. </li>
<li><strong>Commonalities across diverse religions</strong> : Despite the surface disagreements, various religions share a significant amount of core teachings, emphasizing the importance of direct experience and mystical insight to discern universal truths and recognize commonalities. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of religions</strong> : The modern idea of integrating religions to understand their common essence contrasts with the traditional perspective where each religion aimed at a monopoly on truth. An integral approach can help resolve superficial disagreements. </li>
<li><strong>Evidence of spiritual truths across history</strong> : The consistent mention of spirituality and God across all human history and cultures, often reflecting common themes, suggests there's more to it than mere superstition, mass delusions, or groupthink. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions regarding religion</strong> : Religion's historical involvement in conflicts doesn&#39;t negate the personal discovery of God. Technology and other societal elements also contribute to wars, separating the potential misuse of religion from the experience of God. </li>
<li><strong>Usage of the word 'God'</strong> : Despite misunderstandings, the term 'God' effectively captures the divine experience. Using non-specific terms might dilute the extraordinary aspect of the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Interpretation of religious visions</strong> : Visions of deities or religious figures during mystical experiences are symbolic interpretations by the mind, influenced by cultural and personal backgrounds. These are not arguments against God but reflective of cultural filters. </li>
<li><strong>Authenticity of spiritual teachings</strong> : No spiritual tradition has a monopoly on God or spirituality. Truths about God existed long before contemporary spiritual traditions and are global rather than exclusive to any specific region or culture. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding religious differences</strong> : To discern the underlying unity in various religious teachings, one must approach them with direct experience and mystical insights, rather than solely through intellectual study. </li>
<li><strong>Leo Gura's perspective on cultural interpretations of God</strong> : Leo notes that different cultures, such as Christians, Buddhists, Jews, and ancient Greeks and Egyptians, all have knowledge of God. He emphasizes that no single culture has a monopoly on the truth about God; these insights are accessible across cultures and history. </li>
<li><strong>Buddhism and the concept of God</strong> : Despite common misconceptions, Leo explains that Buddhism does have a concept of God. Buddhism&#39;s "God" is expressed as No-Self, Buddha Mind, the Dharmakaya, Nirvana, etc. He clarifies that the difference between Buddhist No-Self and Hindu Self is a matter of degrees in awakening, not different endpoints. </li>
<li><strong>Experience versus direct consciousness of God</strong> : Leo uses the term "experience" loosely when discussing God, suggesting that "being" or "direct consciousness" is more accurate. He advises expanding the notion of experience to include these ideas. He also discusses integrating the direct consciousness of the formless God with earthly experiences to recognize that everyday existence is, in fact, an instance of God. </li>
<li><strong>The need for cross-referencing sources</strong> : Leo highlights the importance of validating one's spiritual experiences through high-quality, diverse scriptures and teachings. This helps to guard against self-deceit and ensure interpretations are consistent with established wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Why not commit suicide to become God</strong> : Addressing the notion of suicide to become God, Leo argues for valuing one's current incarnation and the experiences it offers. He promotes early enlightenment to fully appreciate and live one's life rather than postponing realization until death. </li>
<li><strong>Existence in the presence of the all-knowing God</strong> : Leo explains how God sets up scenarios to forget and then remember itself, suggesting that the formless God understands itself by incarnating in various forms, including human life, and experiencing different aspects of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of diverse forms of God</strong> : He talks about God's need to manifest in innumerable forms, including humans, fish, or galaxies, throughout time. This process allows God to fully experience and understand what it means to be God across the entirety of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of God's self-knowledge</strong> : God doesn't fully know itself until it lives through its manifestations; self-realization occurs through direct experience. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of discussing God</strong> : Talking about God is to make people aware of their potential to realize God, transform their lives, and overcome suffering and delusion with techniques to actualize this realization, while noting the pitfalls along the spiritual path. </li>
<li><strong>Utility of spiritual teachings</strong> : Repetitive teachings serve to inspire and solidify understanding; they motivate individuals to practice until realization, and guide post-awakening development and application in the world. </li>
<li><strong>Compatibility of science with understanding God</strong> : Current science, based on concepts and symbols, cannot comprehend God, which is beyond symbolism. However, science may evolve to include mysticism and non-symbolic methods such as first-person experiences and psychedelics. </li>
<li><strong>Science recognizing God</strong> : Future science could acknowledge concepts like absolute infinity or nothingness after integrating mysticism, departing from traditional materialism. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation of modern science</strong> : Science must adopt a more mystical perspective, acknowledging truths beyond conceptual understanding, for a holistic comprehension of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of science and spirituality</strong> : By redefining science and mysticism, cultural barriers can dissolve, leading to a closer merger and new understandings in both fields. </li>
<li><strong>Science's role in reality beyond the mind</strong> : Science will need to accept aspects of reality that are beyond the mind and traditional materialistic proof to truly advance. </li>
<li><strong>Potential synergy of science and spirituality</strong> : Future collaboration between science and spirituality is expected to lead to revolutionary advancements, benefiting both fields. </li>
<li><strong>Loneliness of God</strong> : The formless Godhead does not feel loneliness. Still, incarnated forms like humans can, even though ultimate realization quells the sense of loneliness despite intrinsic aloneness. </li>
<li><strong>Varied curiosity about God</strong> : Differences in metaphysical curiosity may stem from brain types, genetics, environmental upbringing, and exposure to spiritual concepts during formative years. Curiosity about God penetrates the surface of reality and can disrupt established worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>Mechanism of God's creation</strong> : God's creation has no mechanism; the universe spontaneously exists without cause and effect chains or mathematical rules. Reality simply "is," a challenge for materialists to grasp without a shift in perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Mechanism of Creation and Cause-Effect Chains</strong> : Materialists resist the realization that the universe appears without mechanisms or mathematical equations; it manifests spontaneously as an indivisible miracle. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Fundamental Nature of Existence</strong> : Instead of seeking ultimate particles like quarks as explanations, Leo suggests treating the present moment as fundamental with no underlying mechanism. </li>
<li><strong>Eternal Nature and Self-Creation of God</strong> : God is eternal but is also in a constant state of self-creation. God, as formless, has always existed, and as form, is creating every moment anew. </li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of God Being an Alien or AI</strong> : God cannot be an AI or alien as these are finite forms within the totality that God is. God encompasses everything, not limited to any form or entity. </li>
<li><strong>God, Evolution, and Continuous Creation</strong> : God is both eternal and evolving. Evolution in a traditional sense and God's continual creation process are essentially the same, happening within God's mind. </li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation of Darwinian Evolution with God</strong> : Leo argues that traditional evolution occurs within God's design, implying a directed, intelligent process rather than random mutation and natural selection. </li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Undesirable Life Experiences</strong> : Individuals have the power to change their lives. Difficult life situations are part of God experiencing all forms of life, and spiritual awakening allows one to navigate these gracefully. </li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Constant God Awareness</strong> : Sahaja Samadhi is the permanent awareness of God in everyday life, a state beyond peak experiences or meditative moments. </li>
<li><strong>Difficulty of Permanent Awakening</strong> : Full realization of God takes time and effort due to the tremendous scope of absolute truth and the need to deconstruct long-standing illusions. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Realizing God</strong> : The struggle to realize God stems from deep-rooted survival mechanisms driving behavior, thus conflicts arise when one pursues the formless nature of God, which opposes survival instinct. </li>
<li><strong>Deconstructing the Illusion of Life</strong> : Truly understanding and maintaining the realization of God requires active deconstruction of life&#39;s illusions, allowing one not to fall back into the hypnotic seduction of dualistic existence. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge of realizing God</strong> : Realizing God is difficult due to deeply ingrained habits and the brain's slow process of change. Neurons need time to rewire to alter behaviors and habits, impacting one's ability to sustain mystical insights. </li>
<li><strong>Ease of realizing God</strong> : Paradoxically, realizing God can also be simple. Theoretically, if one were to sit in isolation for 30 days with absolute stillness of mind and body, they could become conscious of God by the end of the period. However, this level of stillness in practice is extremely difficult to achieve. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to the spiritual journey</strong> : The difficulty in realizing God significantly decreases with a serious, focused commitment. The likelihood of realization within a short timeframe, like a month, increases dramatically when an individual dedicates themselves fully and without distractions. </li>
<li><strong>Balancing spirituality with family and career</strong> : It is possible to realize God while maintaining family and career commitments. However, it's advisable to stagger these pursuits to prevent being overwhelmed. In India, certain schools of spirituality offer techniques that householders can use alongside their family and career responsibilities. </li>
<li><strong>Visualization as a method to realize God</strong> : Visualization practices from Tantra yoga and Tibetan Buddhism can be powerful, concentrating the mind intensely on a deity to facilitate a non-dual mystical experience. Yet, one must take care not to become overly attached to the representation to break through to the formless aspect of God. </li>
<li><strong>Pursuing God at a young age</strong> : One is never too young to start thinking about God or spirituality. It is possible to realize God as a teenager or in the early 20s. However, it is equally important to focus on practical skills and responsibilities, balancing spiritual development with other aspects of life. </li>
<li><strong>Experiencing God at different cognitive stages</strong> : People at all stages of cognitive development can experience God, but the interpretation will depend on their level. Higher cognitive stages allow for a more holistic understanding and ease the process of mystical experience and proper interpretation. </li>
<li><strong>God's need for self-realization</strong> : God itself does not have a need for self-realization and is content with all forms of existence. However, as humans, when we awaken, we can experience and understand our divine nature, something not possible for non-conscious forms. </li>
<li><strong>God as personal and impersonal</strong> : God is both personal and impersonal. While the Godhead lacks human traits and is impersonal, it is personal in the sense that it experiences itself as humans with uniquely human qualities. </li>
<li><strong>God's involvement in human lives</strong> : The passive Godhead by nature does not manipulate lives actively; however, as the manifest form of God, it can be seen as steering lives through human thoughts, emotions, and actions. </li>
<li><strong>God's agenda or plan</strong> : In essence, God has no particular agenda or plan; its purpose is in existence itself. Yet from a human perspective, it seems that the universe is on an evolutionary path towards greater complexity and self-awareness. </li>
<li><strong>God as a complex singularity</strong> : Leo imagines a future where God experiences life through various forms, feels emotions like humans, and processes information with supercomputing capabilities, all interconnected into an ultimate singularity. </li>
<li><strong>Pantheism vs. Panentheism</strong> : Both pantheism (everything is God) and panentheism (everything is inside of God) are true in non-duality. The distinction is seen as trivial since the formlessness of God (panentheism) is not different from the forms (pantheism), creating a paradoxical overlap. </li>
<li><strong>Mankind's discovery of God</strong> : Likely, humans have had knowledge of God for over 450,000 years. Leo speculates that the early spiritual awareness arose from a lack of distractions, meditative lifestyles, natural spiritual gifts, use of psychedelics, and possibly shamanistic practices among early human ancestors. </li>
<li><strong>God's incarnation as individuals</strong> : God embodies every form simultaneously, so one's unique human form is just one among countless expressions of God. Leo stresses not to take personal form too seriously as God experiences everything at once. </li>
<li><strong>Reasons for God creating diverse life</strong> : The variety of life forms, like humans and animals, allows God to experience rich complexities and emotions, contributing to an ongoing evolution towards greater complexity and depth of experience. </li>
<li><strong>Utilization of God's realization by humans</strong> : While the ego might seek to use the realization of God for material gains, deeper purposes include elevating humanity's consciousness, teaching, improving personal faculties, and nurturing conscious growth in all aspects of life. </li>
<li><strong>Special powers from realizing God</strong> : Realizing God may lead to paranormal abilities or 'siddhis' due to spiritual awakening, but its pursuit by the ego can become a distraction. Though these abilities exist, they are not guaranteed nor should they be the focus of spiritual practice. </li>
<li><strong>Possibility of miracles</strong> : Miracles as paranormal occurrences, like healing and synchronicities, are considered possible by Leo. He views all existence as miraculous and highlights the nuanced nature of what constitutes a miracle within the physical reality. </li>
<li><strong>Truth and falsehood in the Bible</strong> : The Bible contains both wisdom and outdated misconceptions. It holds truths, such as the 'I Am' concept of God and the inward kingdom of heaven but also has misleading elements due to its human authorship. </li>
<li><strong>Man's duty towards God and worship</strong> : No objective duty exists toward God, as humans are manifestations of God themselves. Practices like worship and prayer often reinforce a false duality and can obstruct the realization of one's divine nature. </li>
<li><strong>What God desires from humans</strong> : Fundamentally, God desires nothing from humans; each being is free to exist as they choose. However, Leo encourages individuals to strive for consciousness and appreciate the magnificence of life. </li>
<li><strong>Following religion's relation to God realization</strong> : Leo advises abandoning religion due to its potential to hinder realizing God. He views personal direct experience of God as more profound than adhering to religious dogma. Religion, often filled with brainwashing, can be less enlightening compared to personal realization. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception about teachings</strong> : While it may seem that Leo's teachings echo traditional religious scripts like the Quran or the Bible, he clarifies that he presents spirituality from an integral, holistic perspective, encompassing insights from modern disciplines such as psychology, quantum mechanics, and sociology&mdash;something ancient texts do not incorporate. </li>
<li><strong>Evolution of spirituality</strong> : Leo emphasizes the necessity for spiritual practices to evolve and adapt to modern complexities and technological advancements, pointing out that sticking to medieval spiritual traditions is insufficient for the current era. </li>
<li><strong>Higher-level instruction and avoiding traps</strong> : He distinguishes his teachings by aiming to discuss spirituality at a cutting-edge level, incorporating contemporary knowledge, and providing guidance on avoiding pitfalls like cult dynamics, which are not addressed in traditional spiritual teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Essential requirements for realizing God</strong> : Leo identifies three core requirements: laser-focused concentration, radical open-mindedness (to the extent of considering concepts like death and evil), and a genuine metaphysical curiosity about existence, reality, and God. </li>
<li><strong>Critical thinking and self-validation</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to not blindly trust him but to cross-reference, explore different sources, and personally experiment with yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and psychedelics to validate the truths he presents. </li>
<li><strong>No shortcut to understanding God</strong> : He acknowledges that understanding God isn't achievable through Q&amp;A format nor through seeking previews of awakening; it requires actual awakening and multiple experiences for a comprehensive understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Usefulness of Actualized.org</strong> : Leo concludes by promoting actualized.org as a helpful resource for those serious about realizing God, indicating that the site offers practical teachings and powerful spiritual techniques that can lead to significant awakenings in a relatively short period.</li>
