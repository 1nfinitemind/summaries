            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/EYWOX3OYfFQ' target='_blank'>All Criticism Is Untenable</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Untenability of Criticism from Non–Duality Perspective</b>: Leo Gura discusses how non–duality leads to the realization that criticism is fundamentally untenable because it operates on the illusion of separateness. In non–dual consciousness, everything is interconnected, and criticism is ultimately a form of self–critique, creating dissatisfaction and a lack of gratitude for life.
</li><li><b>Mental Trickery in Criticism</b>: Criticism is a tactic the mind uses to avoid responsibility and self–reflection by projecting internal problems onto others. To criticize effectively, one must believe in separation from the object of criticism, which denies the unity of all things and prevents one from recognizing the oneness of existence.
</li><li><b>Judgment as Rejection of Reality</b>: Criticism is intimately linked with judgment, which is a denial of reality as it is, assuming things could be otherwise. Leo notes that everything, governed by physical laws since the Big Bang, could not have unfolded differently than it has, making criticism a rejection of the truth of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Criticism as an Addiction in Western Culture</b>: Leo points out the societal addiction to criticism seen in news, politics, and social media. This behavior stems from an unwillingness to take responsibility and to self–reflect, reinforcing a cycle of criticism rather than contributing to solutions.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Donald Trump</b>: Leo uses Trump as an example of criticism stemming from an unconscious place versus a conscious understanding. He acknowledges his past criticisms of Trump but emphasizes that Trump is a product of certain conditions and cannot be otherwise, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding rather than surface–level criticism.
</li><li><b>Difficulty of Conscious Change for the Unconscious</b>: Addressing the criticism of Trump's behavior, Leo argues that for Trump to behave differently, a shift in consciousness would be required, which is difficult for highly unconscious individuals.
</li><li><b>Self–Reflection Essential to Understanding Criticism</b>: Leo calls for self–reflection as the pathway to understanding the untenability of criticism. He suggests that ingrained habits of judgment, moralization, and criticism need to be examined to rise above the ego's game.
</li><li><b>Trump as a Cultural Product</b>: Describing Trump as the exaggerated outcome of American materialistic culture, Leo urges a deeper look at the roots of societal issues like corporate greed, recognizing individual participation in these systemic problems.
</li><li><b>Criticism and the Mechanism of the Ego</b>: The ego divides reality, creating 'other' to criticize; but upon deeper analysis, it becomes evident that circumstances shape all behaviors, including those we criticize. Leo stresses the importance of recognizing one's role in perpetuating these behaviors.
</li><li><b>Importance of Growth and Higher Consciousness in Addressing Criticism</b>: Leo shares his own transformation, moving from a critical stance to a more conscious approach, where criticism is understood as self–defeating and unnecessary for one's evolution in consciousness.
</li><li><b>Role of Individuals in Corporations and Investment</b>: Leo Gura highlights how individuals working for web development companies or investing in the stock market contribute to funding corporations perceived as greedy. These corporations strive to give investors better returns, which results in the interconnected nature of societal roles and the cycle of wealth accumulation and inequality.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness and Hypocrisy in Criticism</b>: By criticizing certain elements of society, individuals actually expose their hypocrisy due to the interconnected nature of reality. Gura points out that criticizing anything is ultimately criticizing oneself because everything is part of the same system of reality–described as a strange loop or a self–involved circle–jerk.
</li><li><b>Misguided Criticism of Terrorism</b>: Leo critiques the shallow understanding of terrorism as a problem of radical Islam, emphasizing the role of Western policies and the manipulation of world affairs by powerful countries. He argues that terrorism is a consequence of actions by first–world countries aiming to create favorable business environments for corporations, exploiting resources, and widening the inequality gap with third–world countries.
</li><li><b>Western Responsibility in Geopolitical Issues</b>: Gura talks about the first–world countries' complicity in fostering terrorism by creating deep global inequalities through political and economic manipulations. This creates enemies and fuels resentment, which can lead to terrorism, showing the untenability of criticism that doesn't acknowledge our own contributing actions.
</li><li><b>Materialistic Paradigm and Culture Re–evaluation</b>: Leo calls for self–reflection and a re–evaluation of the materialistic culture in developed countries. He underlines the need to show compassion for other cultures and ways of life instead of exploiting them, highlighting the Western dogma of imposing its culture on others under the guise of scientific progress.
</li><li><b>Hypocrisy in Government Criticism</b>: Criticizing political and government issues often overlooks one's personal role in such matters. Leo points out that criticism contributes to the problem it critiques since it perpetuates unproductive behavior and distracts from taking actionable and constructive steps.
</li><li><b>Constructive Criticism of Science</b>: Gura explains that his criticism of science stems from love and a desire to see it evolve beyond its dogmatic and myopic tendencies. He understands the deep structures of science and its historical paradigms, advocating for a non–dogmatic approach that includes spirituality and other excluded phenomena.
</li><li><b>Non–duality Debates as Distraction</b>: Leo highlights the counterproductivity of debates over non–duality, stating that arguing about these teachings distracts from genuine spiritual work. True non–duality involves understanding that criticism of belief systems is ultimately pointless, and acceptance of reality as it is forms the basis of higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Criticism's Lack of Productivity in Improvement</b>: Leo challenges the belief that criticism necessarily leads to improvement, advocating for self–reflection as a more effective tool for progress. He implies that criticism is often a self–justifying, self–righteous action that doesn't change the present or constructively influence the future.
</li><li><b>Freedom to Respond to Wrongdoing</b>: Despite his argument against criticism's productivity, Gura acknowledges that individuals are free to act against wrongdoing such as resisting Nazis or opposing oppressors, but he questions the self–righteous nature of criticism and suggests a focus on responsible, reflective action instead of criticism.
</li><li><b>Sam Harris's criticism of Islam</b>: Leo Gura points out that while Sam Harris intends his criticism of Islam to prompt improvement, it may actually elicit the opposite effect, increasing hostility and resulting in personal threats to Harris, indicating criticism's potential to exacerbate rather than resolve issues.
</li><li><b>Criticism vs. Self–reflection for improvement</b>: Leo suggests that true improvement in the world comes not from criticism but from individuals taking radical ownership of their lives, engaging in deep self–reflection, and encouraging the same in others.
</li><li><b>The paradox of criticizing criticism</b>: As Leo criticizes Sam Harris, he acknowledges the paradox and untenability of criticism, highlighting that his critique serves to point out the potential to rise above the "mudslinging contest" of criticism.
</li><li><b>Non–dual nature of criticism</b>: Gura explains the non–dual reality wherein both all criticism is untenable due to its inherent contradictions and tenable given reality's infinite freedom, suggesting a meta perspective on the nature of criticism.
</li><li><b>Person A vs. Person B approaches to criticism</b>: Outlining the differences between two personas, Person A–who is heavily invested emotionally in criticism and experiences negative consequences–and Person B–who uses criticism pragmatically and remains unphased by the subjects of critique.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Past Criticism</b>: Leo acknowledges his previous critical nature towards various ideas and people. He admits that while he may still engage in some level of criticism, he's become aware that this approach is not conducive to reaching higher levels of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Personal Growth and Attitude Shift</b>: Leo has observed that maintaining a critical attitude imposes a 'glass ceiling' on his personal development. To transcend this limitation, he's committed to minimizing criticism to achieve higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Metaphor of Hyenas vs. Manta Ray</b>: Using the metaphor of hyenas fighting over a carcass versus a peaceful manta ray, Leo illustrates the difference between a life of constant criticism and one of tranquility and non–engagement with criticism.
</li><li><b>How to Become a Manta Ray</b>: To transition from a critical 'hyena' to a serene 'manta ray', Leo proposes six reflective questions to ask oneself before engaging in criticism, aiming to reframe one's perspective and actions.
</li><li><b>30–Day No Criticism Challenge</b>: He introduces a tangible practice, a 30–day challenge, to help participants avoid criticism. Wearing a wristband as a reminder, the challenge is to consciously refrain from criticizing, encouraging self–reflection and awareness.
</li><li><b>Final Words of Caution</b>: Leo warns against the trap of hypocritically using his anti–criticism stance to criticize others. He stresses that these insights should be inwardly focused to combat one's own ego, not wielded as a tool against others.
</li><li><b>Future Content Direction</b>: He closes by affirming that while recent topics have been existential, he plans to delve back into more practical subjects. Leo explains that his existential exploration will enhance the depth and significance of his future practical advice.
