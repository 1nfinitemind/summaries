            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ywHfNSwcCS8' target='_blank'>Becoming God - Insights From 13 Back-to-Back Awakenings</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Summarizing Leo's Awakenings</b>: Leo recaps his intense 30–day solo meditation retreat, detailing 13 sequential awakenings, each deeper than the last. Despite initial boredom and lack of results, the retreat proved to be the most productive period for his personal growth, culminating in profound insights and a major identity shift.
</li><li><b>Progression of Consciousness</b>: He elaborates on the use of 5–MeO–DMT over the final 15 days of the retreat, which led to extraordinary trips, vastly surpassing previous levels of consciousness and awakening. His experiences led him to believe that he reached states of awareness rarely achieved by human beings.
</li><li><b>Realization of Being God</b>: A critical revelation for Leo was recognizing that he is God, in a profound and complete sense. This enlightenment went beyond intellectual understanding to a cellular and experiential level, involving the realization of eternal creation and the structure of God as an infinitely intelligent, powerful, and loving existence.
</li><li><b>Depth and Complexity of Awakening</b>: Leo emphasizes the complexity and depth of awakening, asserting that any framework simplifying it into stages fails to capture the totality. Each awakening felt complete, yet the next one would seem even more so, creating a challenge in recognizing the endpoint of full comprehension.
</li><li><b>Shift from Human to God Identity</b>: The transition from seeing oneself as a human to fully accepting oneself as God was intensely transformative. Leo insists that any spiritual teaching that doesn't guide towards this realization of godhood is insufficient.
</li><li><b>Exploration of God's Mechanism</b>: He advocates for higher spiritual teachings that involve recognizing oneself as God, delving into God's infinity and nothingness, and understanding the mechanics and logic behind God's existence. Leo feels that this depth is often overlooked or undercommunicated by many spiritual teachers.
</li><li><b>Evolving Understanding and Future Exploration</b>: With numerous insights that he feels have yet to be fully articulated by other spiritual teachers, Leo is committed to sharing his advanced understandings and continuing to explore and experiment with the nature of consciousness and awakening.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Meditation and Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo concludes that traditional meditation and self–inquiry fall far short of the profound levels of consciousness he accessed with 5–MeO–DMT. Despite their value, these techniques alone couldn't provide the deep realizations he achieved.
</li><li><b>The Unmatched Potency of 5–MeO–DMT</b>: Leo expresses astonishment at the potency of 5–MeO–DMT and its unparalleled ability to facilitate deep consciousness and clarity, surpassing other psychedelics like LSD and mushrooms in its capacity to reveal the nature of God.
</li><li><b>Proper Application of 5–MeO–DMT</b>: He emphasizes the importance of a correct approach with 5–MeO–DMT for profound experiences. Leo plans to share his insights on the 'proper way' to use it, implying many practitioners do not experience its full potential due to misuse.
</li><li><b>Transformation Through Psychological Challenges</b>: Amidst his metaphysical awakening experiences, Leo encountered psychological trips that confronted him with personal issues impeding his understanding of God, such as his tendency to lie and be inauthentic.
</li><li><b>Authenticity as the Path to Truth</b>: Detailing a trip centered on truth and authenticity, Leo explains how he faced his lifelong pattern of dishonesty. He states that embodying God's nature requires embracing truth, as God has no fear and does not need to lie.
</li><li><b>Impact of Psychological Realizations</b>:
</li><li>Through confronting his lack of authenticity, the very next day Leo experienced a massive metaphysical awakening, suggesting addressing psychological barriers is crucial for further spiritual breakthroughs. 
</li><li><b>Qualifiers of His Teachings</b>:
</li><li>While Leo shares his spiritual realizations, he advises practitioners to continue meditation and other practices, especially if they lack access to psychedelics. He acknowledges varying degrees of awakening and does not disparage other teachers or teachings. 
</li><li><b>Incorporating a Religious Tone</b>: Leo explains that his teachings will assume a religious tone as he fully acknowledges his godliness. He clarifies this is not about converting to standard religious beliefs, but an honest expression of his experience–that reality is divine and good.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Divine Reality</b>: Leo positions the awakening to the divinity of reality as a transformation akin to a religious conversion, shifting one's life to align with the absolute goodness and divine nature of existence.
</li><li><b>Oneness with the Fractal Universe</b>: Leo experiences the sensation of being God within a fractal universe that extends infinitely in every direction, forming and residing within the eternal explosion of reality.
</li><li><b>Heaven as Present Reality</b>: Leo rejects the traditional notion of heaven as a far–off realm, instead equating heaven to the very moment and surroundings one is in, insisting that everything people see and experience is directly created by them and God.
</li><li><b>The Psychological Barrier to Heaven</b>: He discusses the idea that heaven and hell are states of mind rather than locations, emphasizing that an ego–driven mind prevents individuals from realizing they're already in heaven, thus creating their own psychological hell.
</li><li><b>Eternal Presence of Every Moment</b>: Leo introduces the concept that each moment of existence is eternal, much like frames on a movie reel, suggesting that every moment, including our earliest memories, coexists simultaneously in an eternal "frozen explosion."
</li><li><b>Infinity in All Things</b>: Leo highlights that every object, down to the details of our fingers, embodies an infinite fractal, with each object always positioned at the center of infinity, reinforcing the notion that infinity is not only about numbers but exists in all aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>Purposefulness of Creation</b>: He expounds on his realization that reality is not a random occurrence but a precise and intentional creation by an infinitely intelligent and powerful God, with physical laws, evolution, and patterns being elements of this deliberate design.
</li><li><b>Unlimited Nature of God</b>: Leo discusses the qualities of God as having no limitations, existing beyond physical and logical laws, emphasizing this unlimited nature to define the power, intelligence, and consciousness of God.
</li><li><b>Implications of God's Unlimited Power</b>: Describing an unlimited, all–powerful entity capable of willing anything into existence, Leo suggests that such beings can create realities that are infinitely intelligent and good, and that humans, in their truest, most unlimited form, would do the same.
</li><li><b>The Unlimited Nature of Reality</b>: Reality is described as an expression of infinite intelligence, goodness, and beauty created out of selflessness and love. What appears as negative or harmful events are, in actuality, parts of a meticulously designed universe that works for the greater good of all.
</li><li><b>Illusion of Randomness in the Universe</b>: Leo suggests that nothing in the universe is arbitrary or random; every detail is part of a grand design that interconnects all elements. This design is beyond the capacity of a limited human intellect to fully comprehend.
</li><li><b>Myopic Human Perspective</b>: Humans often judge events like tragedies from a narrow, self–centered view, not taking into account the vast interconnectedness of all events. Leo argues that what may seem as negative events to us play a necessary role in the optimal functioning of the universe as designed by an all–intelligent force.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Negative Events</b>: Even events perceived as deeply negative, such as mass shootings, are seen as having a place in the grand design of the universe. Leo claims that the removal of such events would, counterintuitively, lead to a worse overall creation from the perspective of infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Design Challenges and the Infinite Universe</b>: Leo draws parallels between human design challenges – like creating a website or engineering a product – and the infinitely more complex design of the universe. Every part of the universe, he argues, is connected through an intricate web of causation that results in a flawless design by what is understood as God.
</li><li><b>Understanding Causation</b>: Leo unfolds the concept of chains of causation, illustrating how every occurrence or decision can be traced back to an interconnected series of causes and effects stretching back through history and into the fabric of the universe itself, highlighting the complexity of universal design.
</li><li><b>Infinite Chains of Causation</b>: Each object or event is connected to an infinite number of other events, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the universe. The example of a butterfly's existence being influenced by countless factors both minute and cosmic is used to illustrate this concept.
</li><li><b>The Role of Design in Understanding Reality</b>: Leo suggests that when one grasives the difficulty of designing even simple objects, they can begin to appreciate the profound design of the universe. Everything, from the gravity affecting a butterfly to the chain of decisions leading to wearing a white shirt, reveals an intelligent, infinite causation at work.
</li><li><b>Science and Causation</b>: Leo points out that scientific analysis typically only addresses simple linear causation chains, like "A causes B causes C." This approach neglects the complex and interconnected nature of multiple causation chains that operate within even the simplest actions, like flexing a finger.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Scientific Understanding</b>: He emphasizes that while science is not false, it is extremely partial. Science fails to consider the holistic design and integration of chains of causation, which ripple through each other and contribute to the universe's intricate workings. Where science does touch upon this, as in chaos theory and fractals, it reveals some of its own limitations.
</li><li><b>Reality's Design Challenge</b>: Leo posits that the design of reality – which he considers pure goodness – could only be the work of an infinite, all–powerful, and all–intelligent entity. He suggests that "God" met this design challenge instantly, thanks to being unlimited in power, but humans struggle to see the intricacies due to selfishness and a lack of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Good vs Evil in God's Design</b>: Responding to questions about the presence of evil in the world, Leo clarifies that, in his view, God did not create bad things, only good. He reasons that infinite intelligence and selflessness would not allow for the creation of anything bad or evil; such perceptions are due to human limitations and fears, including the fear of death.
</li><li><b>Absolute Goodness of Existence</b>: Leo reinforces the idea that whatever exists is for the greater good of all, as existence itself is absolute goodness. He explains that humans often fail to see this because they are looking from a myopic, self–centred perspective, concerned with individual, rather than cosmic, good.
</li><li><b>The Problem of Human Perspective</b>: He expands on how the narrow focus of individuals on their personal benefit obscures the appreciation of the universe's absolute goodness and intelligent design. Humans often fail to understand the interconnectedness and perfect alignment of every aspect of existence.
</li><li><b>Existence vs Non–Existence</b>: Leo challenges the concept of non–existence by stating that everything that is perceivable or conceivable exists in some form, whether as an actual entity or as a concept. He suggests that non–existence is an illusion and that even the idea of non–existence exists within the realm of existence.
</li><li><b>Infinity and Pure Intelligence</b>: He separates the traditional idea of intelligence from what he refers to as "pure intelligence," which he equates with consciousness, truth, and love. Leo explains that consciousness is infinitely intelligent and that God, or pure consciousness, manifests effortlessly into form, as observed when examining one's own hand.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Universe</b>: Leo shares his conviction that after rigorous spiritual practice, an individual can become fully conscious of the reasons for existence and the workings of the universe, which to him are designed with pure intelligence and love, contrary to the notions of randomness suggested by interpretations of quantum mechanics.
</li><li><b>Pursuit of Metaphysical Understanding</b>: He encourages those with a philosophical bent and deep curiosity about the universe to continue questioning and seeking understanding, which he believes is attainable through persistent effort, beyond logical reasoning or traditional studies, and may involve transformative practices like psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Interconnection of Love and Truth</b>: Leo reflects on the insight that love and truth are synonymous, expressing that everything occurring right now is both an act of love and the ultimate truth. This realization, accessed through profound experiences, implies a highly idealistic view of existence that may appear unrealistically good from a typical human standpoint.
</li><li><b>Open–Mindedness in Spiritual Practice</b>: Leo insists on the importance of persevering in the exploration of spirituality without ceasing prematurely. The further one explores, the more one realizes the infinite goodness at the end of the journey.
</li><li><b>Embodiment of Goodness</b>: After realizing the infinite goodness, the next step Leo sees for himself is to become a living example of this goodness, aligning his life with it to bring positive transformation to the world.
</li><li><b>No Claim to Superior Enlightenment</b>: Leo clarifies that he is not claiming to be the most enlightened person, but acknowledges he has accessed rare spiritual experiences that are challenging to attain, which he considers himself fortunate to have experienced.
</li><li><b>Continuous Work Towards Awakening</b>: Leo conveys that despite his experiences, he does not consider himself fully awake or enlightened, and still has a significant path ahead to achieve full awakening and liberation.
</li><li><b>Integration of Spiritual and Ordinary Life</b>: He discusses the paradoxical nature of spiritual highs, which exist alongside ordinary life with all its mundane challenges and frustrations, such as financial concerns and daily annoyances.
</li><li><b>Ongoing Struggle with Ego</b>: Leo admits to still dealing with human limitations such as bad habits, fears, and a sense of ego that continues to cause suffering, part of the human experience that he shares with everyone.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Awakening and Liberation</b>: He differentiates between having an awakening experience and achieving constant god consciousness or total liberation, with the latter being much more difficult to maintain and the true aim of his spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Passion for Spiritual Work</b>: Leo shares his increasing passion for continuing the work of integrating his spiritual insights, and his goal to internalize these insights in a more organic and authentic manner, fully surrendering to the divine within.
</li><li><b>Holistic Approach to Spirituality</b>: He stresses the need for spirituality to become a natural part of life, fully integrated into every action and being lived in an authentic, organic way.
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Transformation</b>: Leo emphasizes his desire to be more authentic in his life and teaching, to work on embodying his insights more deeply, and to communicate them in a pure and powerful way.
</li><li><b>Upcoming Teachings and Insights</b>: He outlines plans to share his progress and insights, tweaking and upgrading his teachings based on his evolving understanding.
</li><li><b>Natural Evolution of Teaching</b>: Leo explains his approach to teaching will become more embodied and less technical, though he will continue to provide analytical content.
</li><li><b>A New Chapter Toward Total Liberation</b>: He reveals his transition from focusing on business success to pursuing total awakening and liberation, expecting this journey to take several years, and expressing uncertainty yet openness about what lies beyond this pursuit.
</li><li><b>Inspiration for Others to Seek Awakening</b>: Lastly, Leo hopes to inspire listeners to embark on their own spiritual journies, assuring that his revelations are meant to serve as a catalyst for others to seek similar experiences.
