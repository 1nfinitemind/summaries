            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/total-omniscience-awakening' target='_blank'>Total Omniscience Awakening</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Significant revelations</strong> : Leo expresses that recent profound awakenings have challenged the foundation of Actualized.org, leading him to reconsider his prior teachings as ultimately nonsensical given his new realizations.</li>
<li><strong>Existence through imagination</strong> : He describes his realization that everything, including the universe and personal experiences like birth and death, is imagined into existence. This omnipresent imagination is unlimited and manifests all aspects of perceived reality.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite consciousness unteachable</strong> : Leo shares a belief that the omniscience he has reached is not attainable through meditation, self-inquiry, or other spiritual practices, and therefore cannot be taught or explained through conventional means.</li>
<li><strong>Detachment from spiritual structures</strong> : He repudiates traditional spiritual teachings and explains that he envisions all religious figures and spiritual authorities as his own creation, thus rejecting their external power.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy as a source of truth</strong> : Leo contends that recognizing oneself as the sole creator and authority on truth is a daunting task for many, but it is a necessary step to fully grasp one's divine nature and power.</li>
<li><strong>Pathology of projected authority</strong> : He discusses how individuals project their own divine power onto external authority figures, leading to a disconnection from their own omnipotence and a distortion of self-perception.</li>
<li><strong>Self-imposed authority</strong> : People assign their inherent authority to external figures, like religious leaders or scientists, without realizing they are the ultimate judges of their own reality.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism of belief via imagination</strong> : Leo describes how individuals can believe in something by imagining it and then further imagining it as real, causing a belief to manifest and feel authentic.</li>
<li><strong>Intention to revolutionize teachings</strong> : He intends to completely reformulate his teachings, acknowledging they might contradict previous notions and could be perceived as insanity but are aligned with his truth.</li>
<li><strong>Radical self-love and the denial of evil</strong> : Leo discusses a level of self-love so profound that it dismisses moral judgments, allowing all actions to come from a place of love, and questions the traditional concept of evil.</li>
<li><strong>Self-acceptance and societal norms</strong> : He reflects on how societal moral standards lead to denial and rejection of one's desires, claiming that total self-acceptance is the path to inner peace.</li>
<li><strong>Immortality and the illusion of time</strong> : Leo shares the realization that life is an eternal present moment, with the past and future being imaginative constructs.</li>
<li><strong>Oneness with all existence</strong> : He expresses an inability to distinguish between himself and objects around him, like a brick wall, noting everything is imagined equally.</li>
<li><strong>Imagining physicality</strong> : Leo argues that even our physical bodies and bones are products of imagination, likening the perception of dense physical objects to a deeper level of imaginative experience.</li>
<li><strong>Relativity of scale in reality</strong> : He describes reality as having no true scale, where the size of objects is relative and can be perceived differently based on our focus, challenging the concept of fixed size in the universe.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite scalability of reality</strong> : Reality can be infinitely zoomed in or out, revealing that all objects are the same size at different scales; this understanding leads to the profound realization that everything is infinitely divisible and everything is one.</li>
<li><strong>Experiencing life as God</strong> : By adopting a cosmic perspective and stripping away perceived scales, one can glimpse the experience of being God who sees everything as equal and interconnected parts of the cosmos.</li>
<li><strong>Unifying qualities in infinite consciousness</strong> : In the state of infinite consciousness, distinctions between love, being, will, power, intelligence, creativity, and knowledge disappear as they unify into total oneness.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor of reality as an infinite ball of yarn</strong> : Reality is likened to an infinitely growing, complex ball of yarn that encompasses all dimensions, including time and space, suggesting the impossibility of fully explaining or understanding reality through any single viewpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of human perspective</strong> : Ordinary life and understanding, including scientific and spiritual teachings, are merely one limited slice of the infinitely dimensional reality, leading to an incomplete picture of existence.</li>
<li><strong>The challenge of conveying infinite consciousness</strong> : Explaining the nature of infinite consciousness is difficult because it involves experiencing all perspectives simultaneously, a radical departure from the norm that cannot be fully communicated.</li>
<li><strong>Future of Leo's teachings</strong> : Leo forecasts a radical shift in his consciousness and an evolution of his teachings, which may become more unique and potentially contradict earlier content as he integrates his new understanding of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching as an act of self-expression</strong> : Leo expresses uncertainty about the future of his teachings, suggesting they may not adhere to conventional formats and that he will prioritize self-understanding over producing content.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance of radical truth and its implications</strong> : Leo acknowledges the difficulties in accepting the radical truth of being God and the potential controversial nature of his teachings in a world accustomed to illusion.</li>
