            <ul>
    <li><b>Polarizing reactions to awakening content</b>: Leo notices that his total awakening live video has generated various reactions, revealing the video's polarizing effect. He expresses no interest in defending himself against judgmental comments, instead addressing serious practitioners regarding the true nature of awakening.
</li><li><b>Awakening misconception due to serene gurus</b>: He critiques the misleading calmness portrayed by spiritual gurus, which contrasts sharply with the chaotic reality of a fresh awakening experience. Leo explains that this calm appearance results from decades of post–awakening integration and mastery, not the initial tumultuous journey.
</li><li><b>Contrasting the mythologized and historical Jesus</b>: Leo examines the idealized versus the historical Jesus, showing discrepancies that challenge common beliefs about enlightened beings. He highlights that the historical Jesus displayed strong emotions, countering the expectation that awakened individuals must conform to peaceful ideals.
</li><li><b>Raw emotions in awakening</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of passion and a full emotional range during awakening, contradicting the notion that these are egoic traits. He argues that awakening intensifies emotions rather than suppresses them, illustrating that genuine passion is integral to the process.
</li><li><b>Heightened consciousness during awakening</b>: Addressing misconceptions, Leo explains that during the pinnacle of awakening, trivial matters are insignificant due to the universal scope of the consciousness experienced, regardless of societal expectations or norms.
</li><li><b>Navigating judgment post–awakening</b>: Leo addresses the scrutiny and negativity one may face from others after awakening, including accusations of selfishness or insanity. He notes the importance of perseverance and the courage to face and integrate these challenges.
</li><li><b>Reality of spiritual work</b>: He shares selective raw clips to give a more accurate representation of spiritual work, acknowledging that most of his experiences go unseen. Leo encourages letting go of illusory ideas about awakening and God.
</li><li><b>Critiquing religious moralization</b>: Leo criticizes the cherry–picking of virtuous actions by religious standards, asserting that such moralization constricts the understanding of God and awakening. He refutes the expectation of perpetual silence or selflessness as misunderstandings of the awakened state.
</li><li><b>Sharing the awakening experience</b>: Leo justifies sharing his awakening moments as expressions of divine love, not narcissism. He argues that an awakened individual seeks to share their profound realizations out of an innate desire to impart the beauty and amazement of their experience.
</li><li><b>Variability in awakening experiences</b>: Leo conveys that awakenings can range from highly ecstatic and passionate to being very silent and somber, emphasizing that there are many expressive possibilities within awakenings, not just overwhelmingly positive ones.
</li><li><b>Infinity and transcendence in awakening</b>: Leo describes an awakening experience where he transcended all known concepts, such as life and death, entering states of consciousness that defy traditional understanding and categories, leading to an indescribable void of pure consciousness.
</li><li><b>Differentiating spiritual work from mental health issues</b>: Leo clarifies the difference between the transformative fallout of awakening and mental health disorders, asserting the importance of distinguishing between them and seeking appropriate help if needed.
</li><li><b>Embracing individual spiritual paths</b>: Encouraging viewers to honor their unique spiritual journey, Leo highlights that an individual's path should not merely mimic others and acknowledges his role in pioneering new ways of accessing and understanding the divine.
