            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/tapping-into-collective-consciousness' target='_blank'>Tapping Into Collective Consciousness</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>New consciousness exploration</b>: Leo delves into collective consciousness, advancing beyond personal awareness. He perceives reality as embodying a layered, hierarchical structure reminiscent of a corporation, where one might connect with higher, collective aspects beyond individual consciousness.
</li><li><b>Materialism vs. collective experience</b>: He challenges materialist reductionism, advocating for a broader perspective where the collective, interconnected consciousness, such as that of the entire human race, is conceivable when recognizing the universe as an imagination within God's infinite mind.
</li><li><b>Contemplating humanity's trajectory</b>: In expansive states of consciousness, Leo suggests that time becomes irrelevant and one can illuminate different aspects of universal knowledge. He shares an extraordinary experience of shining his awareness on mankind's collective aspects and the consciousness of all current fetuses on Earth, aiming to influence their future openness and awakening.
</li><li><b>Reality and imagination convergence</b>: In heightened states of consciousness, Leo claims that the distinction between reality and imagination vanishes, making it possible to potentially influence reality through the power of imagination and intention.
</li><li><b>Individual influence limitations</b>: Leo discusses the universe's design that restricts individuals from wielding enough power to make significant, arbitrary changes to reality, preventing potential abuses and maintaining order within the cosmic structure.
</li><li><b>Selflessness in higher consciousness</b>: Reaching profound levels of consciousness eliminates selfish intentions, according to Leo. He describes an experience filled with love for all creation, intending to bless and improve the world selflessly, resonating with God's creative intent.
</li><li><b>Miracles and spirituality</b>: Leo discusses the myths and stories of miracles within Christianity and other mystical traditions, acknowledging that while some may be false or exaggerated, others could be based on real feats achieved by accessing deep levels of consciousness far beyond typical enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Selflessness in high consciousness states</b>: He emphasizes that actions taken from these high states of consciousness are infused with an infinite love stemming from a universal source. This selfless state eliminates any notion of evil intent, focusing instead on contributing positively to all of creation.
</li><li><b>Healing with imagination</b>: Leo suggests that healing at these levels does not require physical intervention but is achieved through the power of imagination. He proposes that by tapping into unlimited intelligence, one can envision and, therefore, change the health and well–being of others, regardless of the physical distance or time.
</li><li><b>The abstract nature of imagination</b>: He explains that imagination is not confined to concrete entities but can encompass abstract collectives, such as all of humanity. This allows for impacting larger wholes, similar to understanding humanity as a hand with billions of interconnected digits.
</li><li><b>Purpose after awakening</b>: Leo identifies the purpose of life post–awakening as serving creation in alignment with God. He dictates that to engage effectively in such a divine service, one must reach a state of purity and complete alignment with God, moving beyond personal desires and living as a vessel for God's work on Earth.
</li><li><b>Life as God incarnate</b>: After awakening, one's life should be dedicated to contributing to the world as God himself would–selflessly, without personal gain. This can manifest in various ways, from healing and teaching to art and leadership, with the underlying motivation being to demonstrate and inspire with divine love.
</li><li><b>The utility of awakened life</b>: Leo proposes that the most meaningful way to use one's time on Earth is to embody God's infinite goodness and love, going beyond seeking personal awakening. He encourages a shift in perspective from personal gratification to living as a reflection of God's will and benevolence in one's actions and creations.
</li><li><b>Synergy between individual contributions and collective impact</b>: Leo illustrates how individual efforts, like streams, come together to form a larger collective force, much like rivers merging into an Amazon–sized entity. This metaphor highlights the potential for individual actions to contribute to grander societal or even cosmic endeavors.
</li><li><b>Service without obligation</b>: He encourages serving the greater good without feeling obligated, suggesting that true joy and fulfillment come when one contributes selflessly to the world, serving mankind, the earth, or the cosmos, aligned with one's higher consciousness and understanding of their role.
</li><li><b>Living selflessly as God's messenger</b>: Leo describes how a heightened state of consciousness can transform a person into a messenger of God on Earth, where their actions, regardless of profession, express divine love and contribute meaningfully to the betterment of creation without explicitly discussing God.
</li><li><b>Creative and varied expressions of sainthood</b>: He criticizes strictly ascetic spiritual practices for their lack of applicability to societal living, proposing a more expansive vision of sainthood that includes a variety of creative and societal contributions, echoing the Christian mystical tradition of performing good works.
</li><li><b>Necessity for societal transformation</b>: Emphasizing the need to reflect the love and goodness of God in all societal facets, Leo advocates for a broader participation of enlightened individuals in various fields, beyond traditional teaching roles, to help transform society holistically.
</li><li><b>Inspiration for spiritual work</b>: Leo shares his personal motivation for spiritual practice, revolving around a deep desire to understand and embody the universal truth, creativity, and love. He encourages finding a positive and visionary purpose to fuel the demanding journey towards higher consciousness and godlike creation.
</li><li><b>Critique of negative motivation</b>: He critiques the pursuit of enlightenment solely to escape suffering, arguing that such negative motivation fails to reach the highest levels of consciousness. Instead, he champions positive motivations like seeking truth, understanding, beauty, and a desire to contribute to the greater good as the proper drive for spiritual growth.
