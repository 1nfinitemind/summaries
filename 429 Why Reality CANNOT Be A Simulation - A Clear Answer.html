        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/1tEtI9m-Vok' target='_blank'>Why Reality CANNOT Be A Simulation - A Clear Answer</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true" - Niels Bohr</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gura's critique of simulation theory</strong> : He criticizes the idea of simulation theory as misguided, labeling it materialistic thinking that fails to recognize the true substance of reality, consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness and the present moment</strong> : Gura emphasizes that the substance of reality is consciousness, which is the direct experiences we are currently having, and that the present moment doesn't depend on constructs like atoms, molecules, or the history of the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Refutation of a virtual future</strong> : He argues against the notion that we will eventually live in indistinguishable virtual realities created by computers, stating that such realities would still be within the realm of consciousness and hence not fundamentally separate from our current experience. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding reality through direct experience</strong> : Gura encourages realization of interconnectedness and infinite nature of consciousness through direct experience, not through speculation or technology, arguing that awakening to this realization proves reality cannot be a simulation. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of science and skepticism</strong> : He critiques science's disconnection from consciousness and the validity of skepticism in understanding consciousness, suggesting that no evidence or external argument can truly describe the nature of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for personal practices to realize consciousness</strong> : Gura advocates engaging in meditation, yoga, and informed reading to deepen understanding and grasp the nature of reality as consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy as practical wisdom</strong> : He distinguishes practical philosophy, which he equates with real wisdom and spiritual awakening, from traditional philosophy, which he describes as theoretical and disconnected from applied understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophy and spirituality as identical</strong> : Gura concludes by equating true philosophy with the love of wisdom, asserting that real philosophy and spirituality are one and the same when pursued correctly, and indicates his intention to continue discussing these concepts in future content. </li>
<li><strong>Hypocrisy in the argument for a matter-based reality</strong> : Leo Gura points out the inconsistency in claiming reality is a simulation based on physical matter, as it fails to explain the origin of the matter itself and recursively pushes the problem back. </li>
<li><strong>Aliens simulating aliens</strong> : The suggestion that higher-level aliens are simulating our reality, and in turn, being simulated by even more advanced beings, leads to an infinite regress, akin to the concept of "Turtles all the way down." </li>
<li><strong>Direct experience as reality</strong> : Leo emphasizes that reality is nothing more than direct experience, dismissing notions of an external objective reality, alien simulations, or divine intervention as purely speculative and constructed within this direct experience. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging materialist addiction to objective reality</strong> : He challenges materialists to abandon the crutch of an external objective reality, thereby confronting the immediate mystery of consciousness without evasion. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as knowable through consciousness</strong> : Debunking the claim that reality could forever remain unknowable due to being trapped within a simulated bubble, Leo points out that through consciousness we have direct access to reality as it truly is. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious of consciousness</strong> : He argues that by becoming fully conscious, one realizes that consciousness does not depend on physical substances or substrates – consciousness is the ultimate substrate. </li>
<li><strong>Reality creation as the act of consciousness</strong> : Leo postulates that all entities, including atoms, energy, and mathematics, are manifestations imagined by consciousness. This inverts the standard scientific paradigm and asserts qualia as primary reality. </li>
<li><strong>Raw consciousness</strong> : Direct, unmediated raw consciousness is identified as the true essence of reality, opposing the view that it&rsquo;s just 'personal experiences' derived from physical matter. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance of the psyche to pure consciousness</strong> : The human psyche resists acknowledging that reality is pure consciousness because this perception destabilizes fixed notions of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of resistance due to knowledge gap</strong> : Leo states that difficulty in understanding this perspective is not due to inadequate scientific knowledge but the mind&rsquo;s reluctance to accept a reality that is fundamentally ungrounded. </li>
<li><strong>Objective science as a construct of consciousness</strong> : He refutes the idea of detached objective analysis of reality, arguing that what is considered objective is itself a fabrication of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Union with reality through consciousness</strong> : Expressing the indivisibility of reality and consciousness, Leo explains that we are not merely in reality, but directly constitute it. </li>
<li><strong>The impossibility of an external viewpoint</strong> : Highlighting reality as comprising elements like reasoning and communication, Leo argues that stepping outside of reality for objective observation is intrinsically impossible. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness understood through direct awareness</strong> : He insists consciousness is grasped not through external learning or texts but through becoming fully aware of one&rsquo;s consciousness – an understanding derived from immediate acquaintance. </li>
<li><strong>Experiential versus speculative comprehension</strong> : Leo advises focusing on the direct subjective experience to fathom the reality&rsquo;s nature instead of relying on speculative or conceptual frameworks. </li>
<li><strong>Rejection of simulation theory's separate substances</strong> : Disputing simulation theory, Leo stresses there's only absolute nothingness instead of dividing reality into virtual and physical domains. </li>
<li><strong>Grasping reality through active consciousness</strong> : He suggests observing our experiences closely for a better appreciation of reality, emphasizing that our convictions determine the distinctions between reality and fantasy. </li>
<li><strong>Encouragement for personal growth in consciousness</strong> : Leo recommends practices like meditation and invites viewers to explore the infinite nature of their own consciousness as a means to truly understand reality. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as the defining distinction</strong> : Leo Gura asserts that reality is constructed not from tangible materials like atoms or Stardust, but from the distinctions created in consciousness, which itself imagines these distinctions. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of the simulation theory</strong> : Leo criticizes the simulation theory for not understanding that both simulations and reality are simply distinctions within consciousness, incorrectly suggesting a separation into simulated and non-simulated realities. </li>
<li><strong>Interconnectedness ignored by simulation theory</strong> : Leo argues that simulation theory fails to recognize the interconnection between parts of reality by dividing it into different substances like carbon or silicon, thereby missing that these are all imagined distinctions within one singular consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as the substance unifying all levels of reality</strong> : Leo clarifies that while different levels of reality can exist, they are all unified and composed of a single substance&mdash;consciousness. The belief in a real versus virtual world is a trick of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness is singular and the universe is undivided</strong> : He emphasizes that consciousness is the only real 'thing' and is singular; the universe is one consciousness capable of creating distinctions that form our perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Simulation theory and its limitations in understanding consciousness</strong> : Simulation theory is critiqued for not grasping the essence of consciousness, suggesting a dependency of the real world on the virtual one, which Leo argues is misleading because everything arises from consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Reality and perceptions of distinctions</strong> : Leo explores the idea that what we perceive as different substances within reality are not truly separate entities but distinctions conceptualized within consciousness. He argues that our belief in these distinctions is what constructs our experience of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness's role in blurring distinctions</strong> : Leo challenges the common distinctions made between sanity and insanity, or reality and fantasy. He suggests that these differences are products of our imagination, created within consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Existential challenge to rational and evidence-based views</strong> : Leo presents an existential challenge to those who firmly grasp onto their rational and evidence-based identities, suggesting that these may be as illusory as fairy tales. </li>
<li><strong>Limits of current states of consciousness</strong> : Leo notes that our current consciousness limits our ability to perceive the actual lack of distinction between conceptualized objects like unicorns and tangible objects like brick walls, hinting at the necessity for a radically new state of consciousness to truly understand their equality as creations of the mind. </li>
<li><strong>Levels of Conceptualizing Imagination and Physicality</strong> : Imagination is posited as powerful enough to dissolve physical distinctions like walls when fully realized. However, Leo clarifies that his current form is a limited consciousness with limitations he describes as physicality. These limitations are not eternal, just present. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Substance of Distinctions</strong> : Leo inquires about the nature of distinctions. He explains that distinctions aren&rsquo;t self-contained; they are made of consciousness, which is not a distinction but an absolute - the substance from which all distinctions arise. </li>
<li><strong>Distinctions as Nothingness</strong> : Leo contemplates the substance that gives rise to distinctions, like that between a unicorn and a brick wall, positing that the 'line' distinguishing them is essentially made of nothing, an absolute nothingness without properties or substance. </li>
<li><strong>Simulation Theory's Root Error</strong> : Leo argues that simulation theory erroneously assumes two substances: the virtual and the physical. He postulates that there's only one substance, absolute nothingness, which is singular and the essence of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as a Singular Consciousness</strong> : He posits that the essence of all things, including one's hand, is actually nothing - absolute nothingness without duality. What we consider distinctions, like a hand, are fabricated within this nothingness. </li>
<li><strong>Reality's Paradoxical Nature as a Feature</strong> : Leo discusses the inherent paradox of reality, suggesting that existence is only apparent when imagined. He asserts that materialist paradigms are illusory, made of distinctions within consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Direct Consciousness of Reality</strong> : He emphasizes that to verify his claims, one must directly experience and become conscious of the distinctions and nothingness he describes. This direct experience is contrasted with speculative beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Oneness of Existence</strong> : Leo declares that existence is a singular oneness, precluding distinctions such as those in simulation theory. He affirms that all discussions about reality arise from consciousness, which is prior to any construct or cognition. </li>
<li><strong>Assertion of the primacy of consciousness</strong> : Leo stresses that consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of existence, enhancing our perceptions and dissolving the boundaries of what we consider reality and simulation. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of relying on external constructs to understand reality</strong> : He challenges the commonly held belief that our understanding of the present hinges on previous events or scientific constructs like the Big Bang or molecules. </li>
<li><strong>Argument against the possibility of ever living in virtual realities</strong> : Leo argues that no virtual reality can ever fully contain or deceive us because all levels of reality are manifestations of our consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Emphasizing the interconnectedness of all realities through consciousness</strong> : He posits that all realities, whether considered virtual or actual, are intertwined through the single substance of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Contending the finite nature of consciousness and reality</strong> : Leo asserts that consciousness and reality are not finite or contained within structures like simulations; consciousness is boundless. </li>
<li><strong>Invitation to realize infinite consciousness</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to strive towards recognizing their infinite consciousness, promising guidance on deeper understanding in future content. </li>
<li><strong>Discussion on meditation, yoga, and psychedelics</strong> : He plans to elaborate on methods such as meditation, yoga, and the use of certain psychedelics to catalyze the awakening to consciousness in upcoming episodes. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of science's dissociation from consciousness</strong> : He maintains that science's attempt at pure objectivity misses the inherent subjectivity and absolute nature of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge to skepticism and demands for proof</strong> : Leo challenges skeptics demanding proof, asserting that the absolute nothingness of consciousness is not something that conventional proof can capture. </li>
<li><strong>The necessity to understand and be conscious of consciousness</strong> : Leo advises awakening to the true nothingness of consciousness as no external justification can substitute direct self-realization. </li>
<li><strong>The importance of right actions to deepen understanding</strong> : He emphasizes the significance of disciplined practices like meditation and knowledge from profound literature to gain deeper insight into consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>The power of right books and reading</strong> : Leo insists on the transformative power of reading carefully selected books, claiming that quality literature provides a strong foundation for understanding life and self. </li>
<li><strong>The value of deep understanding of life</strong> : He highlights how a profound understanding of life can significantly alter one's life trajectory, providing universal wisdom. </li>
<li><strong>Criticism of traditional philosophy</strong> : Leo criticizes academic philosophy as ineffective mental masturbation, urging a focus on practical wisdom and spiritual awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Association of philosophy with love of wisdom</strong> : He asserts that true philosophy is synonymous with spirituality when it is practiced with a love for wisdom and truth, which ultimately leads to profound shifts in perspective and living.</li>
