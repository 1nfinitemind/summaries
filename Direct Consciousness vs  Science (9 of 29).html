            <ul>
    <li><b>Differentiation between direct insights and scientific knowledge</b>: Leo emphasizes the vast difference between direct insights and scientific knowledge, stating that knowledge is something that is accumulated and learned, while consciousness is an innate aspect of being that goes beyond mere knowledge.
</li><li><b>Pervasiveness of scientific and rationalist thinking</b>: Leo acknowledges that scientific and rational thought dominate society to the extent that concepts not fitting the scientific paradigm are often disregarded and not taken seriously in many circles.
</li><li><b>Historical conflict between science and religion</b>: Leo recognizes that science had to differentiate itself from religion to survive during its early stages, which led to a general assumption within science that direct consciousness was not possible, favoring indirect knowledge acquired through experimentation.
</li><li><b>Possibility of direct consciousness</b>: Leo suggests that while the scientific community has primarily focused on indirect knowledge, it does not invalidate the possibility of direct consciousness, even though it falls outside the traditional scope of experimental science.
</li><li><b>Nature of direct consciousness with objects</b>: Leo explains that direct consciousness doesn't involve literally becoming an object, like a cup, but instead involves an understanding or grasp of reality as if one is united with the object in a profound way that changes the conventional perception of the self.
