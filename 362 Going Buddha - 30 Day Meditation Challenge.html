            <ul>
    <li><b>Deepening awakening after Hawaii</b>: Following his retreat in Hawaii, Leo had an intensely profound awakening due to an experience with 5–MeO–DMT, surpassing his previous spiritual insights and making him realize his divine oneness, which he defines as 'God mode'.
</li><li><b>Elimination of suffering and selfhood</b>: In this state, Leo felt a complete dissolution of all problems and personal identity, entering a reality where the concept of suffering became unrecognizable. Selfhood was eradicated as if it never existed, revealing an unobstructed view of absolute reality.
</li><li><b>Literal omniscience realization</b>: Leo's awakening brought forth an understanding not confined to scientific knowledge but an innate, interconnected understanding of existence beyond facts, which he labels 'true omniscience'.
</li><li><b>Commitment to surrender</b>: Amidst this awakening experience, Leo made a decision to totally surrender his life to the awakening, planning to begin a 30–day intense meditation at home with the objective of permanently entering 'God mode' and ending personal identity.
</li><li><b>Difficult decision affecting Actualized.org</b>: Leo contemplates on how creating content for Actualized.org, although enlightening, keeps him within a conceptual frame that hinders deeper spiritual progression, which led to his decision to retreat.
</li><li><b>Isolation retreat details</b>: Leo's retreat in solitude will exclude all social interaction and distractions like business, internet, and even grocery shopping, kept to a minimum. The focus is on nothingness and surrender to the emptiness.
</li><li><b>End goals of the retreat</b>: Leo aims to annihilate personhood, eliminate all fears and boredom, and achieve a 'no–mind state–silent, analytical–free mind–as described by Zen masters.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org operations continuity</b>: While new content will be paused, the website, store, and forum will remain operational, with Leo still available for critical technical support, intending to film weekly videos to reflect on his retreat insights.
</li><li><b>Enhancing teachings and future content</b>: Leo plans to return with enriched teachings, intending to embody his advice more deeply to improve his effectiveness as a teacher and is eager to cover broader topics on Actualized.org after his retreat.
</li><li><b>Handling administrative aspects</b>: Despite the retreat, Leo will manage necessary administrative tasks like tech support and billing once per week without disrupting his meditative focus, ensuring Actualized.org's smooth operation.
</li><li><b>Anticipated content for Actualized.org</b>: Leo is looking forward to covering numerous profound topics such as the nature of science, language, chaos theory, perception, causality, consciousness, and its various levels and facets. He plans to explore these topics with detailed insights and teachings, drawing from his profound experiences.
</li><li><b>Focus on emotional mastery</b>: Leo expresses his intent to create deep content on emotions like fear, anger, guilt, shame, and boredom, aiming to help viewers understand these emotions and how they might be unconsciously running their lives.
</li><li><b>Integration of insights from retreats</b>: He eagerly anticipates integrating comprehensive insights gained from recent personal retreats, including his Hawaii retreat and the upcoming 30–day solo retreat, which will enrich the teachings on Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Excitement and fear about the solo retreat</b>: Leo shares his mixed feelings about the solo retreat; he's both excited to advance to a profound level of practice and a bit frightened due to unknown outcomes, given that this will be his longest self–guided retreat. 
</li><li><b>Surrendering positive attachments</b>: Acknowledging the growth and attachment to Actualized.org, Leo recognizes the need to surrender even positive habits in order to reach deeper levels of awakening and to face inherent fears associated with letting go.
</li><li><b>Call to action for viewers</b>: Leo encourages viewers to not just consume the content passively but to actively engage in the practices he's shared, to invest in self–growth, and to make concrete plans for their own personal development.
</li><li><b>Challenges for different life stages</b>: He speaks about the difficulties of committing to personal growth for both younger and older individuals, emphasizing the relative ease for younger people due to less social conditioning and urging all viewers to be strategic and dedicated to their growth journey.
