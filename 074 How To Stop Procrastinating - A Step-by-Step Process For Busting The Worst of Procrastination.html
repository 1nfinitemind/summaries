        <ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Procrastination</strong> : Leo describes procrastination as resistance to actions or tasks, which occurs when we label activities with "should," "must," or "need." This labeling creates internal resistance and leads to procrastination. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance as a Choice</strong> : The feeling of resistance is self-created, not inherent to the task. By viewing tasks as choices rather than obligations, acknowledging we "could" do them rather than we "should" or "must," we can lower our internal resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Allowing Yourself to Feel Resistance</strong> : Recognizing and allowing oneself to feel the resistance, rather than avoiding it, can diminish its intensity. Understanding that our anticipation is often worse than taking action helps mitigate the paralyzing effects of procrastination. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Sedona Method</strong> : Leo recommends the Sedona Method to release the tension of resistance by acknowledging the feeling, asking oneself if it can be let go, and deciding to let it go now if possible. Repeating this process helps numb resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Positive Aspects with Sedona Method</strong> : Reverse Sedona involves generating excitement about the resisted activity by finding a positive aspect or element of the task to look forward to, which can help to overshadow the resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Visualization as a Tool</strong> : Visualizing the task, especially starting it, in detailed and positive terms, is suggested to overcome the initial resistance. It's crucial to visualize the first steps as these are often the hardest to initiate. </li>
<li><strong>Observing the Act of Procrastinating</strong> : Becoming an observer of one's own procrastination can cause a shift in awareness. By watching oneself procrastinate without immediate intervention, the desire to change one&rsquo;s actions can naturally arise. </li>
<li><strong>Baby Steps Approach</strong> : In dealing with procrastination, Leo advises starting with small, incremental actions (baby steps) to gradually reduce resistance and build momentum toward completing the larger task. </li>
<li><strong>Additional Procrastination Resources</strong> : Leo notes that more strategies and tools to combat procrastination, as well as broader topics on self-improvement and emotional mastery, can be found on his website, Actualized.org.</li>
