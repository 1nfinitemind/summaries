            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/8dVa6_e9FWw' target='_blank'>Mankind Is The Bullshitting Animal</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Motivation for Big Picture Understanding</b>: Leo stresses his commitment to a high–level understanding of life and society's workings, having studied arrays of models and frameworks.
</li><li><b>Epiphany on Mankind's Nature</b>: The straightforward yet profound epiphany Leo shares is that mankind is fundamentally full of shit, a simple insight with extensive explanatory power.
</li><li><b>Rant Disclaimer</b>: Despite the use of vulgar language in a rant–like manner, Leo urges the audience to see the profoundness of his message rather than getting distracted by the style of delivery.
</li><li><b>Across–the–board Bullshit</b>: Leo elaborates by listing various institutions, belief systems, and types of people, uniformly declaring them all “full of shit.” The list encompasses religions, sciences, academic fields, governments, economic systems, media, small talk, relationships, family structures, society, and much more.
</li><li><b>Bullshit Denial</b>: He notes that people tend to recognize bullshit in others but make exceptions for themselves, which contributes to societal chaos.
</li><li><b>Self–Delusion Confrontation</b>: Leo's goal is to confront the self–delusion that individuals maintain, emphasizing the sophisticated game of acknowledging the bullshit everywhere except within oneself.
</li><li><b>Denial of Personal Bullshit</b>: Connecting with the audience, Leo acknowledges that people may agree with him on many points, but tend to deny that the things they value are full of shit, further driving his point that this very denial is particularly full of shit.
</li><li><b>Chaos Resulting from Denial</b>: Leo connects the widespread denial of personal bullshit to the chaos observed in the world, highlighting it as the source of societal issues and conflicts.
</li><li><b>The Inherent Nature of Bullshit</b>: Leo Gura points out the omnipresence of bullshit in all aspects of human creation, from Wall Street to various professions like doctors and lawyers, and emphasizes the need to recognize this in order to understand why society operates the way it does.
</li><li><b>Mankind as the Best at Bullshitting</b>: Leo illustrates that humans excel at bullshitting, and this skill is the foundation upon which human society is constructed. He attributes the capacity for producing bullshit to the human mind, especially the ego.
</li><li><b>Bullshit and Ego</b>: The connection between the ego and bullshit is expounded, with Leo articulating how the ego corrupts everything it touches, thus leading to corruption and bullshit in every human endeavor.
</li><li><b>Importance Correlates with Bullshit</b>: Leo introduces the principle that the level of importance and the amount of bullshit are interlinked, as the concept of importance is relative to how much something contributes to an individual's survival.
</li><li><b>Survival Drives Bullshit</b>: Survival is highlighted as the primary concern driving humans to engage in bullshit, with the ego's survival mechanism influencing the varying degrees that one might do so across different life domains.
</li><li><b>Human Institutions and Survival</b>: Leo argues that human institutions are fragile constructs bonded by bullshit, and that their continuity is integral to our survival, positing that the collapse of bullshitting would have a direct impact on our lives.
</li><li><b>Call for Empirical Validation</b>: Rather than just agreeing or becoming cynical, Leo urges viewers to empirically verify the prevalence of bullshit in society by observing and questioning various institutions and domains.
</li><li><b>Nuances in the Degree of Bullshit</b>: Leo clarifies that not everyone is equally "full of shit," calling for a nuanced understanding and development of a "bullshit radar" to navigate through life intelligently.
</li><li><b>Bullshit, Truth, and Development</b>: Leo reassures viewers that acknowledging the presence of bullshit is the starting point for pursuing truth, goodness, and personal development, rather than a resignation to a hopeless state.
</li><li><b>Aggressive Ignorance</b>: Leo describes aggressive ignorance as a definitive denial of truth, where individuals boldly assert their ignorance with unwavering confidence and defend it aggressively.
</li><li><b>Collective Drowning in Bullshit</b>: The wide array of societal issues, from war to environmental problems, is attributed to mankind collectively drowning in its own bullshit, per Leo's assessment.
</li><li><b>Inverse Relationship Between Bullshit and Quality of Life</b>: Leo proposes that the quality of life and happiness of an individual is inversely proportional to how much bullshit they harbor, and improving life quality requires addressing one's own bullshit.
</li><li><b>Animals as Non–Bullshitters</b>: Highlighting animals and plants, Leo observes that they thrive without bullshitting and suggests that humans might learn from these beings to reduce their own levels of self–deception.
</li><li><b>Vigilance Against Personal Bullshit</b>: Leo encourages individuals to thoroughly investigate how they are full of shit in various facets of life, including family, relationships, work, sex, food, politics, and more. He stresses these habits are deeply ingrained from an early age and serve survival purposes.
</li><li><b>Challenge in Unwiring Bullshitting Habits</b>: Leo reveals that changing our deeply ingrained habits of bullshitting is difficult because they are tied to critical aspects of survival, such as paying bills and maintaining relationships. Letting go of such habits may threaten one's sense of security and stability.
</li><li><b>Questions for Self–Examination</b>: Leo presents introspective questions to contemplate and journal about to become aware of personal bullshitting habits: How am I full of shit in different life categories? How am I a hypocrite? How do I make excuses for my bullshit? Whose bullshit do I complain about to avoid my own? How am I in denial about my own bullshit?
</li><li><b>Long–term Use of Self–Reflection Questions</b>: Leo underscores the value of self–reflection questions for long–term use; they aren't just for a one–time exercise. Realizing one's own bullshit can take years and continuous examination.
</li><li><b>Relationship Between Bullshitting and Survival</b>: He explains that the more bullshitting aids survival, the more one will deny it and view it as the truth, making it hard to change.
</li><li><b>The Role of Denial and Suppression in Maintaining the Status Quo</b>: Leo highlights that to maintain the current state of affairs, society systematically denies and suppresses "anti–bullshit," which aims to call out and shine a light on the systemic untruths that permeate our culture and institutions.
</li><li><b>Devil's Advocate Against Truth</b>: When confronted with profound truths, people may react with aggressive ignorance to convince themselves, rather than others, that such truths are not valid.
</li><li><b>Natural Human Defense Mechanisms Against Deep Insights</b>: According to Leo, when people encounter deep insights that challenge their beliefs, they tend to either accept them as profound truths or aggressively reject and deny them as a self–defense mechanism.
</li><li><b>Debating as a Means of Self–Confirmation</b>: Leo suggests that when people debate, they are often not trying to convince the other person but rather to reinforce and convince themselves of their own beliefs to avoid facing their own bullshit.
</li><li><b>Need for Personal Direct Experience and Independent Contemplation</b>: He emphasizes the importance of direct personal experience and independent contemplation, along with diverse research and personal investigation, to discern the most critical aspects of life and reality.
</li><li><b>Personal Investigation as Antidote to Bullshit</b>: Leo explains that without personal, independent investigation into important matters, people are likely to end up believing, and perpetuating what is actually bullshit, which only personal effort and discernment can overcome.
</li><li><b>Question Everything</b>: The over–arching message is for people to question everything they are told, instead of accepting narratives and categories defined by others as reality, to avoid being overtaken by the veils of societal and personal bullshit.
</li><li><b>Prevailing Cultural Narratives</b>: Leo criticizes the tendency of individuals to unquestioningly accept the dominant narratives of their culture, which he sees pervasive across various fields including religion, science, and rationality.
</li><li><b>Myth of Rational Questioning</b>: He exposes what he sees as a false notion that scientifically and rationally minded individuals are the champions of independent thought, labeling this as an additional layer of "meta bullshit."
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Investigation</b>: Emphasizing the core of his message at actualized.org, Leo advocates for self–experimentation and personal investigation as means to sift through societal and personal "bullshit."
</li><li><b>Navigating Life's Maze</b>: Leo stresses that only through questioning and exploring a multitude of diverse perspectives can one navigate the complicated maze of life to separate valuable insights from falsehoods.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to use Actualized.org</b>: He invites viewers to use resources on his website–such as his blog, videos, forum, life purpose course, and book list–to aid in discerning valuable knowledge from misinformation.
</li><li><b>Caution Against Single Perspectives</b>: Leo warns against becoming too invested in any particular viewpoint, like Zen or spiral dynamics, acknowledging that while some perspectives offer significant value, they can also perpetuate "bullshit."
</li><li><b>Diverse Perspectives and Meta Perspective</b>: Leo outlines his method for verifying truth by cross–referencing hundreds of perspectives, suggesting that this approach helps eliminate blind spots and develops a nuanced "meta perspective."
</li><li><b>Critical Thinking Behind the Scenes</b>: He reveals the extent of his skepticism and the process of continuously doubting and cross–referencing his own insights to avoid self–delusion.
</li><li><b>Open–mindedness and Flexibility</b>: Leo encourages a flexible, open–minded approach to understanding life, highlighting the need to embrace contradictions and multiple, sometimes–conflicting, perspectives.
</li><li><b>Maps for Different Purposes</b>: Using the metaphor of different types of maps for different uses, Leo illustrates the importance of employing various perspectives to understand the intricate nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Simple Nuggets of Wisdom</b>: Lastly, he acknowledges the power of simple, memorable maxims like "mankind is full of shit" while cautioning against over–reliance on any singular explanation, promising to explore further diverse perspectives in the future.
