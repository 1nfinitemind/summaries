            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/miracle-awakening' target='_blank'>Miracle Awakening</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Consciousness as the ultimate miracle</b>: Leo experiences a profound awakening where he recognizes consciousness as the ultimate miracle. He reframes our understanding of miracles as phenomena that transcend physics and presents consciousness as the singular infinite entity that composes existence.
</li><li><b>Self–awareness of consciousness</b>: Leo illuminates the self–aware nature of consciousness, defining it as a miraculous property. He emphasizes that consciousness' ability to know itself is both mystical and fundamental.
</li><li><b>Oneness and its properties</b>: Through deeper contemplation, Leo unveils the concept of oneness associated with consciousness. He attributes intelligence, love, self–awareness, and the absence of limitations to oneness, reinforcing the idea that all existence is part of this infinite and eternal oneness.
</li><li><b>Existence as an act of divine love</b>: Leo proposes that recognizing the miracle of existence is tantamount to divine love, as consciousness in its fully self–aware state–God consciousness–embraces the miraculous nature and infinite possibilities of its being.
</li><li><b>Awareness and the recognition of existence as a miracle</b>: He encourages contemplation on the nature of existence and consciousness, arguing for a shift in awareness towards recognizing existence as a perpetual miracle and advocating for an internal exploration of this awareness.
</li><li><b>Rediscovery of existential mystery</b>: Leo suggests reconnecting with the mystery of existence by recalling the naive wonder of early life and contrasting it with learned concepts, urging a contemplative return to that state of profound existential curiosity.
</li><li><b>Imagination and creation by consciousness</b>: Discussing the creative power of consciousness, Leo illustrates how reality is configured by consciousness as it imagines various properties and elements, whether physical or abstract.
</li><li><b>Nature of physical reality as an imaginative construct</b>: He posits that our perception of physical reality is a solidified construct of the mind, a necessary stabilization for functional existence that can shift to reveal different realities under certain states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>The limitations of science in explaining miracles</b>: Leo argues that science, being an instance of existence, is incapable of explaining the fundamental miracle of existence itself, asserting the necessity of direct experiential awakening for such understanding.
</li><li><b>Escaping karma through consciousness</b>: Describing a dive into the Godhead, Leo outlines how recognizing life experiences and genetics as illusions within the mind allows one to release accumulated karma through pure consciousness.
</li><li><b>Purification by infinite consciousness</b>: Entering a state of pure white light, consciousness provides a sense of death and healing, erasing karma and self–imposed limitations, reconnecting with one's selfless true nature.
</li><li><b>Transformation through pure consciousness</b>: He describes extensive immersion in the singularity of consciousness as the key to transforming and purifying one's being, a process requiring consistent and sustained dedication.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a tool for awakening</b>: Leo endorses psychedelics as a potent means to achieve higher consciousness and expedite spiritual journeys that might otherwise require decades of traditional practices.
</li><li><b>Self–reliance in spiritual growth</b>: Achieving higher consciousness, Leo has come to reject external spiritual teachings, advocating for direct personal experience as the foundation of spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Limitations of spiritual teachings</b>: Leo criticizes the spiritual community for creating a false perception that deep awakenings are accessible to all, when in reality, they may be restricted to those with specific neurological or genetic predispositions.
</li><li><b>Role of psychedelics</b>: He underscores the crucial role of psychedelics in making profound states of consciousness accessible to the wider population, a capacity that he deems as largely unrecognized or dismissed by traditional spiritual leaders.
</li><li><b>Professional dishonesty</b>: Leo accuses many in the spiritual industry of professional dishonesty by undervaluing psychedelics and misrepresenting the accessibility of deep spiritual experiences.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics' impact on spiritual industry</b>: Leo posits that widespread access to psychedelics would revolutionize the spiritual landscape by reducing the need for traditional gurus and retreats, empowering individuals through direct experiences.
</li><li><b>Personal stance on miracles</b>: Leo shares his confidence in the potential of "local" miracles, such as healing, through a connection to high states of consciousness, a realm he believes is largely unexplored but holds legitimate possibilities.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for personal validation</b>: He concludes by reaffirming the importance of independent experiential verification over any secondary narratives, promoting personal validation as the true pathway to understanding the miracle of existence.
</li><li><b>Unexplainability of miracles</b>: Leo emphasizes that true miracles, including existence itself, cannot be explained because they transcend the bounds of finite understanding. Miracles are infinite, and attempts to map or define them through science or logic miss the essence of their unbounded nature.
</li><li><b>Creative power of consciousness</b>: He describes a state of consciousness where the division between the self and the environment dissolves, allowing one to "create" reality by imagining various properties and forms. Leo suggests that consciousness can shape imagined realities, like a lemon or complex concepts, demonstrating its infinite creative capacity.
</li><li><b>Reality as an imagined construct</b>: Addressing the perceived stability of physical reality, Leo explains that our consciousness has become fixated on a "crystallized" form of imagining, leading to a consistent experience of reality. However, this fixated state is not inherently rigid and can shift, revealing the malleable and imaginative nature of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Self–awareness leading to karma dissolution</b>: In an awakened state, Leo discovers the possibility of erasing karma by realizing that physical limitations like genetics and memories do not exist in the "Godhead" of pure consciousness. This state is devoid of human concepts, presenting the opportunity to liberate oneself from the accumulated constructs of personal history and identity.
</li><li><b>Imaginary nature of karma</b>: Leo conveys the idea that one's karma, which includes personal history, ailments, and problems, is actually an imaginary construct. By achieving heightened consciousness, he proposes that one can 'dissolve' into a singularity of consciousness, where these constructs do not exist, purging one's karma and past memories in a pool of pure white light of consciousness.
</li><li><b>True self and healing in consciousness</b>: When basking in the eternal singularity of consciousness, a person can experience profound healing by shedding all life's accumulated baggage. In this state, there is a feeling of death and dissolution, but also of purification and connection with one's ultimate truest self–the pure Godhead.
</li><li><b>Purification process and loss of identity</b>: The pure state of consciousness and selflessness, described as Nirvana, allows for complete purification from selfish impulses and all forms of suffering. As the purifying process deepens, there's a loss of personal identity and reality, which is a critical part of transformative healing.
</li><li><b>Transformation through persistent consciousness immersion</b>: Leo emphasizes that real transformation requires prolonged immersion in the pure consciousness state. This is not a short–term process; it involves consistent long–term practice to rewire the mind and body, similar to the dedication seen in advanced yogis and meditators who achieve selfless states over decades.
</li><li><b>Accelerating consciousness with psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can offer a more immediate and consistent path to the profound states of consciousness necessary for deep purification. However, a common misconception is that a few psychedelic experiences are enough; Leo underscores the need for repeated and extended encounters with the transformative white light.
</li><li><b>Self–reliance and rejection of external teachings</b>: Having reached an advanced stage in his spiritual journey, Leo now rejects all external spiritual teachings and intellectual knowledge in favor of direct personal experience. He believes most teachings are inferior to the consciousness he has experienced and encourages others to eventually become their own authority.
</li><li><b>Dependence on middlemen until reaching the source</b>: Although Leo advocates for self–sufficiency in spiritual growth, he acknowledges that until one reaches and stabilizes in the source of ultimate consciousness, external guidance can be necessary. The goal, however, is to eliminate dependence on intermediaries and recognize oneself as the ultimate authority–God.
</li><li><b>Self–sufficiency in spiritual practice</b>: Leo discusses his journey towards self–reliance, eschewing debates and external teachings about non–duality. He expresses dissatisfaction with the teachings, books, and videos available, finding them inferior to his direct experiences of consciousness. This realization leads to a sense of relief and empowerment, as he regains authority in his spirituality, an authority he views as inherently belonging to every individual's own consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Inefficacy of traditional spiritual paths for most</b>: Leo contends that genetic, karmic, and brain chemistry differences create disparities in individuals' capacity to access profound states of consciousness through traditional spiritual practices like meditation. He suggests that teachers in the spiritual community unknowingly perpetuate a “scam,” as their extraordinary abilities are atypical and beyond the reach of their students due to these inherent differences.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as transformative agents</b>: The limitations of traditional methods lead Leo to advocate for psychedelics as potent tools for spiritual transformation. He suggests that they can drastically reduce the duration and effort required for one's spiritual journey. Psychedelics are portrayed as drastically underutilized and stigmatized despite their effectiveness, leading Leo to criticize the spiritual community for dismissing their potential. 
</li><li><b>Systemic resistance to psychedelic liberation</b>: Leo asserts that psychedelics threaten not only spiritual hierarchies and business models but also broader societal structures such as capitalism, legal systems, education, marketing, and religion. This, he believes, is the reason behind the stigma and legal restrictions against psychedelics since they have the potential to democratize access to profound states of consciousness and undermine established power dynamics.
</li><li><b>Potential for local miracles through heightened consciousness</b>: While maintaining a critical view on historical accounts of spiritual figures performing miracles, Leo suggests that achieving a high state of consciousness might enable such feats, albeit rarely. He speculates on the future possibility of mastering one's consciousness to a degree that allows for miraculous actions like healing or telepathy.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for individual validation and experience</b>: Leo concludes by insisting on the importance of personal experience and validation over taking his word or any spiritual teachings at face value. He sees his role as offering pointers to help others directly become conscious of the miracles of life, existence, and unity with God, emphasizing the significance of individual exploration and dedication to spiritual growth.
