        <ul>
<li><strong>Strong Determination Sitting technique</strong> : Leo describes Strong Determination Sitting as an intense meditation practice where you sit motionless for a long time (1-2 hours or more), learned from Zen master Shinzen Young. The practice involves surpassing physical discomfort and mental challenges and is a potential fast-track to Enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Zen tradition and physical endurance</strong> : Leo shares stories of the Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei in Japan, who practice extreme physical and mental activities, such as 100-day cycles of long-distance walking in meditation, demonstrating incredible human endurance and potential for consciousness expansion. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Strong Determination Sitting</strong> : Leo expresses that the technique helps one confront the weakness of the mind in Western societies. By enduring the practice, a meditator can experience heightened concentration, calmness, and transcendence, uncovering flaws in one's happiness and understanding of happiness in Western culture. </li>
<li><strong>Extent of personal meditation practice</strong> : After 2.5 years of meditating for an hour every day, Leo managed to achieve a 90-minute Strong Determination Sit, highlighting the difficulty and transformative power of the practice for those who persevere through physical pains and mental distractions. </li>
<li><strong>Conflation of happiness with presence</strong> : Leo critiques the Western perception of happiness, asserting that true happiness is not found in entertainment, stimulation, or love, but in complete presence and unity with the moment and reality, an experience that Strong Determination Sitting can offer. </li>
<li><strong>Significance of happiness and its pursuit</strong> : He challenges the effectiveness of commonly pursued happiness strategies, suggesting that the inability to be still and happy for even one hour reveals a fundamental flaw and misunderstanding of what true happiness entails. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception about monk practices and happiness</strong> : Leo argues that the intense meditation practiced by monks, which appears as self-torture, is fundamentally about training to be happy and non-resistant in the present moment, regardless of circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Essence of meditation</strong> : According to Leo, the ultimate goal of meditation is to 'merge with reality,' suggesting that this union with the present moment enables profound happiness or bliss beyond ordinary experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Western worldview challenge</strong> : Leo invites the audience to juxtapose the happiness achieved through monastic practices with Western pursuits of happiness, questioning the effectiveness of typical Western strategies for achieving true contentment. </li>
<li><strong>Self-assessment of happiness</strong> : He challenges viewers to test their ability to sit peacefully for an hour as an indicator of their psychological state and questions the effectiveness of their current life strategies in achieving happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Rotten psyche and pursuit of happiness</strong> : Leo critiques the modern pursuit of happiness as faulty if it does not lead to peace and happiness in simplicity, suggesting that discomfort with being present indicates a 'rotten' mind or psyche. </li>
<li><strong>Litmus test for Enlightenment</strong> : He proposes that the ability to sit at ease and happily for extended periods without distraction can serve as a practical, albeit not conclusive, test for one's level of Enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation with reality and psychological resistance</strong> : Leo describes the process of sitting still and facing discomfort as a method to align the mind with the ever-changing present moment, countering the human tendency to resist change. </li>
<li><strong>Concept of mind purification</strong> : He shares Shinzen Young's formula that purification equals pain multiplied by mindfulness, which serves to purge the subconscious mind of resistance to the present. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation compared to psychotherapy</strong> : Meditation is likened to psychotherapy but performed on a subtler, moment-to-moment basis, purging the mind of past traumas and embracing the present. </li>
<li><strong>Appreciation of spiritual disciplines</strong> : Leo calls for a reevaluation of Eastern spiritual disciplines, asserting that they are effective psychological tools that can substantially purify the mind and improve well-being. </li>
<li><strong>Pain, Resistance, and Suffering</strong> : Leo explains that suffering is the result of pain times resistance; reducing resistance to zero can, surprisingly, eliminate pain itself, transforming suffering into pleasure and happiness. </li>
<li><strong>Illustration of Resistance Concept</strong> : Leo shares an anecdote from Peter Ralston, an enlightened individual, who had a root canal without anesthesia, smiling through the procedure by completely embracing the pain through mindfulness, thus eliminating suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Degrees and Measures of Enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment is defined by Leo as full presence in the moment without self or resistance, and he clarifies that there are varying levels of enlightenment, which can be profoundly deepened through dedicated practice. </li>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Pain, Suffering, and Spiritual Work</strong> : Leo considers the transformation of one's relationship with pain and suffering as a crucial aspect of spiritual work because constant resistance and fear lead to a life of avoidance and anxiety. </li>
<li><strong>Technique of Strong Determination Sitting</strong> : Leo introduces Strong Determination Sitting as an intense practice where you sit through physical discomfort without movement, leading to breakthrough moments where suffering suddenly vanishes due to the cessation of egoic resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Raising the Bar with Meditation</strong> : Leo suggests that intensive meditation practices, like Strong Determination Sitting, can reveal how low we set the bar for ourselves and greatly improve the quality of life by embracing and transforming discomfort. </li>
<li><strong>Intensive Meditation Recommendation</strong> : As a way to escalate meditation practice and progress towards enlightenment, Leo proposes doing four one-hour sits per day for a week, which can super-charge one&rsquo;s meditation routine and mindfulness capabilities. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Meditation and True Happiness</strong> : The ultimate goal of these practices, according to Leo, is to achieve a state of happiness in everyday life, not just to prove endurance on a meditation cushion. By controlling and knowing oneself deeply, one can experience true happiness and gain almost magical abilities to shape life. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Actualized.org</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to engage with the resources on Actualized.org, where he aims to provide deep psychological insights and practical knowledge for achieving true happiness, self-awareness, and self-control.</li>
