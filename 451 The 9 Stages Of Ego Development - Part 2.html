            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/G8fIhLDV3L4' target='_blank'>The 9 Stages Of Ego Development - Part 2</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Overview of "The 9 Stages Of Ego Development - Part 2"</strong> : Leo continues his series on ego development with part two, focusing on post-conventional stages with a promise of a third installment to delve deeper into the later stages, highlighting that these offer substantial transformative value. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/X764fsTw/451-The-9-Stages-Of-Ego-Development-Part-2-Image-1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature of Scientific Models</strong> : Leo reminds his audience that scientific models, including ego development, have limitations and should not be overextended to non-applicable domains such as animal behavior or film characters. </li>
<li><strong>Capabilities of Earlier Stages</strong> : Leo clarifies that each higher stage retains the capabilities of earlier stages, akin to academic grade progression. He emphasizes that no stage is inherently good or bad; they are constructive parts of human development. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding of Stages</strong> : Leo points out that higher stages can understand lower ones due to broader perspectives, but lower stages struggle to grasp higher ones due to a lack of foundational development. Defense mechanisms might cause individuals at lower stages to deny the existence of higher stages. </li>
<li><strong>Stages During Stress</strong> : Individuals may regress to earlier stages when threatened or under stress. </li>
<li><strong>Awakenings Across Stages</strong> : Leo discusses how mystical experiences and awakenings can occur at any stage, but warns that interpretations can be limited and distorted by the individual's current level of cognitive development. </li>
<li><strong>Post-Conventional Deconstruction</strong> : Starting with the pluralist stage, the post-conventional phase marks the beginning of deconstructing and questioning previously constructed realities. The mind becomes open to reassessing all beliefs, including those in culture, politics, and even the previously unquestioned areas like science and absolute truths. </li>
<li><strong>Post-Conventional Stage &amp; Relativity</strong>: The post-conventional stage involves a cognitive leap where relativity becomes acknowledged and appreciated, contrasting earlier stages that take things as absolute. Individuals begin to see that meanings are not fixed but are based on one's perspective, leading to heightened self-reflection and a critical examination of previously unquestioned beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Escalating Degrees of Relativistic Thinking</strong> : As one progresses through the post-conventional stages, the degree of relativistic thinking intensifies, becoming more pronounced and radical in later stages. Recognizing the relative nature of meaning becomes a central theme in understanding reality. </li>
<li><strong>Emergence of Post-Rational Thought</strong> : Despite conventional stages relying heavily on logic, post-conventional development marks a transition to post-rational thought, distinguishing it from pre-rational beliefs. This allows for the questioning of not just content but the structure of thinking, leading to an awareness of the illusions and self-deception inherent in different beliefs and perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning of Language and Materialist Assumptions</strong> : Language and its role in shaping thought begin to be questioned during the post-conventional stage. Materialist assumptions start to be doubted, albeit not completely, prompting a search for knowledge and understanding beyond materialism and traditional science. </li>
<li><strong>Flexible Conceptual Boundaries</strong> : The once rigid boundaries of concepts like science and religion become more porous and flexible. Individuals realize that these concepts may evolve and share similarities, challenging the conventional dichotomy between science and pseudoscience or religion. </li>
<li><strong>Comparative Analysis of Belief Systems</strong> : Post-conventional thinkers can step outside their own belief systems to objectively analyze and compare different systems. There's an increased drive to uncover hidden assumptions about one's own beliefs and society at large, a trait largely absent in conventional stages. </li>
<li><strong>Appreciation of Hidden Assumptions</strong> : This stage brings an increased interest in existential, metaphysical, psychological, and epistemic issues, with a focus on uncovering hidden assumptions within one's own framework and society. Such deep reflection generally does not resonate with conventional-minded individuals, or "normies," who prioritize material success over introspection. </li>
<li><strong>Pluralist Stage Realization and Relativity</strong> : The pluralist comes to the realization that reality is observer-dependent, embracing instead the exploration of multiple perspectives that were previously dismissed or unrecognized. This includes an appreciation for cultural exploration and a recognition of the influence of the observer on the observed, similar to principles found in quantum mechanics. </li>
<li><strong>Post-Conventional Struggle with Absolutism and Judgment</strong> : At the post-conventional stage, the struggle lies in reconciling the relativistic view with the need for judgment. The absolute certainty of earlier stages and conventional authorities like religious texts and scientific dogma are questioned, opening up an exploration into alternative ways of knowing and understanding the world. </li>
<li><strong>Pluralist Stage and Practical Decision-Making</strong> : In the pluralist stage, individuals grapple with making concrete decisions amidst an overwhelming array of perspectives. The criteria for sorting views into practical and functional ones are not yet clear, leading to confusion and difficulty in managing daily life. </li>
<li><strong>Subjectivity and Personal Biases</strong> : The realization that observations are inherently filtered through subjective lenses humbles the mind and raises awareness of personal biases. This understanding becomes particularly relevant when evaluating areas such as politics, religion, and science. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Conventional Science</strong> : A post-conventional scientist recognizes that science is influenced by the observer's biases and metaphysical assumptions. This realization sparks debate on the methodologies of science and the subjectivity that influences scientific discovery and interpretation. </li>
<li><strong>Recontextualizing Previous Knowledge</strong> : As perspectives expand, earlier scientific models, like Newton's mechanics, are not disproved but instead built upon and recontextualized in a more comprehensive framework, as exemplified by Einstein's theories. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Conditioning and Global Perspective</strong> : The pluralist stage involves recognizing the extent of cultural conditioning and the limited control one has over personal beliefs and values, primarily due to the increased exposure to global diversity through travel and media. </li>
<li><strong>Travel and Worldview Expansion</strong> : Encountering diverse cultures through travel can lead to an existential and moral crisis as it forces pluralists to compare their ways of life with those in different parts of the world, revealing the vastness of human experience. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity and Validity of Worldviews</strong> : Pluralists treat all worldviews as seemingly equally valid, which can be both beneficial and detrimental. This approach presents challenges in discerning the value and applicability of various perspectives, especially when confronting extreme views like Nazism in comparison to more enlightened worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>Adjudicating between Worldviews</strong> : Pluralists struggle with how to fairly adjudicate between the diversity of worldviews due to the loss of criteria for judgment in a relativistic view, leading to the question of whether there is such a thing as absolute truth or not. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Deception and Cultural Bias</strong> : An awareness of self-deception as a defense mechanism used by the mind to construct reality sets in. This leads to the understanding that the greatest threat to post-conventional stages is not external enemies but the internal biases and unexamined assumptions programmed during upbringing. </li>
<li><strong>Existential Crisis from Realization of Mind's Deceptions</strong> : The realization of the extent to which one's mind can deceive itself and the impact of cultural programming lead to an existential crisis and an ongoing process of understanding that previously held 'absolute truths' are not constants but are based on cultural indoctrination. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of Self-Deception and Cultural Programming</strong> : At post-conventional stages, individuals recognize the depth of self-deception and cultural programming. They understand that their previous views on issues like police brutality are overly simplistic and appreciate the complexity involving systems, cultural views, morality, and politics. </li>
<li><strong>Epistemological Inquiry</strong> : Pluralists start grappling with epistemological questions about the nature of knowledge, questioning the truthfulness of science, logic, religion, and spirituality. They understand the importance of differentiating beliefs from reality itself. </li>
<li><strong>Appreciation for Knowledge Foundations</strong> : The post-conventional stage involves deep contemplation on how we acquire and validate knowledge. The singular importance of these foundational questions becomes apparent at this stage of cognitive development. </li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Social Brainwashing</strong> : Individuals come to accept their susceptibility to societal and cultural brainwashing, acknowledging that even educational material can be a form of indoctrination and self-deception. </li>
<li><strong>Recognition of Environmental and Societal Influence</strong> : There is a heightened awareness of how an individual's worldview is shaped by historic, geographic, economic, cultural, and linguistic factors, leading to questions about one's own belief systems, including previously unquestioned aspects like capitalism. </li>
<li><strong>Language and Thought Construction</strong> : Pluralists realize language's role in structuring thought, allowing them to understand their cognition as heavily influenced by linguistic abilities and the limitations of their native tongue. </li>
<li><strong>Scrutiny of Social Constructs</strong> : Post-conventional thinkers start questioning fundamental societal structures, recognizing constructs like capitalism as artificial and subject to manipulation. </li>
<li><strong>Concern with Content Versus Structure of Thought</strong> : Recognizing the similarity in mental structures of seemingly opposite ideologies, such as capitalism and communism, is a critical insight at this stage, revealing one's own inability to transcend ideological constraints previously unconsciously accepted. </li>
<li><strong>Shift from Material to Inner Fulfillment</strong> : There's a fundamental transition from the pursuit of material achievements to an exploration of inner experiences. Interests in money, sex, or possessions often decline as internal self-reflection becomes more compelling. </li>
<li><strong>Exploration of Subjectivity</strong> : Individuals at the pluralist stage reckon with the subjective nature of their worldview, finding this realization both liberating and disorienting as they attempt to navigate their existence without stable reference points. </li>
<li><strong>Temptation of Regression</strong> : Despite feeling unmoored, the temptation to retreat to familiar conventional systems for a sense of security is a significant challenge for individuals in the post-conventional stages. They strive to avoid regressing and maintain their commitment to exploring new paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Discovery of Truth's Complexity</strong> : One's journey to unravel deeper truths becomes arduous, filled with paradoxes, emotional labor, and confusion. Accepting that much of what constitutes knowledge in science and other fields has been assimilated through belief marks the post-conventional transition. </li>
<li><strong>The trap of needing anchors</strong> : To truly be courageous in the pluralist stage, one must release the desire for stability and embrace a period, possibly spanning years or decades, of uncertainty while exploring different perspectives. This process is confusing and emotionally taxing but also liberating as it broadens the range of possibilities beyond the limitations of conventional thinking. </li>
<li><strong>Watching oneself and questioning actions</strong> : In the pluralist stage, one becomes an observer of their own behavior, questioning why they follow certain norms or perform specific actions. This self-observation can lead to the realization that some actions were performed simply because they were imitating others, and not due to a reasoned personal decision. </li>
<li><strong>Abandonment of purely rational analysis</strong> : Pluralists move away from relying solely on rational analysis and incorporate a more holistic, organismic approach that values feelings, intuitions, and context. This reflects a significant shift from traditional methods that prioritize logic and provable facts. </li>
<li><strong>Realizing the limitations of rationality</strong> : The post-conventional stage understands that rationality has inherent limitations and begins to appreciate intuition as a more powerful tool. The pluralist gains wisdom and insight from consciousness itself, rather than linear logical thinking or the need for formal proof. </li>
<li><strong>Logic as a tool for self-deception</strong> : As pluralists progress, they recognize how the mind can use logic to deceive the self and preserve the ego. They see logic becoming self-aware and psychological, accounting for how the mind can manipulate reasoning for its own benefit. </li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on exploration over goals</strong> : For pluralists, the journey and exploration of various perspectives become more valuable than achieving specific goals. There is an increasing distrust of conventional wisdom and strict rationality as pluralists prefer to experience life and relationships over working solely towards material achievements. </li>
<li><strong>The value of scrutinizing assumptions</strong> : Pluralists enjoy the novel mental freedom that comes with scrutinizing assumptions and seeing values as relative. They face the challenge of making judgments and decisions amidst this newfound understanding of relativity. </li>
<li><strong>Problems as interplay between polarities</strong> : Pluralists see problems not as singular issues that can be eliminated but as an interplay of polarities that must be understood and harmonized. Rather than eliminating opposing perspectives, there's a need for understanding and integration. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox and contradiction as features of reality</strong> : Pluralists embrace and relish in paradox and contradiction as fundamental aspects of reality rather than as flaws. They move towards a more holistic understanding, where not everything needs logical proof to be accepted. </li>
<li><strong>Creative use of imagination and diverse perspectives</strong> : With the exploration of diverse perspectives, pluralists' creativity and imagination skyrocket. They start connecting subtle clues rather than dissecting problems into parts, valuing insight, and breakthroughs achieved through non-traditional means like meditation and self-reflection. </li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding of Non-linear Thinking</strong> : Many people ridicule non-linear, spiritual, or holistic approaches like meditation, yoga, chakras, and intuition because they are accustomed to a linear, analytical way of understanding reality. They fail to recognize these as legitimate ways to interface with reality. </li>
<li><strong>Shift from Doing to Being</strong> : In the pluralist stage, there's a transition from constant activity to focusing on being and feeling. This can seem 'hippie' or 'new age' to conventional thinkers who value tangible, materialistic accomplishments over abstract experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness Becomes More Abstract</strong> : As individuals progress through stages, their capacity for abstract thinking increases. This leads to recognizing spirituality and ephemeral experiences as valid and real, even though they may not be tangibly measurable. </li>
<li><strong>Mind-Body Connection</strong> : Pluralists develop an awareness that emotions are not just mental but are also physically manifested throughout the body. They recognize that many ailments could stem from psychological factors like repressed emotions. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Feeling and Emotions</strong> : The realization that emotions are present in the body and not just the mind leads pluralists to practices that integrate body awareness, such as yoga and mindfulness, which are sometimes dismissed by conventional thinkers. </li>
<li><strong>Exploration of the Self</strong> : Pluralists turn inward, valuing self-exploration and self-expression over adhering to socially approved roles. They seek their own unique gifts and answers to personal questions, distancing themselves from conventional routines. </li>
<li><strong>Moving Beyond Conventional Stereotypes</strong> : While 'hippie' qualities like openness and expressiveness characterize the pluralist stage, it doesn't necessitate a complete adoption of hippie lifestyle choices. Pluralists can maintain conventional responsibilities while holding their expanded worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>Beyond Judging and Embracing Relativity</strong> : Pluralists transcend conventional judgments and the demonization of negative social elements. They understand the validity of all perspectives, including those of societal outcasts, and adopt a more nuanced moral outlook. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of Sub-identities</strong> : Pluralists face the challenge of integrating various sub-identities, such as masculine, feminine, rational, and intuitive, into a cohesive whole without denying any aspects. </li>
<li><strong>Fear of Regression and Isolation</strong> : The fear of being pulled back into lower developmental stages is prominent among pluralists. They also risk feeling socially isolated and having relationship conflicts, especially with partners who do not share or understand their post-conventional mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Pitfalls of the Pluralist Stage</strong> : Leo highlights misconceptions at the pluralist stage where all hierarchies are often seen as oppressive, and all opinions as equally valid, which isn't practical for survival. He also points out the issues with extreme relativism leading to indecision, and how too much focus on diversity and equality can be counterproductive, a problem he feels is overstated by conservative critics. </li>
<li><strong>Pluralist Self-Judgment and Toleration</strong> : Pluralists may judge others who don't share their egalitarian views, showing a contradiction in their non-judgmental ideals. Although they tolerate diverse ideas and cultures, they might not always recognize their higher development stage leading to perceived arrogance or naivety. </li>
<li><strong>Contradicting Ideas and Pluralists' Role in Society</strong> : Those in the pluralist stage can entertain contradictory ideas and their attitude often reflects a non-commital stance of "it all depends," leading to indecisiveness. They are more introspective, focusing on internal growth rather than material achievements, often resulting in a fringe existence in society. </li>
<li><strong>Introduction to the Autonomous Strategist Stage</strong> : Leo introduces the strategist stage, accounting for approximately 5% of the U.S. adult population, characterized by systemic understanding, appreciation of all developmental stages, and a global inclusive worldview; which contrasts sharply with the judgmental nature of pluralism. </li>
<li><strong>Strategists' Comprehensive Understanding</strong> : Strategists perceive complex long-term patterns and consider personal and societal development through an evolutionary lens, embracing interconnected systems and responsibilities. </li>
<li><strong>Autonomy and Self-Actualization in Strategists</strong> : Strategists create meaning autonomously, propose new ideas, and take responsibility for their interpretations, striving for meaningful self-actualization and leading by example. </li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and Compassion of a Strategist</strong> : A strategist owns their interpretations and meanings of reality, taking utmost responsibility, which underscores their maturity and rare capabilities to lead and aid humanity's evolution. </li>
<li><strong>The Evolutionary Mission of Strategists</strong> : Strategists view themselves as agents of transformation with a purposeful vision for society's progression. They focus on upholding universal principles despite the inherent challenge of reforming the 'human chimp' to align with high ideals. </li>
<li><strong>Realism of Strategists</strong> : Strategists address patterns, systems, and habits with a practical outlook, understanding the evolutionary steps necessary for change, distinguishing them from the often unrealistic pluralist stage. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Development in Strategists</strong> : Recognizing their own imperfections, strategists continually work on improving themselves as a prerequisite for leading others towards ambitious societal visions, undergoing extensive internal work. </li>
<li><strong>Strategist Embodiment vs. Pluralist Idealism</strong> : Strategists move from the idealism and theoretical concepts of pluralists to a grounded, realistic approach to personal and societal transformation, ensuring they first embody their teachings before implementing them. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Awareness and Growth</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of becoming aware of one's own biases and shortcomings, realizing that addressing and changing these aspects is a challenging process. He acknowledges that while superficial concerns may plague the conventional mind, the strategist is preoccupied with deeper existential questions and a desire to contribute to humanity's betterment. </li>
<li><strong>The Dual Awareness of a Strategist</strong> : Leo explains that strategists are keenly aware of their personal limitations and the extensive needs of humanity. They recognize the progress they've made through inner work and self-actualization while staying committed to guiding others on a similar path. The complexity of maturation and the high value of helping others evolve are underscored. </li>
<li><strong>The Holistic Approach of a Strategist in Business</strong> : Strategists consider not just financial profits but also the well-being of employees, aesthetic environments, and ecological impacts. Leo shares his personal guiding principles behind Actualized.org, prioritizing development and understanding over maximizing profits. </li>
<li><strong>Strategist's Attachment to Transformation</strong> : Leo admits to an initial aggressive approach to transformation at the beginning of Actualized.org, and his gradual learning to allow people their own space and time for growth. He emphasizes a more detached approach now, understanding not everyone is ready for transformation. </li>
<li><strong>Systems Thinking and Evolutionary Development</strong> : Leo talks about how strategists understand and apply systems thinking, recognizing circular causality and the cyclical nature of systems. They believe in the importance of fostering personal growth while being mindful of the readiness and developmental stage of each individual. </li>
<li><strong>Individual Responsibility and Hierarchy</strong> : Leo clarifies that strategists see each individual as responsible for finding and actualizing their unique style. He also distinguishes between healthy, necessary hierarchies and oppressive ones, challenging the idea that all hierarchies are inherently bad. </li>
<li><strong>Life as a Journey of Never-ending Growth</strong> : For strategists, life is about continuous growth and self-actualization. They take on the responsibility for self-regulation and see the pursuit of deep life purposes as essential for a meaningful existence. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Superiority for Strategists</strong> : Leo acknowledges that strategists can give off a sense of superiority due to their deep understanding of human nature, which creates the risk of self-inflation and arrogance. Despite this awareness, he admits to a personal struggle with arrogance but also uses over-the-top arrogance for self-entertainment. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of Emotions and Continuous Improvement</strong> : In contrast to previous stages, strategists accept complex personalities with both positive and negative traits, integrating negative emotions healthily. They acknowledge that perfection is unattainable, but continuous improvement and self-actualization remain the focus. </li>
<li><strong>Identification as a Transformer</strong> : Strategists must be cautious not to let the concept of being a self-actualizer become a new egoic identity, which could hinder authentic development. </li>
<li><strong>Impatience with Others' Growth</strong> : It's common for strategists to feel impatient with the slower developmental progress of others, reflecting an area of personal growth for the strategist themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Possessive Love and Increased Compassion</strong> : The strategist stage is characterized by an understanding and practice of non-possessive love, alongside a growth in benevolence and compassion for oneself and others. </li>
<li><strong>Nuanced Emotional Awareness</strong> : Strategists develop a nuanced understanding of their emotions, learning to distinguish and decode the messages within their emotional spectrum rather than reacting impulsively. </li>
<li><strong>Authenticity in All Aspects</strong> : The strategist strives for authenticity in every aspect of life, including communication, relationships, business, and creative pursuits. </li>
<li><strong>Expanded Tools for Exploring Reality</strong> : Dreams, imagination, fantasy, and vision become significant tools for strategists to explore reality and themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Solutions and Large-scale Thinking</strong> : Strategists search for sustainable solutions to large-scale issues that affect humanity, thinking generationally and aiming to address the root causes of problems. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Blaming in Relationships</strong> : A significant change at this stage is the cessation of blaming others in relationships, indicating a move towards personal responsibility and mature conflict resolution. </li>
<li><strong>Concern for Future Generations</strong> : Strategists invest in the well-being of future generations, often making personal sacrifices for the greater good. </li>
<li><strong>Struggle with Acceptance and Enlightenment</strong> : Despite their advanced stage, strategists still contend with accepting reality as it is and may struggle with difficult emotions. Enlightenment becomes their spiritual goal. </li>
<li><strong>Charismatic Leadership and Vision</strong> : Strategists often emerge as charismatic leaders with a compelling vision for an ideal future world order, inspiring others to contribute towards this vision. </li>
<li><strong>Forgiveness and Redefined Humor</strong> : They learn to forgive themselves and others, leading to decreased guilt and self-criticism. Their humor shifts to a non-hostile, existential reflection on the human condition. </li>
<li><strong>Satisfaction Tied to Self-Actualization</strong> : Strategists feel dissatisfaction if they perceive themselves as falling short of their unique human potential, which can lead to frustration or depression. </li>
<li><strong>Issue of Purpose Post-Career</strong> : Upon retiring or no longer being in a mentorship role, strategists may face existential issues concerning their sense of purpose and relevance. </li>
<li><strong>Realistic Appraisal Skill</strong> : Gaining an understanding of bias allows for clear, more accurate appraisals of situations devoid of personal biases or egoic distortions. </li>
<li><strong>Visionary Systemic Analysis</strong> : Strategists become capable of long-term systemic thinking, understanding the interconnectivity and long-term implications of systems. </li>
<li><strong>Sophisticated Psychological Language</strong> : In discussing human behavior and societal issues, strategists utilize a detailed and sophisticated psychological vocabulary. </li>
<li><strong>Addressing Societal Ambitions and Anxiety</strong> : The strategist faces anxiety about fulfilling one's personal potential and principles while confronting societal pressures and ambitious visions. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Continuous Self-Actualization</strong> : Embracing that self-actualization is an endless journey becomes a critical recognition at the strategist stage.</li>
