            <ul>
<li><strong>Subconscious Behavior in Simple Actions</strong> : Leo experienced a moment of clarity while cooking with his girlfriend when a piece of mushroom fell to the floor and he instinctively added it back into the pan. This action led to a realization about his subconscious issues around scarcity. </li>
<li><strong>Reprogramming Scarce Mentality</strong> : Recognizing the habit born of scarcity, Leo has imposed a new rule against using dropped food, not due to hygiene concerns but as an attempt to shift his scarcity mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Childhood Experiences on Finances</strong> : Leo's childhood environment, where money was a source of conflict, instilled in him a deep sense of financial insecurity, which persists despite his current financial stability. </li>
<li><strong>Conservative Financial Behavior and Its Drawbacks</strong> : He realizes that being overly conservative with money may prevent him from making sound investments or pouring necessary funds into his business, which in turn could hinder his pursuit of life purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Association of Security with Risk-Taking</strong> : Leo discusses the psychological concept that children (and adults) are more likely to take risks when they feel secure. He relates this to his own life, proposing that financial security is crucial for venturing out and pursuing life-changing opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Hang-Ups Limiting Life Progress</strong> : He identifies various areas where personal hang-ups, often rooted in childhood, can limit progress and emphasizes the importance of addressing these obstacles to grow in life. </li>
<li><strong>Availability of Tools for Personal Development</strong> : Leo reassures his audience that no matter the severity of their issues, there are ample tools and resources available to overcome them â€“ including those on his website, actualized.org. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement with the Community</strong> : He encourages viewers to interact with comments, likes, and shares to provide feedback and help disseminate his message, emphasizing the communal aspect of personal growth.</li>
