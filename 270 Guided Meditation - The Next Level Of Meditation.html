            <ul>
    <li><b>Guided Meditation Walk–through</b>: Leo conducts a live exercise guiding viewers through a meditation session, encouraging actual practice over theoretical learning.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Action</b>: Leo stresses the importance of immediate participation in the meditation exercise and warns against dismissing practical steps in favor of solely absorbing theory.
</li><li><b>Surrender as a Key Component</b>: He introduces surrender and letting go as critical elements for a successful meditation practice, contrary to focusing on thought control.
</li><li><b>Comfortable Seating and Stillness</b>: Participants are guided to find a comfortable seated position, close their eyes, and bring their awareness to bodily sensations without trying to meditate or achieve anything.
</li><li><b>Non–Manipulative Approach</b>: Leo highlights that true meditation is not about manipulating thoughts or striving for a peaceful state but about letting go and being aware without effort.
</li><li><b>Merging with Reality</b>: Through the guidance, one learns to gently expand their consciousness beyond their body and merge with their environment, becoming all–encompassing without any conscious effort.
</li><li><b>Restful Mind, Absorption, and Alertness</b>: Meditation is portrayed as a resting of the mind that does not require understanding or enlightenment; one's sense of self becomes absorbed into the surroundings while maintaining alertness.
</li><li><b>Letting Go Continuously</b>: He suggests continuously letting go of control, resistance, and even the desire to release something, thus settling into a state of deep peace.
</li><li><b>Encouraging Regular Practice</b>: Leo recommends daily meditation practice of 20–60 minutes for optimal results, to explore the state of unity with reality.
</li><li><b>Audio Guide for Regular Use</b>: For those who need support, an audio guide is offered to use as a daily meditation tool, focusing on the experiential aspect rather than theory.
</li><li><b>Engagement with Actualized.org Content</b>: Viewers are encouraged to sign up for the Actualized.org newsletter to stay engaged with future materials and practice consistency to achieve profound life changes.
</li><li><b>Transformative Power of Practice</b>: Leo underlines that transformation comes through practice, not theory, and consistent practice is essential to grasp advanced concepts.
