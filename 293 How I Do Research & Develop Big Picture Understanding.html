            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/TVPzXaHMifw' target='_blank'>How I Do Research & Develop Big Picture Understanding</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Epistemic Foundation</b>: Leo attributes his ability to research and develop a big picture understanding of life to having the right epistemic foundation. He views this not as a technique but as a fundamental approach to inquiry, emphasizing that without this foundation, people fail to develop accurate big pictures of reality.
</li><li><b>Initial Interest in Philosophy & Epistemology</b>: Leo traces his journey back to his interests in philosophy and epistemology during high school and college, where he became deeply engrossed in questions about knowledge and truth.
</li><li><b>Meta–Philosophy and Role of Psychology</b>: While engaging in philosophy, Leo observed his own process and the influence of personal psychology, such as biases and desires, on philosophy and the pursuit of truth.
</li><li><b>Limits of Philosophy and Reason</b>: He realized that philosophy has its limitations, and it cannot be used to solve every problem. Recognizing these limits is crucial to preventing missteps in philosophical inquiry.
</li><li><b>Leo's Research Process</b>: Over a decade of research has been guided by Leo's developing epistemic foundation, which he considers his "superpower" in growing quickly and discovering new areas of knowledge.
</li><li><b>Starting Position of Inquiry</b>: Leo insists that the starting point of inquiry is admitting "we don't know what's true," which he feels is often overlooked as individuals bring assumptions into their research.
</li><li><b>Openness to Every Possibility</b>: He underscores the significance of being open to every possibility since we cannot prejudge the outcome of research nor know which guiding principles to apply.
</li><li><b>Independence from Pre–mined Knowledge</b>: Leo stresses the importance of not relying solely on information supplied by others in books or by experts, as it is crucial to critically evaluate these sources independently.
</li><li><b>Self–Deception as Main Enemy</b>: Self–awareness is key, with Leo pointing out that personal biases and weaknesses are the main obstacles in research, not the misconceptions of others.
</li><li><b>Every Perspective Has Hidden Assumptions</b>: He acknowledges that all perspectives have underlying, often unexamined assumptions, which shape one's worldview and are foundational to understanding.
</li><li><b>Partiality of All Perspectives</b>: Leo claims that adopting any single perspective will yield an incomplete understanding, so it is essential to study multiple perspectives to obtain a broader comprehension of reality.
</li><li><b>Partial Perspective Problem</b>: Leo stresses that every perspective is incomplete and suggests sampling a variety of perspectives without fully committing to any single one, similar to exploring various dishes at a buffet.
</li><li><b>Models vs. Reality</b>: He warns that while models can be helpful, they should never be mistaken for reality. Good models can falsely reassure us that we have reality figured out; this misplaced confidence is a significant epistemic risk.
</li><li><b>The Web of Beliefs</b>: Leo describes our belief system as a loosely fact–connected web, allowing for varying interpretations of the same facts. He points out that different people might build different belief systems to explain identical phenomena, leading to diverse perspectives and ideologies.
</li><li><b>Rejecting Foundationalism</b>: Leo declares the philosophical attempt to find an indisputable base for all beliefs, foundationalism, to be a historical failure. He asserts there is no single truth that can serve as the fundamental cornerstone for understanding reality.
</li><li><b>Limited Use of Rationality</b>: He argues that relying solely on rationality to understand reality is a mistake because rationality is only a subset of reality, and much of the universe contains no rationality.
</li><li><b>Embracing Paradox</b>: Leo suggests that paradox, rather than being a sign of failure, indicates the depth of the quest to understand reality or could signify the limitations of our attempts to rationalize everything.
</li><li><b>Primacy of Direct Experience</b>: He concludes that direct experience should be the primary source of information in research, as it is less fraught with pitfalls than authority or reasoning, though all can play a role.
</li><li><b>Spectrum of Direct Experiences</b>: Leo underlines the importance of expanding the spectrum of direct experiences to develop a bigger picture understanding of reality, since having a narrow range can distort one's perception of the whole.
</li><li><b>Practicality in Philosophy</b>: He emphasizes the need to ensure that philosophical exploration is grounded in practicality, with the goal of improving life quality, emotional mastery, and achieving personal success.
</li><li><b>Positionless Inquiry</b>: Leo advocates for an approach to understanding that is free from defending any fixed standpoint, focusing on exploration and understanding rather than on supporting a particular ideology.
</li><li><b>Understanding Over Truth</b>: He argues for prioritizing the pursuit of understanding different life aspects instead of chasing a fixed "truth," which can be a limiting and rigid quest.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Diverse Life Aspects</b>: Leo states the need to explore a broad spectrum of life experiences, including engaging with intelligent people, encountering altered states, and investigating unconventional phenomena to enrich the understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Maintaining a No–Position Stance</b>: He advises maintaining a stance with no firm positions to defend, focusing only on understanding and how to optimally live life.
</li><li><b>Shift from Possession to Understanding</b>: Leo emphasizes the shift from trying to possess the ultimate truth to fostering a broader understanding. He isn't interested in claiming a singular "best" way to do things, but rather in comprehending the variety, mechanics, and nuances in various fields such as business, personal development, spiritual development, relationships, and health.
</li><li><b>Holism vs. Hyper–Specialization</b>: Leo criticizes the hyper–specialization seen in academia that focuses on minute, often irrelevant details. He advocates for a holistic approach to life, prioritizing comprehensive understanding that impacts one's happiness, relationships, emotional mastery, and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Argumentation as an Ego Trap</b>: Leo points out that engaging in argumentation, debate, and justification are ego–driven activities that obstruct the quest for truth. Defending a position creates attachment and stagnation, whereas the goal should be the continued expansion of one's understanding.
</li><li><b>Principles for Investigation</b>: Leo shares the principles he's learned without delving into how he acquired them. He suggests using them as axioms to guide one's investigation and to remain skeptical, even of the information he provides, acknowledging that understanding starts from accepting one knows nothing for sure.
</li><li><b>Default Position as Major Obstacle</b>: Detailing the "default position," Leo describes it as going with the flow, which leads to limited understanding and persistent struggles in various life aspects. It stems from uncritically absorbing mainstream beliefs and not questioning deeply about life.
</li><li><b>Academic Approach Limitations</b>: Leo describes the academic approach's pitfalls as narrowly focused and specialized, often lacking practical use in one's life. This can lead to knowledge depth in one area but a lack of understanding in others, failing to create a holistic view of life.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Adhering to a Single Spiritual Tradition</b>: Leo warns against dogmatically following a single spiritual tradition, which might offer enlightenment but also presents a narrow, culturally biased perspective. This partial view can hinder developing the most extensive understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Relying Solely on Direct Experience</b>: Leo stresses that exclusive reliance on direct experience, without external input, can lead to severe self–deception. He underscores the importance of being critical of one's understanding, even when derived from direct experience.
</li><li><b>Motivation and Self–Reliance in Research</b>: Leo warns against over–reliance on oneself for discovering reality without considering other perspectives. Focusing solely on oneself can lead to a limited understanding due to a narrow spectrum of experiences and ignoring the lessons available from various traditions, scientific disciplines, and historical mistakes.
</li><li><b>Limits of Single Method Approaches</b>: Leo critiques various single method approaches for understanding reality, such as exclusively focusing on academic study or direct experience. He suggests that any singular approach is inherently flawed and can lead to "epistemic traps."
</li><li><b>Leo's Pragmatic Approach to Understanding</b>: He advocates for a pragmatic approach that involves a committed dedication to understanding without being defensive about one's position. Leo outlines a process that includes being mindful of debates, avoiding semantic squabbles, studying a wide range of perspectives, and integrating those with direct experience to continuously refine one's model of reality.
</li><li><b>Cross–Referencing Perspectives</b>: Leo proposes a method of learning by experiencing different perspectives, such as studying with masters of various religious and philosophical doctrines. By doing so, he aims to triangulate common elements and validate them against personal intuition, to create a coherent bigger picture.
</li><li><b>Flexibility in Understanding</b>: Recognizing the provisional nature of knowledge, Leo stresses the importance of adaptability and willingness to discard outdated beliefs. He suggests that as understanding grows, what once seemed true may later be recognized as flawed.
</li><li><b>Openness to Being Wrong</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of being open to the possibility that one's entire understanding could be fundamentally flawed. This requires a high degree of humility and the courage to abandon misconceptions.
</li><li><b>Positive Outlook on the Pursuit of Understanding</b>: Despite the reality that understanding can be complex and riddled with potential for error, Leo maintains a positive outlook – believing that the pursuit of understanding is inherently valuable and will yield practical benefits in time.
</li><li><b>Rejection of the Default Position</b>: Leo criticizes the default position of abstaining from active research and passively absorbing mainstream ideas, stressing that such inaction leads to ignorance and aligns with the majority's status quo.
</li><li><b>Risk of Loyalism to Single Teachings</b>: He warns against becoming overly loyal to any one spiritual or philosophical tradition, as it can prevent a broader, more comprehensive understanding of reality and lead to sectarianism.
</li><li><b>Reality's Potential for Absurdity and Counterintuitiveness</b>: Leo argues for staying open to the possibility that reality may be fundamentally different from what we expect – it can be irrational, shocking, and contain twists that challenge our most ingrained assumptions.
</li><li><b>Openness to the Absurd</b>: Leo Gura stresses being open to absurd, illogical, and paradoxical ideas during research, as dismissing them prematurely can be a significant barrier to discovering deeper truths.
</li><li><b>Long–Term Approach to Research</b>: Gura advocates for a long–term commitment to research, suggesting that the benefits of such investigation may not be immediately apparent but can lead to profound, lasting success later in life.
</li><li><b>Not Obsessing Over Immediate Utility</b>: He cautions against overly focusing on the immediate practical utility of research, emphasizing that transformation in life's foundation might take years to manifest but will result in remarkable improvements.
</li><li><b>Deep, Stable Success</b>: By nurturing and cultivating one's foundational understanding, Leo suggests that one achieves a resilient form of success that is immune to external instability, such as economic downturns or job loss.
</li><li><b>Pursuing Wisdom Over Resources</b>: The approach highlighted by Gura prioritizes wisdom and personal growth over acquiring material resources like money, leading to more substantive and enduring life satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Meta Sources in Research</b>: Gura underlines the use of meta sources–those who have synthesized multiple perspectives–to gain a holistic big picture, which he considers an effective approach to understanding reality deeply.
</li><li><b>Reality as Ever–Evolving</b>: He acknowledges that the big picture of reality will always be under construction and encourages a constant state of adjustment and evolution of one's understanding until the end.
</li><li><b>Value of the Meta Research Approach</b>: Leo conveys that while the subtleties of his meta research approach may be hard to articulate to those who have not delved deeply into various perspectives, those who do engage with it will live uniquely satisfying and impactful lives.
</li><li><b>Reconstructing Beliefs</b>: He likens the ongoing modification of beliefs to sailors at sea who must perpetually repair their ship while it's in use, emphasizing continuous effort and vigilance.
</li><li><b>Approach to Objections and Risks</b>: Gura addresses concerns about wasting time investigating 'nonsense' and the risk of adopting silly beliefs, clarifying that an open–ended search inevitably includes dead ends, but the overall process is designed to minimize these risks and is the nature of thorough research.
</li><li><b>Pursuing Extraordinary Outcomes</b>: He invites individuals to consider the long–term value of an unorthodox approach to research, one that few people undertake but potentially yields exceptional results.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Perspective Sampling</b>: Leo clarifies that his research method is not relativism; he does not regard all perspectives as equally true but advises against averaging different perspectives. Instead, some perspectives will be quickly identified as incorrect, while others may hold more truth.
</li><li><b>Transformative Value of Research</b>: Leo speaks to the concern of the research process being a waste of time, suggesting that the subtle accumulative effects over time can lead to significant life transformations, justifying the commitment to the process.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Exclusivity of Enlightenment</b>: Leo challenges the belief that the pursuit of enlightenment alone is sufficient for understanding reality. He points out that even after enlightenment, there may still be unknowns, urging the necessity for openness to more than just enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Cautiousness in Adopting Beliefs</b>: Leo insists on the need for extreme caution in holding beliefs and understanding reality. He stresses the importance of continually being open–minded and questioning, regardless of one's current level of enlightenment or knowledge.
</li><li><b>Self–Vigilance in Research</b>: Leo emphasizes his commitment to epistemic humility and aware self–vigilance. He highlights the need to constantly be on guard against one's own potential for self–deception and to remain flexible and open to reevaluating one's beliefs, regardless of how certain they may seem externally.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org and Continued Research</b>: Leo promotes his website, Actualized.org, and outlines his commitment to ongoing research in personal development. He promises future content that will deliver profound, potentially paradigm–shifting perspectives.
