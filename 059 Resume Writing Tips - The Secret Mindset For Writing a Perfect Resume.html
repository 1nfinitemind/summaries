            <ul>
<li><strong>Understanding the employer's viewpoint</strong> : Leo's experience as both an employee and an employer has revealed that understanding the employer's needs is crucial for effective resume writing. He emphasizes that grasping the employer's perspective can greatly simplify the resume-writing process. </li>
<li><strong>Employer's specific requirements</strong> : Employers look for candidates who can solve particular problems and handle parts of their business efficiently and affordably. They need someone competent and reliable to take advantage of market opportunities or to address challenges swiftly. </li>
<li><strong>Cost-benefit consideration for employers</strong> : The employer must balance the need for qualified talent against the cost of hiring. They seek the most skilled individual at a reasonable price to maintain profitability. </li>
<li><strong>Demonstrating value and skill:</strong> A candidate must convey their value through specific skills and the ability to deliver solutions. Experience in the job's required areas and proficiency in necessary skills are critical for reassuring the employer of the candidate's capability. </li>
<li><strong>Specialization over generalization</strong> : Specialists with direct experience are often preferred over generalists, as they are more likely to efficiently solve specific problems, reducing risk for the employer. </li>
<li><strong>Clarity in resume details</strong> : Resumes should clearly outline what the candidate offers, focusing on specialized skills and experiences relevant to the employer's needs. Eliminating unnecessary jargon and fluff makes it easier for employers to see the candidate's true qualifications. </li>
<li><strong>Personal characteristics matter</strong> : Including personal traits that contribute to success, such as punctuality, sociability, diligence, and reliability, can enhance a candidate's appeal to the employer. </li>
<li><strong>The importance of a strong portfolio</strong> : An impressive portfolio can be the most convincing part of a resume. Demonstrating actual work is often more effective than descriptions of skills and experience. </li>
<li><strong>Conciseness in resume writing</strong> : A concise resume, free of unnecessary details, and focused on the employer's needs, is more effective. It should be structured as a straightforward outline of what the job seeker can provide. </li>
<li><strong>Empathy with the employer's mindset</strong> : By adopting the perspective of the employer, job seekers can independently identify the most effective strategies for presenting their resumes, crafting documents that are more likely to capture the employer's attention.</li>
