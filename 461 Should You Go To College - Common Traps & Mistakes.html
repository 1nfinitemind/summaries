            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yVU2kOlXJ0E' target='_blank'>Should You Go To College - Common Traps & Mistakes</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of the college dilemma</b>: Leo discusses the importance of carefully considering the decision to attend college, stressing the need for individuals to understand themselves and their goals in order to avoid mistakes and confusion during the crucial years between 18 and 25.
</li><li><b>Leo's qualifications on giving college advice</b>: Leo shares his varied career path and academic background, emphasizing his experience with career changes and different fields to underline his credibility in advising on the college decision.
</li><li><b>Societal programming around college</b>: Leo challenges the societal expectation to attend college as the default path, urging young people to critically evaluate their life goals and consider whether college aligns with them.
</li><li><b>The importance of clarity in life</b>: He emphasizes the need for youth to spend significant time alone, reflecting on what they want from life, in order to avoid wasting time and resources stumbling through unclear goals.
</li><li><b>The significance of experience</b>: Leo advises gaining experience through exposure, trial and error, and practical tests while maintaining introspection to learn about personal strengths and desires.
</li><li><b>Understanding oneself for life planning</b>: The process of self–discovery is stressed as an essential foundation for designing a life and career that is in harmony with one's unique talents and personality.
</li><li><b>Traditional college majors and paths</b>: Leo outlines that college is necessary for conventional, certification–requiring careers like engineering or academia but may not be the best path for all individuals, especially those unsure of their direction.
</li><li><b>Consequences of unclear life plans</b>: He warns against the risk of passive decision–making leading to wasted years and dead–ends, highlighting the urgency of proactive life planning during the formative late teen and early adult years.
</li><li><b>Leo's personal college journey</b>: Illustrating with his own story of transitioning from aerospace engineering to philosophy and ultimately different career switches, Leo illustrates the importance of aligning education choices with personal interests and passion rather than blind commitment to unsuitable paths.
</li><li><b>Encouraging active decision making</b>: Leo stresses crafting an active, informed life plan to avoid pitfalls like wage slavery and dissatisfaction, advocating for timely and well–considered choices about education and career.
</li><li><b>Interconnection between College Education and Career</b>: University education serves as a pathway to a career, and Leo further emphasizes it as an avenue to identify and align with one's life purpose, advocating for passion as an essential element for career satisfaction and success.
</li><li><b>The fallacy of externally imposed career choices</b>: Leo warns against choosing a career path based on external pressures, particularly from parents, highlighting the importance of selecting a career that ignites deep personal passion to avoid lifelong dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Passion versus Profit in Career Choice</b>: Leo counters the notion that a high–paying career is sufficient, contending that only a career fueled by passion can sustain one's drive and prevent the loss of potential financial and personal value over an extended period.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose and Self–awareness</b>: Leo points out the lack of guidance in schools, at home, or universities on discovering one's life purpose, urging students to invest time in understanding their personalities and passions to tailor a fulfilling career and life.
</li><li><b>Consequences of lacking a career and financial plan</b>: Leo articulates that without a concrete career and financial plan, graduates may become financially dependent on their parents or resort to unsatisfying low–paying jobs, emphasizing the importance of planning to achieve financial independence.
</li><li><b>Proper Career and Life Purpose Planning</b>: The importance of proactive and early life purpose and career planning is underscored as a means to avoid the trap of wage slavery and to live a life aligned with one's unique strengths and values.
</li><li><b>The Role of Business in Survival</b>: Leo redefines business as the activity of human survival within society, explaining that mastering it is crucial for financial independence and living on one's terms.
</li><li><b>Choosing a University Major</b>: Leo evaluates 'hard majors' with clear job prospects versus 'soft majors' which may not immediately translate to job opportunities. He encourages students with solid career goals, like becoming a psychologist, to pursue university education, while recommending others to have a tangible income plan post–graduation.
</li><li><b>Personal Experience with University Major Selection</b>: Leo shares his experience shifting from aerospace engineering to game design as an example of adjusting one's educational track when realizing one's passion lies elsewhere, highlighting the significance of aligning one's major with genuine interests.
</li><li><b>Critical decision–making in career paths</b>: Leo acknowledges the importance of confronting mistakes in career choices, using his own experience of abandoning aerospace engineering for game design due to passion. Choosing a non–traditional career path, like game design, can pose challenges as it often falls outside university curriculum and may appear risky like childhood fantasies such as becoming an astronaut.
</li><li><b>Switching majors to follow passion</b>: Faced with financial and logistical constraints in pursuing a specialized game design education, Leo formulated a plan to self–teach game design skills while switching his major to philosophy, which he was passionate about. This decision was strategic, reducing his course load and allowing him to focus on building a game design portfolio.
</li><li><b>Breaking into the game industry</b>: Leo's plan succeeded; he graduated early, dedicated time to develop his portfolio, and secured a job at a top game design studio, working on Bioshock Infinite. Despite the initial success and difficulty of entering the game industry as a designer, his dissatisfaction with wage slavery led him to leave.
</li><li><b>Transition to self–employment</b>: Leo's next step was to escape wage slavery by becoming financially independent through self–employment. He learned web development, online marketing, and eventually founded actualized.org, all while gaining certification as a life coach and gaining practical experience in coaching clients.
</li><li><b>The necessity of exploring different paths</b>: Leo emphasizes the vitality of exploring various career options to discover what truly resonates with an individual. Settling too quickly into an ill–fitting job out of inertia leads to underutilized potential, financial issues, and emotional problems.
</li><li><b>Passion and value creation</b>: Understating the importance of passion, Leo argues it's crucial for creating significant value in one's work, which in turn leads to better financial compensation. Passion is not a luxury but fundamental to both personal fulfillment and career success.
</li><li><b>Finding one's purpose</b>: Leo advises being proactive and persistent in the search for life's purpose rather than knowing the exact major or career from the start. Commitment to figuring out one's passion is more critical than immediate certainty.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing job fantasy from reality</b>: There is often a disconnection between one's imagined perception of a job and its reality. Leo recommends engaging in actual activities related to desired jobs to ensure that the reality matches one's expectations and enjoyment.
</li><li><b>Financial cost and debt from college</b>: Leo highlights the major issue of financial costs and debts associated with college, potentially leading to wage slavery if not managed wisely. The escalating costs make the risk of debt a significant consideration in deciding whether to attend college.
</li><li><b>Opportunity cost of college education</b>: The second major problem Leo identifies with college is the opportunity cost involved in spending four years on potentially impractical knowledge. He suggests that time might be better spent learning skills that will be used directly in one's chosen career field.
</li><li><b>Inadequate focus on practical skills in university</b>: According to Leo, the education received at universities is often focused on theory rather than practical skills, which does not align with the real–world skills necessary for most careers. He views the education as indoctrination more than genuinely informative or practical.
</li><li><b>University as Indoctrination</b>: Leo criticizes the university system for indoctrinating students, focusing on memorization and cramming for tests, rather than teaching deep thinking or practical life skills.
</li><li><b>Misalignment with Career Needs</b>: Leo reflects on his own experience, deeming his studies in advanced physics and calculus as a waste for his career in business and programming, highlighting a disconnect between university education and actual job requirements.
</li><li><b>Opportunity Costs of Traditional Majors</b>: Discusses the risk of investing time and money in majors like English, history, or sociology, which may not translate into tangible skills or knowledge needed in the workplace, leading to potential waste of resources.
</li><li><b>Practical Skills for the Business World</b>: Emphasizes the need for tangible, marketable skills that provide value to employers and clients, rather than theoretical knowledge offered by many university courses.
</li><li><b>Academia's Pyramid Scheme</b>: Leo denounces the university system as a pyramid scheme, where only a few reach the top academic positions, while most do not become academics, lacking skills to survive outside of academia.
</li><li><b>Education's Role in Combating Extremism</b>: Asserts that university education can combat social and political problems like nationalism and fascism by teaching source evaluation, intellectual integrity, and steering people away from radical ideologies.
</li><li><b>Limitations to the Academy's Approach</b>: Discusses shortcomings of university education in teaching crucial life skills such as practical business skills, self–help, psychology, and a deep understanding of reality, which Leo believes should be the core of education.
</li><li><b>University System Geared Towards 'Stupid People'</b>: Critiques the education system for its factory farming approach, lacking in consciousness or wisdom, and suggests it provides a standardized mode of understanding fields rather than promoting deep personal education.
</li><li><b>Value of General Education</b>: While critical, Leo acknowledges the rounding effect of general education on an individual's breadth of knowledge, important for creating informed citizens and fostering societal stability.
</li><li><b>Restrictive Academic Structure</b>: Shares personal frustration with inability to pursue deep interests within his university philosophy major due to scheduling conflicts and formal requirements, advocating for self–guided study for deeper understanding.
</li><li><b>Certificates and Degrees as Inadequate Measures of Understanding</b>: Leo challenges the notion that degrees signify deep understanding of a subject, suggesting personal study can lead to a greater depth of knowledge than formal academic credentials.
</li><li><b>Self–Discipline and Independence over University Education</b>: Argues that university may not be necessary for those who are self–motivated and capable of disciplining themselves for self–education, positing that university is better suited to individuals who need structured learning.
</li><li><b>University as a 'Meat Grinder' System</b>: Leo compares the structure of universities to a mechanical institution similar to religion, where individuals follow defined rules without deep thinking. Many prefer institutional systems because they eliminate the need for self–discipline and provide a straightforward path.
</li><li><b>Credentials and Degrees vs. Real–world Value</b>: Leo debunks the notion that academic credentials and degrees inherently offer value. He stresses that the true measure of success is one's ability to creatively solve problems and offer value to society, which is not necessarily correlated with grades or diplomas.
</li><li><b>Real Skills Learned Outside University</b>: He contends that hands–on projects and self–learning outside the university environment often lead to more effective skill development than traditional college education, especially in fields like computer programming.
</li><li><b>Benefits of College</b>: Leo acknowledges the benefits of a university education for those who may not know how to educate themselves and for providing a well–rounded education. He also notes the importance of college for social development and clear career paths in fields like engineering and medicine.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Overemphasis on Career or Social Life</b>: Leo reflects on his personal overemphasis on career development, neglecting socialization during university years, and warns against excessive focus on either aspect to the detriment of the other.
</li><li><b>Advocating for Self–Education Over College</b>: He proposes a serious commitment to self–education over college, emphasizing that self–taught skills based on passion and interest can lead to a faster, more practical, and well–rounded knowledge base.
</li><li><b>Project–Based Learning as Superior Education</b>: Leo shares his success with project–based learning and suggests that personal projects, freelancing, and interacting with real–world challenges offer more substantial learning experiences than formal education.
</li><li><b>Portfolio Over Degrees for Employment</b>: He advises that a well–polished project portfolio can impress potential employers more than a degree, recommending individuals focus on small, well–executed projects that showcase their capabilities.
</li><li><b>Value of Project–Based Learning</b>: Engaging in personal projects provides practical challenges that facilitate learning more effectively than textbook reading or lectures. Overcoming repeated failures in these projects leads to a deep understanding of the subject.
</li><li><b>Potential of Self–Education</b>: The internet offers unparalleled opportunities for self–education, with abundant resources like cheaper books, online courses, and training programs across various subjects, providing valuable skills often at a fraction of the university cost.
</li><li><b>Investment in Self–Education</b>: Financial investments in self–education, such as books and courses, are emphasized as yielding high returns over time and being a wiser financial decision compared to the inflated costs of traditional university materials.
</li><li><b>Importance of Conferences</b>: Attending professional conferences, such as the Game Developers Conference, offers opportunities to network, learn industry insights, and potentially secure jobs, underscoring their importance regardless of the costs involved.
</li><li><b>Modeling for Success</b>: Modeling involves studying and emulating the routines and habits of successful individuals to replicate their achievements. Leo suggests interviewing and dissecting the practices of such individuals to build similar success.
</li><li><b>Warning Against Self–Education Pitfalls</b>: Self–education requires ambition, passion, and strong self–discipline. Leo warns that without self–regulation, one may procrastinate and waste time, suggesting that those who struggle with self–discipline may benefit more from the structured university environment.
</li><li><b>Making Independent Life Decisions</b>: Emphasizing individual responsibility, Leo urges viewers not to outsource vital life decisions, such as choosing a major or career path, to others but to make them based on personal vision and goals.
</li><li><b>Development of Practical Skills</b>: Leo credits his success to skills gained from self–education in areas like web development, psychology, and personal development, many of which are not taught at university but are crucial for a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Convincing Parents</b>: To address parents' worries about non–traditional educational paths, Leo suggests presenting a comprehensive self–education plan, demonstrating the potential for skill development, and financial survival to win their support.
</li><li><b>Approaching adulthood with responsibility</b>: At the age of adulthood, it is important to act with maturity, particularly by standing up for your own passions and values even if they differ from parental expectations.
</li><li><b>Parental concerns about survival</b>: Parents prioritize their children's survival and financial stability, which is why they might urge them towards careers like medicine or law. Addressing their concerns with a practical plan for developing survival skills is key.
</li><li><b>Advocating for self–education</b>: Regardless of choosing to attend university or not, Leo underscores the necessity of self–education, especially in areas not covered by formal education like self–help, meditation, spirituality, and business skills.

</li><li><b>Taking personal growth seriously</b>: It is crucial to take personal development and adult decision–making seriously. Accept that growth is now a personal responsibility rather than expecting it to come from external sources like during early education.
</li><li><b>The ongoing journey of education</b>: Education is a lifelong journey that begins after university ends. Leo encourages utilizing resources like actualized.org for continued learning and personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Four key lessons for the young</b>: Leo offers clarity, tailoring life to personal strengths, commitment to lifelong learning, and proactive engagement as essential lessons for young adults navigating their future.
</li><li><b>Investing in self–education</b>: Leo highlights the difference between formal education and self–directed learning, urging young adults to invest in the latter and not to confuse it with merely attending university.
</li><li><b>The value in creating personal methods</b>: Institutions are designed for the average, not the ambitions of the few. Leo prompts those who want to excel and self–actualize to create their own education methods.
