            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ypSinz7WB3I' target='_blank'>The Paradox Of Developing Self-Trust</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Paradox of Self-Trust</strong> : Leo discusses the paradox of self-trust in personal development, highlighting the tension between needing to question one's beliefs and limitations versus the directive to trust oneself completely. This paradox is particularly challenging for beginners and those at intermediate levels of personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Doubting Limiting Beliefs</strong> : Personal development entails the critical task of doubting one's limiting beliefs, ideologies, and the structures of rationality that constitute one's worldview. However, individuals typically fall into the trap of blindly believing these constructs, which hinders growth. </li>
<li><strong>Misplaced Trust by Newbies</strong> : Leo points out that personal development newbies often mistakenly place their trust in their mind, fears, emotions, and ego. This misplaced trust leads them astray, causing neuroses and dysfunction. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of Faith in the 'Higher Self'</strong> : Conversely, newbies fail to trust their intuition and 'higher self', terms which Leo acknowledges as abstract but important to understand precisely. Trusting these can guide one to better decision-making and personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Trusting the Mind Too Easily</strong> : The problem for beginners lies in trusting their own mind and its deceptive features. He asserts that the mind's self-deceptive qualities can lead to misplaced trust and wrong life decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Trust Issues and Self-Doubt</strong> : Leo links trust issues and skepticism towards others to a deep-seated inability to trust oneself. He emphasizes the need for introspection and self-doubt to address these issues effectively. </li>
<li><strong>Self Biases and the Ego</strong> : Highlighting the need to doubt the ego, Leo draws attention to the pervasive self biases that favor the ego and create double standards in one's behavior and opinions. </li>
<li><strong>Deception of the Immune System</strong> : Analogous to a corrupted immune system, one's belief-filled mind can prevent growth and self-consciousness. He suggests a necessity for vigorous self-inquiry, especially regarding one's deepest and most cherished beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Free from Beliefs Ultimately</strong> : The ultimate goal, Leo implies, is to be free from beliefs and ideologies, not merely categorizing them as good or bad or true or false, but rather assessing whether or not one is enslaved by them. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Rationality and Logic</strong> : He counsels a radical questioning of rationality, logic, and the underlying reasons for one's beliefs, advocating a comprehensive skepticism towards all structures and frameworks of thought. </li>
<li><strong>Justifications for Beliefs</strong> : Every belief is built upon layers of justifications, which are commonly taken for granted. Starting from a surface belief and tracing it back to understand the underlying reasons leads to deeper introspection. This process can reveal a nested hierarchy of justifications that eventually form one's entire belief system. </li>
<li><strong>Doubting Rationality, Logic, and Science</strong> : Accepting rationality, logic, and science without sufficient questioning closes off the mind from experiencing deeper states of consciousness. These frameworks, while useful, are not infallible and should be subjected to skepticism to avoid limiting one's mental and experiential potential. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of External-Focused Skepticism</strong> : Skeptics often make the error of directing their doubt outward rather than inward. A genuine skeptic must also doubt their own skepticism, understanding that undirected skepticism can be a defensive tool of the ego to resist growth and new ideas. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Religious Doctrine</strong> : As with science and rationality, religious beliefs and doctrines should be questioned. These often reinforce superficial understanding and prevent an in-depth exploration of the very concepts that religions aim to elucidate. </li>
<li><strong>Scrutinizing Emotions as Ego Tools</strong> : Emotions, both negative and positive, should be examined for their truthfulness and potential manipulation by the ego. Understanding that any emotion that controls you, be it happiness or love, can be destructive is crucial. </li>
<li><strong>Reexamining Positive Emotions</strong> : Positive emotions such as happiness, excitement, and love are not exempt from scrutiny. They can be as misleading as negative emotions and are capable of leading to self-deception and manipulation. </li>
<li><strong>Projections in Criticism</strong> : Criticisms are frequently projections of one's ego and insecurities, rather than accurate reflections of others. By dissecting these projections, one can gain self-awareness and mitigate the tendency to project onto others. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Influence on Desires and Actions</strong> : A range of cultural influences shapes desires and actions, often covertly, leading individuals to mistake these externally imposed preferences for their own authentic desires. These influences must be questioned to uncover authenticity. </li>
<li><strong>Rejecting 'Should' Statements</strong> : Moralizing 'should' statements are restrictive and stem from a lack of conscious decision-making. These should be doubted as they can tether one to a limited set of behaviors, devoid of the complexity and nuance necessary for navigating life. </li>
<li><strong>Questioning Obligation-Based Motivations</strong> : Motivations arising from a sense of duty or obligation are often misaligned with one's authentic self and contribute to issues like lack of motivation and the development of neurotic behavior patterns. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Criticism and its Impact</strong> : Subjecting oneself to harsh self-criticism, against the instinct towards self-acceptance and love, leads to self-esteem issues and inconsistent behavior patterns. This self-imposed punishment should be questioned in favor of a more nurturing approach to personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Dismantling the 'Web of Beliefs'</strong> : The so-called 'web of beliefs', or one's overall conceptual model of reality, is largely based on fiction rather than direct experience and requires deep questioning to separate fact from fiction. </li>
<li><strong>Deconstructing Identity</strong> : Identity is largely a constructed concept rather than an inherent truth. To understand one's true self, one must question the very essence of their being, stripping away constructed identities and ideologies. </li>
<li><strong>Trust in Intuition and Your Higher Self</strong> : Intuition and the higher self, which is associated with being present, open, and playful, should be trusted more than the self-preserving and aggrandizing ego. </li>
<li><strong>Reconnecting with Childhood Inspiration</strong> : Revisiting one's childhood state, minus the traumas, can serve as a guide for rediscovering an original sense of self that may have been obscured by life's bombardments of beliefs and cultural conditioning. </li>
<li><strong>Ego and Higher Self Differentiation</strong> : In the pursuit of self-trust, one must differentiate between actions and emotions emanating from the ego versus the higher self, navigating both doubt and trust to discern authentic paths in life. </li>
<li><strong>Recalling Your Original Self</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of looking back at one's childhood to understand their original self. He urges viewers to remember how they behaved, expressed themselves, and related to others as children, recognizing that not all childhood experiences may have been positive. </li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Healthy Traits from Dysfunctional Behaviors</strong> : He warns that even in childhood, there can be traumatic or negative experiences that may lead one to develop dysfunctional behaviors. It&#39;s crucial not to mistake these as being part of one's 'original self.' </li>
<li><strong>Ego's Manipulative Tactics</strong> : Leo alerts viewers to be wary of the ego, which can manipulate and distort one&#39;s viewpoints, including the idealization of the past. The ego can try to use past behaviors, like shyness, to justify current limitations, so skepticism is necessary. </li>
<li><strong>Trust in the Drive for Truth</strong> : He emphasizes that while everyone has a deep-rooted drive to discover truth, this drive can be hijacked by cultural conditioning. True pursuit of truth requires direct experiences of reality, not being distracted by beliefs or ideologies. </li>
<li><strong>Love, Compassion, and Gratitude</strong> : Leo advises that authentic emotions like unconditional love, compassion, and gratitude are trustworthy. However, one must be careful to distinguish these from ego-driven versions of these emotions, like selective love for one's own possessions or family. </li>
<li><strong>Silence and Solitude as Sources of Trust</strong> : He stresses the importance of silence and solitude, suggesting that many of life's answers are found in silent introspection, but most people distract themselves from this valuable resource. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Emotional Signals</strong> : Leo explains that emotions are accurate indicators of psychological and physiological states. However, one must learn to differentiate between surface-level reactions and deeper emotional desires to use emotions as a trustworthy guide. </li>
<li><strong>Deep Desires Versus Lower Self's Drives</strong> : He contrasts the authentic desires of the higher self, like the need for connection and beauty, with the superficial drives of the lower self. Self-development involves separating these and trusting the deeper, more profound desires. </li>
<li><strong>The Process of Identifying Trust through Doubt</strong> : Leo describes the necessity for a rigorous doubting process to truly understand what can be trusted. He advocates for extensive inquiry to identify genuine aspects of oneself that can be relied upon. </li>
<li><strong>Trusting Your Creative Muse and Awareness</strong> : He encourages trusting one's creative inspirations and natural abilities, highlighting the importance of awareness and direct conscious experience over the mind's thoughts. </li>
<li><strong>Guidance from Trusted Aspects</strong> : Leo concludes by articulating that one should take guidance from the trustworthy aspects of oneself including intuition, higher emotions, and the higher self, especially when making significant life decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of Faith</strong> : Leo remarks that faith is often mistaken for blind belief by rationally-minded people, including himself. However, real faith is about discernment – distinguishing what can and cannot be trusted, then emotionally surrendering to the things one has identified as trustworthy. </li>
<li><strong>Trust versus Blind Belief</strong> : True faith involves deeply trusting and committing to those aspects of oneself that have withstood rigorous internal scrutiny. This is not about blind belief but rather rooted in emotional surrender, where the logical mind yields to deeper emotional understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Heart Over Mind</strong> : He asserts that the logical mind should serve the heart, not dominate it. This is because the heart is ultimately a more reliable tool for making important life decisions, contrary to the popular emphasis on intellect. </li>
<li><strong>Ego versus Higher Self</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of differentiating between the ego and the higher self. This process involves both self-doubt and self-trust and requires personal engagement to discern which parts of the self to trust. </li>
<li><strong>Growth Curve for Developing Self-Trust</strong> : He describes the growth curve for developing self-trust as starting with basic trust building for those with low self-esteem and moving towards doubting everything. This growth can be taxing but is vital for development. </li>
<li><strong>Stages of Inner Development</strong> : Leo compares personal growth to child maturation, explaining that inner work is required to trust oneself, similar to how we trust a mature child with responsibilities. This development can take years. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Payoff in Personal Development</strong> : The initial stages of personal development can involve regression and overwhelming self-doubt, leading to depression. Overcoming these stages leads to self-assurance and the ability to trust oneself more. </li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goal of Complete Self-Trust</strong> : The ultimate aim is to reach a state of complete self-trust, where there is harmony within oneself. Achieving this level of trust makes life effortless and flowing but must be earned through personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Staying on Track with Personal Development</strong> : Leo advises subscribing to newsletters like Actualized.org for guidance and reminders, and emphasizes actively applying what is learned to maintain progress and develop self-trust.</li>
