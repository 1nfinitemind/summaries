            <ul>
    <li><b>Realization of the perceiver</b>: Leo had an insight that shifted his perspective; he recognized that our true identity is not the body, mind, or emotions, but the perceiver of all these aspects. He struggled with the abstract nature of the perceiver, which he describes as pure emptiness with no qualities, leading him to a deep contemplation about the essence of self and the inability to grasp it through conventional thinking.
</li><li><b>Expanded awareness through meditation</b>: During his retreat, Leo noticed an increased ability to be aware of his surroundings with a newfound quickness. Contrasting this with the usual lack of awareness needed to perform daily routines, he reminisced about a childlike attunement to life which he felt returning through increased meditation practice.
</li><li><b>Fluctuating energy and mindfulness</b>: Leo experienced a shift from a productive start to a diminishing clarity of mindfulness as the day progressed, feeling both physically and mentally tired. He recognized a drop in his ability to maintain consistent mindfulness later in the day, acknowledging both the progress made and the challenges faced.
</li><li><b>Difficulty of enlightenment</b>: Leo emphasized the immense challenge of enlightenment, noting that it requires extended, uninterrupted practice, which is daunting and often underestimated. He expressed frustration with enlightenment teachings that don't fully convey the emotional and time investment necessary for such profound spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Intensity of dedicated practice</b>: He stressed the stark contrast between casual, intermittent meditation and the deep commitment required for enlightenment, akin to the dedication of monks and yogis. Leo questioned the efficacy of short daily practices and advocated for long, continuous retreats to achieve higher states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>The misunderstanding of effort in enlightenment</b>: Leo reflected on the misleading portrayals of the path to enlightenment, criticizing the lack of transparency about the true emotional difficulty and extensive, persistent effort required to attain heightened spiritual states.
</li><li><b>Perception of awakening as a cure</b>: Leo observes that people often turn to spiritual awakening to solve their life problems, without realizing that the journey of enlightenment can bring about greater challenges, as one confronts their inner self and demons, which can be more intense than their initial troubles.
</li><li><b>Personal struggle and enlightenment's worth</b>: He reflects on the demanding nature of spiritual practice, noting how his previous life's manageable suffering pales in comparison to the emotional toil endured during his pursuit of enlightenment–a pursuit he views as a substantial investment in seeking something profound.
</li><li><b>Commitment to spiritual practice</b>: Leo discusses the extreme dedication required for radical shifts in consciousness, suggesting that without extraordinary talent or past life advantages, reaching such profound levels of enlightenment is nearly impossible for the ordinary person, emphasizing the significance of psychedelics as an avenue to understand the depth of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Appreciation for psychedelics in spiritual work</b>: Despite the temporary nature of their effects, psychedelics are praised for their ability to rapidly reveal profound states of consciousness that would take immense effort and time to achieve through meditation alone.
</li><li><b>Challenges in mastering spirituality</b>: Leo considers spirituality to be the most challenging mastery, likening it to understanding the fabric of the cosmos, an endeavor that demands great commitment as one is asking to comprehend the origins of all reality.
</li><li><b>Gratitude for chemical advancements</b>: He expresses gratitude for living in an era where substances like 5–MeO–DMT are accessible, facilitating experiences of infinite consciousness that were largely unknown a century ago, stressing the balance between valuing manual spiritual work and the insights offered via psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Respect for traditional Zen practices without psychedelics</b>: Leo acknowledges the achievements of Zen masters who accomplish spiritual progress through years of disciplined manual practice without psychedelics and muses on his own experiences and insights regarding the awakening process and spiritual purification.
