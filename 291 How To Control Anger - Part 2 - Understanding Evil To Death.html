            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/iF1q76Eiio4' target='_blank'>How To Control Anger - Part 2 - Understanding Evil To Death</a></h1>
            <p><em>"Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind." - Robert G.<br />
Ingersoll</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spectrum of Anger</strong> : Leo discusses the various levels of anger from mild annoyance to full-blown rage and points out that for those practicing personal development, the milder forms of annoyance are more common and significant, albeit often overlooked due to their subtlety. </li>
<li><strong>Hardwired Anger</strong> : He mentions a type of anger that stems from early childhood traumas, suggesting that this kind of deep-seated bitterness requires a different, more intensive approach to healing, which he does not focus on in this episode. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Understanding and Anger</strong> : Leo posits that anger arises from a lack of holistic understanding. He asserts that with a holistic and existential understanding of oneself, others, and the world, it's nearly impossible to remain angry. </li>
<li><strong>Creation and Defense of Personal Partitions</strong> : He explains that people create mental partitions that define their sense of self and reality. Defending these partitions vigorously leads to feelings of violation and outrage when others encroach upon them, which ultimately results from a failure to recognize larger systems at play. </li>
<li><strong>Larger System Dynamics</strong> : Leo highlights that individuals are part of numerous larger systems&mdash;social, cultural, corporate, familial, species&mdash;and that anger often results from not understanding these systems holistically, feeling violated when personal partitions are challenged. </li>
<li><strong>Limited Viewpoint and Holism</strong> : He suggests that anger, whether towards politics, religion, different genders, or racial issues, stems from viewing these complexities through a limited viewpoint. Instead, accommodating the reality of complex and larger systems can alleviate feelings of violation and anger. </li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness and Peace through Holism</strong> : Leo emphasizes that to be effective and at peace in the world, one needs to embrace radical open-mindedness and holistic thinking to understand and navigate the complex systems that everyone is a part of. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance through Understanding</strong> : By deeply understanding a situation or reality, people naturally move toward acceptance because they see that things could not be any other way. Acceptance then leads to peace, as it does away with rigid expectations of how reality 'should' be. </li>
<li><strong>Identifying a Lack of Understanding</strong> : Leo encourages viewers to ask themselves what they're not understanding in situations that make them angry. He suggests a practical approach to cultivating holistic understanding, starting with minor annoyances and working up to larger issues. </li>
<li><strong>Future Exploration of Anger</strong> : Leo wraps up by acknowledging that he has only covered one perspective on anger and that he will explore the topic further in future content, inviting viewers to continue practicing the techniques discussed to achieve holistic understanding and tranquility. </li>
<li><strong>Re-contextualizing Corruption</strong> : Leo suggests that by deeply understanding the root causes of corruption, one can overcome anger towards it. He believes that if anger persists, the understanding is not yet holistic enough. Studying corruption and its underlying mechanisms can transform the emotion of anger into comprehension. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic View on Lying</strong> : Leo encourages viewing lying from both one's own perspective and that of the liar. He urges contemplation on the purposes of lying and self-reflection on one's own propensity to lie. Recognizing that lying serves a function in reality can lead to a reduction in anger related to deceit. </li>
<li><strong>Injustice in Business and Relationships</strong> : By understanding the broader dynamics of injustice in relationships or business, one can alleviate anger. Leo asks viewers to investigate the root causes of unfairness and see beyond personal injustice, leading to greater emotional tranquility. </li>
<li><strong>Transforming Anger Post-Trauma</strong> : Leo recognizes that victims of severe injustices like rape may initially feel intense anger, but through a process of forgiveness and understanding, they may develop compassion for the perpetrator by understanding their background and the role ignorance plays in enabling such acts. </li>
<li><strong>Applying Holistic Principles to Daily Annoyances</strong> : Leo explains how applying the principle of holistic understanding to minor everyday grievances, such as noise disturbances or a partner's irritating habits, can alleviate feelings of annoyance and anger. </li>
<li><strong>Advanced Consciousness and the Erasure of Self/Other Partitions</strong> : By dissolving the distinction between self and other, one can reach a state of overwhelming love and acceptance. Leo illustrates this using a personal anecdote of meditation and recognizing that he and the bird making noise were not separate, leading to peace. </li>
<li><strong>Addressing Objections to Understanding Evil</strong> : Leo addresses the concern that understanding and accepting evil could encourage chaos. He clarifies that acceptance doesn't lead to unchecked evil, but can actually diminish its impact through peace and diminished emotional reactions. </li>
<li><strong>Justification and Utility of Outrage</strong> : Leo contends that letting go of outrage doesn't diminish one's efficacy in the world; instead, it leads to more effective action. Anger can be motivating, but there are higher-quality motivations derived from love and positivity that are healthier and lead to less stress and ailments. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance over Resistance in Combating Evil</strong> : Leo discusses the paradoxical approach of accepting evil to mitigate its power. He argues that anger and resistance are components that help perpetuate evil, while acceptance can disarm it. Understanding and acceptance can make the notion of evil, which is often a product of a limited perspective, less potent. </li>
<li><strong>Evil from Holistic Perspective</strong> : From the most holistic and existential perspective, what's labeled as evil may just be an aspect of one unified reality not aligning with personal agendas. Accepting reality in its entirety, without demanding that one's perspective dominate, can alleviate suffering and effectively confront evil by understanding it to such depth that it ceases to provoke an emotional response. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Development Through Acceptance</strong> : Leo presents holistic understanding and acceptance as ideals to strive for in personal development. He shares his experiences of dealing with perceived injustices and learning to view them within the context of larger systems, which has led to greater acceptance and reduced negativity in his own life. </li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Purification and Grasping the Truth of Reality</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of making peace with reality as a profound breakthrough. He emphasizes that coming to terms with reality, especially when facing adverse situations, is a test of one's ability to handle truth without outrage or ego. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Technique for Anger Management</strong> : Leo provides a technique for practicing acceptance by pausing during anger to consider the overlooked perspective and asking, "What am I failing to understand?" He advises to keep digging for understanding until acceptance is reached and suggests starting with minor annoyances before tackling more significant issues. </li>
<li><strong>Holism in Life and Future Exploration</strong> : Leo hints at further exploration of holism and understanding anger in future discussions. He encourages viewers to seek and practice holistic perspectives in all aspects of life and to stay tuned for more comprehensive insights on managing anger.</li>
