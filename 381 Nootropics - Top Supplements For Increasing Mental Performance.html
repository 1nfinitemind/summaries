            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/gQQrrCjZyPc' target='_blank'>Nootropics - Top Supplements For Increasing Mental Performance</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Nootropics Overview</b>: Nootropics are mental performance–enhancing supplements used by biohackers and others to support cognitive function. Leo has personally found nootropics valuable for managing his hypoactive thyroid, chronic fatigue, brain fog, and the cognitive demands of his work.
</li><li><b>Warnings and Research</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of not treating nootropics as medical advice and advises viewers to research each substance thoroughly, considering their medical conditions and any other medications. 
</li><li><b>Personal Introduction to Nootropics</b>: Leo's cognitive performance felt like it was declining, a change he noticed before experimenting with psychedelics. Factors such as aging and the intensity of cognitive tasks affect brain performance, which he seeks to optimize.
</li><li><b>Nootropics' Functionality and Benefits</b>: These supplements can take a person from dysfunctional to functional or from functional to a new level of performance. They address issues ranging from chronic fatigue to depression but should not be expected to cure root causes.
</li><li><b>Experimentation and Customization</b>: Finding the right nootropics involves experimentation and customization for one's unique brain and mind, considering various personal and genetic factors.
</li><li><b>Primary Nootropic – Modafinil</b>: Modafinil, a prescription drug also known as Provigil, is non–addictive, non–stimulating, and creates a state of wakefulness and cognitive fluidity for about 10 hours. It is ideal for intellectual work, meditation, and consciousness work. Initially developed for narcoleptics, it has unique mechanisms not fully understood by science.
</li><li><b>Effects and Usage of Modafinil</b>: The drug's effects include improved alertness, creativity, and mood, with a smooth onboarding and comedown process. Leo cuts the pill into quarters to avoid excessive stimulation and heart rate increase.
</li><li><b>Modafinil's Profile and Cautions</b>: While non–addictive, it's powerful and shouldn't become a crutch. Cycling on and off is recommended to prevent tolerance, and no serious cravings or withdrawal symptoms have been noted in personal experience.
</li><li><b>Modafinil's side effects</b>: Modafinil can cause headache, dizziness, nausea, upset stomach, dry mouth, runny nose, insomnia, increased heart rate, and heart palpitations. An extremely rare serious skin reaction may occur. Leo has personally experienced only increased heart rate and sometimes a runny nose at higher doses but no other listed side effects.
</li><li><b>Cycling Method for Modafinil</b>: To prevent tolerance build–up, Modafinil should be cycled, potentially using it for workdays and taking breaks on weekends, or alternately taking it for a few weeks followed by a week off.
</li><li><b>Long–Term Safety of Modafinil</b>: Millions of people have been prescribed Modafinil, and there is no clinical evidence of serious long–term health problems. However, monitoring liver health is recommended, and it might be best not to use Modafinil continuously for many years.
</li><li><b>Differences between Modafinil and Armodafinil</b>: Armodafinil is a more potent version of Modafinil, providing longer–lasting wakefulness and adjusting the side effect profile. For instance, Armodafinil can cause a runny nose during its onset without other major side effects that Modafinil may pose.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics vs. Modafinil</b>: Modafinil doesn't induce visual hallucinations and is less than 1% as potent as powerful psychedelics. It allows productive work, unlike psychedelics, which can hinder work capacity.
</li><li><b>Armodafinil as a Spiritual Tool</b>: Armodafinil could serve as an aid for those struggling to see the benefits of meditation or spirituality by granting a taste of expanded consciousness. It should not replace daily meditation but act as a lever for spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Sourcing and Cost Efficiency of Modafinil/Armodafinil</b>: In the US, these drugs are expensive and require a prescription, but in India, brands like Mode Alert and Art Vigil are available for around $1.50 per pill. Indian versions offer the same quality as US brands and are considered a reasonable risk to cost savings.
</li><li><b>Responsibility and Safety With Nootropic Use</b>: It is essential to start with a small dose and ideally get blood work done annually to monitor one's health when taking nootropics like Modafinil or Armodafinil. The use should be reasonable and respect potential legal and health risks.
</li><li><b>Smart Testing of Modafinil</b>: To ensure safety, start with a small dose of Modafinil to check for any allergic reactions or adverse effects before taking a full dose.
</li><li><b>Recommendations for Modafinil Prescription</b>: Leo suggests consulting a doctor and discussing symptoms like chronic fatigue, concentration difficulties, ADHD, depression, or mood issues to possibly obtain a prescription for Modafinil.
</li><li><b>Lion's Mane Mushrooms</b>: This traditional Chinese herb promotes neurogenesis, brain cell regeneration, improves memory, cognition, focus, alertness, and may alleviate depression and anxiety. It is recommended for its natural and potentially non–problematic profile at doses up to 500 milligrams.
</li><li><b>L–Theanine's Benefits</b>: Found in green tea, doses of 200 to 400 milligrams can relax, reduce blood pressure and heart rate, promote alpha and theta brainwaves, increase focus and awareness without jitters, protect neurons, improve mood, cognition, and sleep quality without drowsiness.
</li><li><b>Huperzine A for Cognitive Enhancement and Dream Vividness</b>: This Chinese club moss derivative, at 50 to 200 micrograms, can enhance short–term memory, support long–term brain health, increase energy through mitochondrial support, and affect dream vividness, beneficial for lucid dreaming or dream work.
</li><li><b>Alpha GPC's Role in Cognitive Enhancement</b>: At 400 to 1,200 milligrams, Alpha GPC provides a bioavailable source of choline for improved memory, mood, mental energy, cognitive performance, and nerve growth, acting synergistically with other nootropics.
</li><li><b>Tarot Stilbene for Brain Health</b>: This antioxidant from blueberries and grapes, at 50 milligrams, increases neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, improves cognition, learning, mood, fights aging effects, and reduces anxiety.
</li><li><b>Precautions with 5–HTP</b>: A precursor to serotonin, 5–HTP can improve anxiety, depression, and stress at 200 milligrams, but should not be taken with antidepressant medications.
</li><li><b>Sulbutiamine for Improved Focus and Attention</b>: As a synthetic version of vitamin B1, Sulbutiamine enhances focus, motivation, and mood but requires cycling to avoid quick tolerance buildup.
</li><li><b>Synergistic Effect of Nootropics</b>: Combining Sulbutiamine, Alpha GPC and Uridine can create synergistic effects to further boost cognitive performance.
</li><li><b>Vinpocetine's Effects</b>: This plant–derived alkaloid enhances blood flow to the brain, cognitive functions, and neuron protection, while reducing inflammation at a dose of 10 milligrams multiple times per day.
</li><li><b>Value of Anecdotal Evidence</b>: Anecdotal evidence from personal experiences with nootropics is highly regarded due to the limitations of conservative scientific research, which often overlooks individual differences and real–world effects.
</li><li><b>N–Acetyl L–Tyrosine's Benefits for ADHD</b>: Highly bioavailable L–tyrosine improves cognition, memory, mental stress, mood, and is particularly useful for ADHD, especially when cycled.
</li><li><b>Phosphatidylserine's Cognitive Benefits</b>: At 300 milligrams, this phospholipid improves brain cell health and contributes to cognitive performance, memory, and neuron growth.
</li><li><b>Phosphatidylserine's cognitive benefits</b>: Phosphatidylserine improves brain health, promotes neuron growth, enhances cognitive performance, memory, focus, reduces ADHD symptoms, and decreases beta brainwaves, which are associated with the active, thinking mind.
</li><li><b>Bacopa Monnieri's dual effects</b>: Bacopa Monnieri, an Indian adaptogen herb also known as Brahmi, aids in memory, learning, focus, and reduces anxiety. It has immediate effects on anxiety and long–term memory enhancements after 4–6 weeks of daily intake.
</li><li><b>Age factor in supplement effectiveness</b>: Young individuals with healthy brains may not notice significant benefits from certain supplements, whereas older adults may experience pronounced improvements in mental performance due to age–related cognitive decline.
</li><li><b>N–Acetylcysteine (NAC) for immune support</b>: NAC, a naturally occurring amino acid, regulates dopamine and is a precursor to glutathione, enhancing immune system functions. Helpful in responding to early cold or flu symptoms, it also acts as a neuroprotectant and supports brain health.
</li><li><b>PQQ for mitochondrial growth</b>: Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) helps in growing new mitochondria, increasing nerve growth factor, and improving memory and cognition. The effects might take up to a month to be noticeable.
</li><li><b>CoQ10 for older adults</b>: Coenzyme Q10 energizes mitochondria and acts as an antioxidant, benefiting brain cell protection, mental clarity, and cardiac health, especially in older individuals.
</li><li><b>Uridine's mood and cognitive benefits</b>: Uridine, a naturally occurring component in RNA, boosts dopamine release, mood, cognition, and memory, especially when paired with other supplements like fish oil.
</li><li><b>Ginkgo Biloba for brain circulation</b>: Ginkgo Biloba increases blood circulation in the brain, aiding memory, cognition, learning, and mood. Continuous use over several weeks is needed for noticeable effects.
</li><li><b>Fish/Krill oil and Vitamin D3 for overall health</b>: These supplements are not strictly nootropics but are crucial for brain function and overall health. Vitamin D3 deficiencies are common, and prolonged supplementation is recommended to reach optimal levels.
</li><li><b>Anecdotal evidence of supplement effectiveness</b>: Personal stories and reviews suggest that these supplements have been beneficial for many, despite the possibility of some being fake. Individuals should still experiment to assess how these substances affect them personally.
</li><li><b>Method of supplement intake</b>: Nootropics should be taken with food, like a banana, to prevent nausea. Personal experimentation with dosages is essential, and it is not necessary to take them daily.
</li><li><b>Continuous Experimentation with Nootropics</b>: Leo Gura continues to experiment with various nootropics in different combinations or "stacks," occasionally reducing the number to fine–tune the effects. He takes modafinil and armodafinil in the morning with food to prevent sleep disturbances later in the day.
</li><li><b>Stacking Nootropics with Spiritual Practices</b>: Leo finds combining meditation, Kriya yoga, and self–inquiry with certain nootropics greatly enhances the state of alertness and consciousness, which he equates with true pleasure rather than a euphoric high.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Quality with Supplements</b>: He recommends purchasing high–quality, organic supplements, stressing the importance of purity and avoiding additives, even if they are more expensive, especially for long–term use.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Certain Substances</b>: Leo lists substances to avoid, including adrafinil due to its liver impact, racetams for their potentially unhealthy stimulating effects, and antidepressants due to their severe side effects, addiction potential, and difficulty in discontinuing. He also cautions against stimulants, amphetamines, and caffeine for their potential for creating dependencies.
</li><li><b>Critique of Weed for Spiritual Purposes</b>: While acknowledging that some people use weed for spiritual purposes without addiction, he points out it's often habit–forming and used for escapism. He suggests considering other substances that don't have these addictive qualities.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics vs. Habit–forming Substances</b>: Leo clarifies that his support for psychedelics, despite cautioning against other drugs like weed or ketamine, is because they are not habit–forming. He stresses this aspect as critical for their safe use.
</li><li><b>Combining Supplements Cautiously</b>: He urges extreme caution when combining nootropics with any medication or psychedelics, advising a gradual approach by starting with small quantities and one substance at a time to monitor for unforeseen synergistic effects.
</li><li><b>Self–testing and Tailored Nootropic Use</b>: Stressing the individual nature of nootropic effects, Leo encourages personal research and gradual self–testing, starting with small doses and progressively increasing them, to find the optimal personal stack.
</li><li><b>Nootropic Information Sharing and Forums</b>: He points out that online forums and communities play a crucial role in sharing experiences and stacks, and they should be utilized for anyone interested in nootropics.
</li><li><b>Investment in Nootropic Research</b>: Leo suggests viewers be ready to invest around $500 for a robust experimentation with nootropics, balancing the financial cost against the potential long–term benefits to work performance and overall health. However, he cautions that nootropics should not be a financial priority over fundamental needs.
</li><li><b>Nootropics should not Replace Healthy Habits</b>: Finally, Leo emphasizes that nootropics are not substitutes for a good diet, healthy lifestyle, or adequate sleep. They should complement these foundational practices, not replace them.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Nootropics</b>: Nootropics are not meant to enable workaholism or unhealthy lifestyles. They can't compensate for unsustainable work habits or replace the need for quality personal development, like addressing deep–seated psychological issues or maintaining proper study habits.
</li><li><b>Nootropics as motivational tools</b>: Rather than replacing spiritual practices like meditation or yoga, nootropics should be used to enhance motivation and deepen these practices. For example, armodafinil can increase the desire to engage in such activities.
</li><li><b>Health monitoring</b>: Regular health check–ups, including annual blood work, are necessary to monitor for potential adverse effects on liver, kidney, and nutrient levels when using nootropics.
</li><li><b>Community and forum discussions</b>: Actualized.org's forum and other external forums provide platforms for users to share experiences, stacks, and engage in discussions about nootropics, contributing to a collective knowledge base.
</li><li><b>Commitment to self–actualization journey</b>: Following Leo's content consistently can lead to discoveries across various domains of personal development, including nootropics, which might have otherwise been unknown to the viewer.
</li><li><b>Resisting superficial judgments</b>: Leo advises against judging the content by titles alone, as it may cause viewers to miss out on transformative information that doesn't seem immediately relevant or attractive.
</li><li><b>Identifying limitations of mainstream culture</b>: Mainstream marketing often promotes low–consciousness products, and viewers are encouraged to look for alternative, high–consciousness sources like Actualized.org for substantial life changes.
</li><li><b>Exploration and experimentation</b>: Embrace an attitude of being an explorer and experimenter in various facets of life to uncover potentially life–changing tools and practices, even those that are not yet widely known or appreciated.
