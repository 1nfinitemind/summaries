            <ul>
    <li><b>Truth realization versus morality</b>: Enlightenment reveals the morally neutral nature of reality, while morality is a humanâ€“made construct which invites examination of its purposes and efficacy.
</li><li><b>Perceived morality in enlightenment</b>: Enlightened individuals may seem more moral because operating from falsehoods becomes patently absurd to them. Lying and deceit are recognized as dysfunctional and irrelevant.
</li><li><b>Honesty as personal alignment with truth</b>: Enlightened people strive for honesty not as a moral imperative but as a personal mandate to remain consistent with truth across all levels, including factual details.
</li><li><b>Freedom from self and societal motives</b>: Enlightenment bestows freedom from selfish motivations, leading to behavior that appears moral. However, this is really an expression of authentic humanity unburdened by deceptive or selfish impulses.
