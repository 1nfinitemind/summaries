            <ul>
    <li><b>Quantity vs. Quality of Friends</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the quality of friendships over their quantity. He believes that having a few deep, supportive, and aligned friendships is far more satisfying than having numerous superficial connections.
</li><li><b>Investment in Friendships</b>: Friendships require investment of both time and energy. Leo suggests that one should consider how much of these resources they can and are willing to invest in each friendship to reap the desired benefits of companionship and mutual growth.
</li><li><b>Not Socializing</b>: Leo identifies that a common barrier to making friends is not socializing enough. Staying home or being confined to work limits the opportunity to meet and interact with new people, thus hindering the ability to form friendships.
</li><li><b>Lacking Time and Energy for Friends</b>: Leo points out the problem of not having enough time and energy for maintaining friendships. He encourages viewers to reprioritize their schedules, possibly by reducing time–wasting activities, to create space for meaningful interactions with friends.
</li><li><b>Ruining Potential Friendships by Being Judgmental</b>: Leo suggests that some people ruin the chance of lasting friendships by being too judgmental of others. He admits that while his introverted nature sometimes limits his socializing, losing friends due to judgmental behavior is not an issue he personally faces.
</li><li><b>Open–mindedness in friendship</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of not being judgmental and open–minded when meeting new people. He points out that preconceived judgments can prevent the formation of potential friendships and suggests being more receptive to people's differences to foster learning and connection.
</li><li><b>Value alignment vs. acquaintance</b>: While Leo acknowledges that perfect value alignment might not always be possible, he suggests that one can still maintain a loose acquaintance with someone if there's not a perfect match. He recommends giving people a chance and spending time with them before making a final judgment.
</li><li><b>Authenticity in interactions</b>: Leo discusses the importance of being authentic and sharing personal interests in conversations to form genuine connections. He warns that being fake or overly reserved can deter potential friends, as people are naturally drawn to authenticity.
</li><li><b>Taking initiative in friendships</b>: To develop friendships, Leo advises taking the initiative in social situations, especially in the early stages. He emphasizes the need to actively share personal ideas and interests because expecting the other person to do all the work is unrealistic.
</li><li><b>Increasing social exposure</b>: Leo identifies a lack of socializing as a major obstacle to making friends. He recommends joining groups, clubs, organizations, or attending events as ways to become more socially active and alleviate issues of shyness and fakeness through increased interaction.
</li><li><b>Cross–pollination through diverse friendships</b>: By having friends with different beliefs and backgrounds, Leo explains that one can experience profound personal growth and exposure to new ideas, emphasizing the value of diverse friendships in creating a more open–minded perspective and experiencing life–changing events.
