            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/sRvQlgu_bRs' target='_blank'>How Corruption Works</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Persistent nature of corruption</b>: Despite 10,000 years of human evolution, corruption is still prevalent, hinting at deep–rooted reasons we don't yet understand.
</li><li><b>Existential inquiry into corruption</b>: Addressing corruption effectively requires questioning its fundamental nature and the underlying mechanics rather than dismissing it as simply the actions of a few "bad" individuals.
</li><li><b>Corruption beyond government</b>: The misconception that corruption is limited to governments is dismissed, with recognition that corruption pervades across all parties, governments, organizations, and eras.
</li><li><b>Corruption as a synonym for evil</b>: Combating corruption is akin to combating evil, a concept deeply intertwined with the understanding of corruption.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding corruption's roots</b>: The irony is that misinterpretations of corruption's causes add to the problem, deepening its impact.
</li><li><b>Support for Actualized.org</b>: Leo highlights the support for his channel through Patreon donations, which allows for improvements and avoiding ads and sponsorships that could influence content.
</li><li><b>Corruptibility of minds and systems</b>: From political parties to media and gaming industries, corruption originates in the mind and manifests in external systems like Hollywood's focus on profit over artistry.
</li><li><b>Definitions of corruption</b>: Multiple dictionary definitions underscore corruption as an act involving abuse of power, personal gain, departure from originality, and various forms of decay or change in meaning.
</li><li><b>Selfishness, ego, survival as motivators</b>: The roots of corruption are synonymous with survival strategies, ego and selfish behavior, also referred to as devilry.
</li><li><b>Identification with corrupt actions</b>: Corruption is difficult to observe within oneself but easily spotted in others, stemming from personal survival mechanisms and one's perceived identity.
</li><li><b>Accepting personal responsibility for corruption</b>: True anti–corruption efforts require acceptance of personal corruption rather than solely attributing it to external sources.
</li><li><b>The practice of shifting blame</b>: Politicians and others in power often blame external entities for corruption to distract from internal issues, avoiding self–reflection and accountability.
</li><li><b>Personal declaration of corruption</b>: Leo challenges listeners to acknowledge their own role in perpetuating corruption and evil by declaring themselves as contributors to the issue.
</li><li><b>Admission of Personal Corruption</b>: Recognizing and owning personal corruption is the crucial first step for change, akin to an alcoholic admitting their addiction. Most people never take this step because it involves confronting one's role in the collective corruption of society or even the entire human species. 
</li><li><b>Collective Responsibility</b>: As a member of any society, one should accept responsibility for the systemic corruption within it, like how Americans might benefit from the nation's military actions internationally, which serve business interests at the cost of others.
</li><li><b>The Unpopular Nature of Corruption Reform</b>: Addressing corruption often becomes unpopular because it requires individuals to recognize and change themselves, which is generally the last thing one wants to do. Facing internal corruption can be more daunting than fighting perceived external evils.
</li><li><b>Corrupt People as Ordinary Individuals</b>: Corrupt individuals are usually not inherently evil but are ordinary people reacting to situations of power and temptation. Their corrupt acts stem from an instinct for survival and the desire to fulfill personal needs such as money or power.
</li><li><b>Underestimation of Power's Temptation</b>: Climbing the social hierarchy increases temptations and amplifies personal ambition. People often don't realize how these temptations can change them, leading to entitlement and potential for corruption, especially when powerful.
</li><li><b>Corruption as Self–Deception</b>: People justify their corruption, seeing themselves as righteous. Corruption occurs first through self–deception–convincing oneself of being above reproach–so one can engage in corrupt behavior without personal guilt, viewing corruption as a trait of others.
</li><li><b>Practicality and Transcendence in Combating Corruption</b>: Combatting corruption involves developing a consciousness that recognizes self–preservation's flaws. Understanding that practicalities can be a trap, and escaping the need for everything to be practical, is a higher form of being.
</li><li><b>Self–Deception Acknowledgment</b>: Even those aware of corruption and self–deception, like Leo himself, are not immune to these issues. Awareness and the constant vigilance against self–deception are vital, yet there are no guarantees against falling into its traps. 
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Objectivity</b>: Truly overcoming corruption requires an objective evaluation of one's own beliefs, recognizing self–bias and the difficulty of objectively assessing one's worldview. This self–awareness is essential to admitting personal faults and corruption.
</li><li><b>Personal resistance to acknowledging corruption</b>: Accepting one's own corruption is difficult due to the need to maintain a positive self–image. When confronted with corrupt actions, individuals may feel attacked, unloved, and reluctant to change due to an identity clash between being an angel and being perceived as a devil.
</li><li><b>The strenuous process of becoming an 'angel'</b>: Becoming a metaphorical angel, someone who transcends their corruption, is a challenging journey. It involves emotional turmoil, self–disgust, and existential insecurity. This purification path feels like a battle between one's devilish tendencies and the illuminating force of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Low consciousness and justification of corruption</b>: People are often unconscious of their own corruption, rationalizing it through mental gymnastics and self–deception. Recognizing one's own corruption requires a higher level of consciousness and the ability to spot self–deception, a trait lacking in a significant portion of the population.
</li><li><b>Culture as a medium for corruption</b>: Corruption is deeply embedded in culture, spanning across various sectors such as entertainment, media, religion, business, and science. Over generations, institutions inherit and manifest their predecessors' ideologies, which often contain inherent corruption due to lack of scrutiny and conformity.
</li><li><b>The dangers of conformism</b>: Conformist thinking leads to accepting cultural paradigms uncritically, reinforcing corrupt systems. When ideas and norms are adopted through conformity, the process becomes flawed, regardless of the truth of those ideas.
</li><li><b>Denial of cultural corruption due to loyalty</b>: Loyalty to one's culture often leads to denial of corruption within it. This conflict between loyalty and truth results in condemning those who point out corruption while preserving one's own identity and cultural attachments.
</li><li><b>Institutional denial of corruption</b>: Institutions facing allegations of corruption, like modern science, may deny any wrongdoing to protect their image and survival. Reformers pointing out corruptions are often met with accusations of being harmful or anti–establishment as a defense mechanism.
</li><li><b>Reflecting on systemic and individual corruption</b>: To address corruption, reflection on both personal and systemic levels is necessary. Seeking wisdom outside of conformist channels and questioning existing structures can help expose and prevent the perpetuation of corruption.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Scientific Foundations</b>: Leo criticizes the epistemic foundations of science, which he claims are never questioned and taken for granted by scientists. When challenged, scientists tend to fall back on skepticism and the traditional methods they've been taught, illustrating the cycle of corruption in science.
</li><li><b>Science and Skepticism</b>: When questioning science's fundamental assumptions, scientists often react defensively, asking for proof and citing rigorous methodologies, which Leo sees as a programmed response ingrained during their education.
</li><li><b>Demonization of Whistleblowers</b>: Across different domains, especially politics and government, individuals who call out corruption are often demonized and even killed. Leo emphasizes the historical trend where those exposing flaws are mistreated and regarded as traitors rather than reformers.
</li><li><b>Military Corruption Example</b>: Leo suggests that, ideally, if a soldier exposes corruption within the military, they should be rewarded for improving the institution. Instead, such individuals face retaliation and are brandished as traitors, reflecting the inverse reaction to exposing systemic issues.
</li><li><b>Inquisition and Heresy</b>: Drawing parallels with the Spanish Inquisition, Leo explains that those labeled as heretics were often trying to reform the church. He says the Catholic Church, which still faces issues like the pedophilia scandal, is resistant to self–examination and reform due to deep identification with its image and dogma.
</li><li><b>Admitting Institutional Devilry</b>: Leo discusses the emotional difficulty for individuals to acknowledge that their lifelong dedication to an institution, like the Catholic Church, may have facilitated "devilry" or corruption, rather than the divine work they believed in.
</li><li><b>Whistleblowers and Corporate Culture</b>: He continues with the example of corporate whistleblowers who, rather than being rewarded for exposing corruption, are often fired and blacklisted, reflecting the corporate defense against threats to its ideologies and survival.
</li><li><b>Projection of Corruption onto Reformers</b>: Leo describes a dynamic where corrupt individuals project their own corruption onto those who attempt to rectify it, viewing the reformers as devils disrupting the status quo.
</li><li><b>Call–out Culture in Science</b>: When one points out the limitations and issues within the scientific paradigm, the likely response from reputable scientists is denouncement and denial due to being entrenched in their existing worldview. 
</li><li><b>Defense against Corruption as Corruption</b>: Leo argues that trying to defend against corruption can ironically lead to further corruption. For example, rigid religious orthodoxy aimed at preserving doctrinal purity actually perpetuates corruption by following a conformist and mechanical approach to spirituality.
</li><li><b>Orthodox Conformism</b>: He posits that adherence to religious orthodoxy under the guise of maintaining purity is itself corruption, stemming from conformity rather than true spiritual understanding.
</li><li><b>The Devil's Use of Conformity</b>: Leo suggests the devil plays upon conformity, knowing individuals will follow new rules without scrutiny, effectively spreading corruption within religious and spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Misconception about protecting teachings</b>: The act of rigidly memorizing and replicating teachings, as done by some gurus, unintentionally leads to corruption, as it turns into a mechanical process that deviates from the essence of consciousness, which is non–mechanical and independent.
</li><li><b>Consciousness vs. mechanical preservation</b>: Consciousness is about independent thought and recognizing oneself as the ultimate authority. Mechanical attempts to safeguard teachings or practices–whether religious or scientific–often distort the original message and contribute to corruption.
</li><li><b>Independent thinking over external authority</b>: Relying on external authorities for guidance, in religion or science, is a misstep that results in corruption. True consciousness requires self–guidance rather than adhering to an external figure's dictates.
</li><li><b>Limits of rigid rationality in science</b>: Rigorous scientific methods can inadvertently ignore broader realities, much like a strict antivirus program that blocks necessary software. This overly stringent approach can create blind spots in science and lead to corrupt practices.
</li><li><b>Generational distortion of teachings</b>: The process of transferring knowledge from one generation to another is akin to a game of telephone, where each copy introduces errors, ultimately leading to grave distortions like widespread institutional corruption over time.
</li><li><b>Corruption's connection to lack of consciousness</b>: Corruption stems from a lack of consciousness and cannot be mechanically prevented. To address corruption, individuals must develop consciousness and think independently.
</li><li><b>Corruption from Maya or 'the devil'</b>: Corruption is attributed to Maya, or the 'devil,' which uses universal intelligence for personal gain. Ego–driven humans distort and narrow universal intelligence, which should be used instead to disseminate consciousness and love.
</li><li><b>Devil's tactics in corruption</b>: The devil's strategy includes corrupting influential institutions because it enables widespread deception and corruption. Individuals in positions of power are targeted to disseminate corruption down through society.
</li><li><b>Misguided fight against corruption</b>: Those who loudly oppose corruption externally might be using it as a facade to hide their own corrupt actions. The real battle against corruption is internal, focusing on personal transformation of devilry.
</li><li><b>Islam's inner vs. outer jihad</b>: Islam was originally about the inner journey to eradicate personal corruption, representing the greater jihad, but has since been externalized into the lesser jihad of fighting enemies, losing its essence in the process.
</li><li><b>Integrity and its false display</b>: There's a difference between genuine integrity, which is a function of high consciousness and moral development, and mere ideological or performative integrity that can be used to hide corruption.
</li><li><b>The relationship between Spiral Dynamics and Corruption</b>: Lower stages on Spiral Dynamics, which are associated with limited consciousness, tend to be more corrupt. Tier 2 consciousness is key to curbing corruption as it allows individuals to recognize and overcome their biases and corruptions.
</li><li><b>Corruption in Third World Countries</b>: Leo notes that corruption is inevitable in third–world countries where survival is a day–to–day struggle due to scarce resources, making people resort to corruption just to feed their children and secure basic human needs.
</li><li><b>Corruption Index</b>: A corruption index tracks and ranks the corruption levels of every country, showing the correlation between a nation's corruption and its collective consciousness. Countries with scores below 50 are considered highly corrupt and undesirable places to live.
</li><li><b>Impact of Corruption on Development</b>: In severely corrupt countries, normal societal development and individual self–actualization are almost impossible as businesses may have to pay bribes to operate, and entrepreneurs are often extorted by local mafias.
</li><li><b>Selfishness and Selflessness in Leadership</b>: Leo discusses the paradox where selflessness emerges as a stronger force than selfishness. Despite the risks, selfless leaders, who cannot be faked, inspire true societal progress and can effect change even in the face of opposition or violence.
</li><li><b>Understanding Corruption's Importance</b>: Understanding corruption is essential, not just for politicians but for everyone in society who participates in communities and organizations, to effectively handle dynamics and recognize corruption.
</li><li><b>Corruption in Society's Leadership</b>: Effective leaders attempting to raise collective consciousness face significant challenges, including possibly being ousted by the public if their ideas are too progressive relative to the majority's comfort zone.
</li><li><b>Policing and Corruption</b>: Policing within communities and online platforms like forums, Facebook, or YouTube exemplifies the struggle of combating corruption without being too oppressive–a difficult balance to achieve.
</li><li><b>Leadership and the Evolution of Communities</b>: The speed at which a community evolves is limited by the ordinary, conformist majority's capacity to accept and integrate ideas from higher–consciousness leaders, who can be targeted and removed for suggesting significant changes.
</li><li><b>The Limiting Bottleneck of Community Evolution</b>: Communities can only evolve as fast as the majority will allow; when a leader's ideas are too advanced, the relevancy gap can lead to the community rejecting and removing the leader from power, mistaking progressive ideas for harm.
</li><li><b>Catch–22 of Conscious Leadership</b>: To establish high–consciousness leaders, a society needs citizens with high consciousness capable of appreciating such leaders, creating a challenging cycle as each depends on the other for existence.
</li><li><b>School System Influence</b>: The school system reflects society's prevailing level of consciousness and is slow to evolve due to its connection to conformist traditional values of the society that establishes educational leadership.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Progressive Education</b>: Highly conscious and reformative education leaders face resistance from the conformist majority, risking dismissal if their reforms challenge deeply held traditional values or expose systemic corruption.
</li><li><b>Projection of Corruption</b>: Accusations of corruption can often be a form of projection, as in the case of Socrates accused of corrupting the youth, or Donald Trump's 'drain the swamp' campaign, while himself exhibiting corrupt behaviors.
</li><li><b>Trump Administration Corruption</b>: The Trump administration is used as an example of significant corruption, where cronyism and financial improprieties are prevalent among President Trump and his appointees, visible through numerous scandals and resignations.
</li><li><b>Partisanship and Corruption Perception</b>: The discourse on corruption in politics is often seen through partisan lenses, but awareness of differential levels of corruption in political entities is crucial for making informed judgments beyond partisanship.
</li><li><b>Spiral Dynamics and Corruption</b>: According to Spiral Dynamics, higher stages are less corrupt due to reduced egotism, and it is posited that liberals are generally higher on this spiral than conservatives, suggesting less corruption.
</li><li><b>Causes of Government Corruption</b>: Government corruption's prevalence ties back to the vast pool of money and power within it, with corruption manipulated by powerful and wealthy entities through mechanisms like lobbying and deregulation.
</li><li><b>Size of Government and Corruption</b>: A larger, strong government is posited as necessary for managing and overseeing powerful corporations, ensuring holistic functioning towards the common good and preventing hostile takeovers.
</li><li><b>Amazon as a Potential Oligarchy</b>: As an example, Amazon could, in theory, amass enough power to challenge or overtake government functions, illustrating the risk when corporations become too powerful relative to the government.
</li><li><b>Government Corruption and Oligarchy</b>: The current evolution of democracy is regressing into an oligarchy reminiscent of past civilizations like the Roman Empire. To counteract this, a larger and, more crucially, cleaner government is necessary. 
</li><li><b>Trump as an Example of Corruption</b>: Using Trump as an illustration, it's suggested that declaring to "drain the swamp" does not equate to actual anti–corruption measures, especially when the person lacks the moral and consciousness levels required for such tasks.
</li><li><b>Historical Fight Against Corruption</b>: Society's relative stability and safety are the result of continuous efforts against corruption throughout history, showing the importance of civic engagement and individual responsibility.
</li><li><b>Money in Politics</b>: Highlights the detrimental effects of corporate lobbying and political contributions on US democracy. Advocates for a constitutional amendment and public funding for elections to ensure one person equals one vote.
</li><li><b>Wolf Pack Organization</b>: Leo encourages support for Wolf Pack, a nonpartisan group working to eliminate money from politics through a constitutional amendment.
</li><li><b>Theory and Practice of Fighting Corruption</b>: Emphasizes the importance of connecting big–picture understanding with practical actions, such as donating to causes like Wolf Pack, to combat corruption effectively.
</li><li><b>Personal Corruption</b>: Viewers are urged to admit to and notice their everyday corrupt actions, such as cheating, lying, or favoritism. These micro corruptions can expand into larger issues when individuals gain more power.
</li><li><b>Awareness as a Solution for Corruption</b>: Acknowledges that bringing to light corrupt acts through awareness, like how Trump's actions are publicly scrutinized, helps society progress by exposing the ugliness of corruption.
</li><li><b>Corruption Tended by Technological and Cultural Evolution</b>: Points out that as society and technology evolve, new avenues for corruption emerge, necessitating better laws and education to curb these issues.
</li><li><b>Improving Life Quality to Reduce Corruption</b>: Proposes that helping improve overall prosperity and meeting basic needs can decrease the need for corruption in desperate societies such as Liberia.
</li><li><b>Moral and Spiritual Growth to End Corruption</b>: Stresses the role of personal moral and spiritual development in eradicating corruption, urging viewers to purify themselves of corrupt tendencies.
</li><li><b>Techniques to Resolve Personal Corruption</b>: Suggestions are made for techniques to combat personal corruption, including working on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Kriya yoga, self–inquiry, shadow work, and fostering love.
</li><li><b>Collective Action and Transparency</b>: Besides personal growth, collective actions such as supporting reforms and practicing transparency are vital to fight widespread corruption.
</li><li><b>Consciousness, Truth, Love, and Spirit</b>: Argues that increasing levels of consciousness, truth, love, and spirit are the ultimate solutions to corruption, advising ego dissolution and total transparency in life.
</li><li><b>The necessity of transparency to reduce corruption</b>: Leo elucidates that many corrupt thoughts and actions remain hidden because they operate in secrecy; therefore, being transparent in thoughts, words, and actions can significantly reduce corruption.
</li><li><b>Non–judgmental attitude towards others' corruptions</b>: He suggests that assessing others' corruptions harshly is unproductive, as ridding oneself of corruption is immensely challenging and requires lifelong work. Change should begin with oneself before judging others.
</li><li><b>Compassion for people involved in corruption</b>: Leo urges compassion rather than vilification for those who are corrupt, attributing their behavior to unconsciousness, lack of proper education, fear, and survival instincts rather than intrinsic evil.
</li><li><b>Self–compassion in facing personal corruption</b>: He advises against self–hatred for one's own corrupt tendencies, advocating for self–love and acceptance as a means to overcome these challenges and progress towards change.
</li><li><b>Utility of the corruption worksheet</b>: A worksheet is provided for viewers to increase awareness of their own corrupt behaviors and to encourage self–examination and accountability.
</li><li><b>Donations towards combating corruption</b>: Leo encourages American viewers to donate to Wolfpack, a non–profit aiming to end the influence of money in politics, to take concrete action against corruption in American politics.
</li><li><b>Big–picture understanding through Actualized.org</b>: Leo emphasizes the focus of Actualized.org on advanced, abstract topics related to big–picture understanding of reality and life, typically exploring 'being needs' as opposed to basic survival needs.
</li><li><b>Complementing Actualized.org content with basic learning</b>: He suggests supplementing his teachings with more basic information that covers practical survival skills, as his content is aimed toward deeper understanding and long–term personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Long–term timeline for transformation</b>: He cautions against expecting quick fixes from his content, proposing a long–term commitment to his teachings for cumulative effects and deep, transformative understanding over many years.
</li><li><b>Pursuit of infinite understanding</b>: The ultimate goal of Leo's teachings is to guide viewers toward achieving infinite understanding, which he believes can unlock the full potential of life and fundamentally change one's trajectory.
