            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Motivation for Eating Healthy</b>: Leo has significantly improved his diet by exploring different diets, researching nutrition, and focusing on valuing not just the idea of health but the practicality of it.
</li><li><b>Leo's Weight Loss Journey</b>: Leo shares his personal experience of being overweight by 65 pounds and how it took him eight years after losing weight to truly transform his diet from junk food to healthy eating.
</li><li><b>Critical View of Fruits vs. Vegetables</b>: Leo emphasizes that fruits should be consumed in moderation, whereas the bulk of one's diet should ideally consist of green leafy vegetables and other colorful veggies due to their unique nutrients.
</li><li><b>Historical Diet of Ancestors</b>: He points out that our ancestors' diets consisted mainly of vegetables and not the processed foods or grains that are common in today's diets.
</li><li><b>Raw Vegetable Consumption</b>: Leo stresses the importance of consuming vegetables raw or lightly cooked to retain nutrients and avoid the toxins that can lead to diseases.
</li><li><b>Types of Vegetables Shown</b>: He showcases wild arugula, romaine lettuce, sugar snappies, red bell peppers, radishes, tomatoes, all organically sourced, emphasizing the benefits of organic produce.
</li><li><b>Eating Vegetables in Large Quantities</b>: He advocates for the consumption of vegetables in large quantities, using big plates to accommodate them, top counter feelings of hunger due to their low–calorie density. 
</li><li><b>Salad Dressing Recipe</b>: Shares his recipe for a healthy salad dressing made with organic extra virgin olive oil, half a lemon, organic brown mustard, and pink Himalayan sea salt–a natural salt option over white table salt.
</li><li><b>Evolution of Taste Preferences</b>: Leo discusses how taste preferences change over time as one reduces their intake of junk food, developing a taste and appreciation for healthier, less complex flavors of raw vegetables.
</li><li><b>Health Consequences of Unhealthy Eating</b>: He reiterates the negative consequences of poor dietary choices, including an increased risk of diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease, and their impact on life performance.
</li><li><b>Pasture–Raised Eggs</b>: Introduces pasture–raised eggs as a nutritious protein source for the salad, explaining that many people have not experienced eggs from hens that roam freely and consume a natural diet.
</li><li><b>Pasture–Raised Eggs</b>: Pasture–raised eggs come from hens that are allowed to roam outdoors, resulting in nutritionally superior eggs. These eggs have distinct shell texture and a deep orange yolk, indicative of their quality.
</li><li><b>Cost Comparison</b>: Pasture–raised eggs are substantially more expensive than conventional and organic eggs. Leo points out that while the cost is higher, the nutritional value and quality of these eggs justify the price.
</li><li><b>Health Concerns with Conventional Eggs</b>: Conventional eggs usually come from hens fed low–quality diets, leading to poorer nutritional profiles. Leo emphasizes the significant health differences in eggs and hens' diets.
</li><li><b>Leo's Diet Structure</b>: Leo's meal plan is not very calorie–dense due to less physical activity. He supplements his diet with foods like dark chocolate, wild Alaskan smoked salmon, and organic frozen berry desserts.
</li><li><b>Dietary Habits and Comparison</b>: Leo urges viewers to assess their diets in terms of the cooking methods and quality of foods consumed, suggesting that most people's diets are less healthy in comparison with his.
</li><li><b>Transition to Healthier Eating</b>: Adapting to healthier eating requires discipline, awareness, and education. Leo mentions that convenient unhealthy food options are pervasive in society, making the switch challenging.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Dining</b>: Even expensive restaurants often use low–quality ingredients for profit. Leo criticizes the illusion that costly meals are equivalent to healthy eating.
</li><li><b>Health as an Investment for Future Impact</b>: Leo shares his personal motivation for healthy eating focused on longevity, avoiding diseases, maintaining high performance, and fulfilling his life's purpose, especially in his later years.
</li><li><b>Immediate and Future Benefits of Healthy Eating</b>: Healthy eating provides immediate energy benefits as well as long–term health prospects. Leo relates this to his ability to remain productive and achieve his goals.
