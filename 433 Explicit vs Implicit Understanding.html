            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Y9d0tOpL8ZU' target='_blank'>Explicit vs Implicit Understanding</a></h1>
            <p><em>"The nature of reality is such that no matter how much you say about it you<br />
will be no closer to the end than when you began.<br />
Which is why the wise sit in silence"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding vs Knowledge</strong> : Understanding is fundamentally different from knowledge. Knowledge can be a collection of facts while understanding involves an insight into the workings of something, such as how an engine operates. </li>
<li><strong>The Amorphous Nature of Understanding</strong> : Understanding is a mysterious, vague phenomenon that is central to life but often taken for granted. Leo aims to initiate an exploration into the subtleties of understanding by distinguishing between explicit and implicit understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Duality of Explicit vs Implicit</strong> : Understanding has dual forms: explicit, which is clear and fully articulated, and implicit, which is inherent, suggested, or unexpressed. All dualities, including this one, will eventually need to collapse for complete comprehension. </li>
</ul>

<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gJSQcRYx/433-Explicit-vs-Implicit-Understanding-Image-2.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Societal and Scientific Bias</strong> : Society and science are social constructs with inherent biases towards explicit knowledge due to the need for clear communication and consensus. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit Understanding Undervalued</strong> : Implicit aspects of reality are often overlooked because they are tricky to express and are considered less valuable or even unreal by society, adversely affecting the depth of our collective understanding. </li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Explicit and Implicit Truths</strong> : There exist truths in reality that are important and true but cannot be explicitly communicated or shared, posing a challenge for societal learning and advancement. </li>
<li><strong>The Role of Intuition</strong> : Intuition plays a crucial part in our personal development and quest for truth. Honoring and following intuitions are essential even though they might be difficult to articulate. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Nature of Natural Numbers</strong> : Natural numbers (1, 2, 3...) exemplify the idea of implicit understanding&mdash;as you can't explicitly list an infinite set, yet you understand its endless nature, a realization that borders on being mystical. </li>
<li><strong>The Mysticism in Grasping Infinity</strong> : Understanding the infinite nature of natural numbers represents a form of implicit knowing, mystical in its essence, as it is a holistic grasp of a concept that cannot be concretely demonstrated. </li>
<li><strong>Transcendental Numbers and Pi</strong> : Transcendental numbers like Pi show that despite comprehensively knowing many decimal points, one cannot explicitly describe Pi in its entirety, as highlighted by Ferdinand von Lindemann's work that proved its nature whilst using finite symbols. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3hXh114/433-Explicit-vs-Implicit-Understanding-Image-3.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pi as a Transcendental Number</strong> : Pi, an infinite, transcendental number, challenges the concept of finitude, as Leo highlights the conundrum of proving its endless nature using finite means. </li>
<li><strong>Explicating Physical Objects</strong> : Leo argues that explicit descriptions of objects, like a coffee cup, are fundamentally limitless. Every physical trait and component, down to the quantum level, can be endlessly detailed, revealing the implicit infinite nature of objects. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Materialism Critique</strong> : The scientific assumption that reality has a finite, explicit bottom is critiqued. Leo labels this as fantasy and advocates for the recognition of reality's infinite and implicit facets. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness of Infinity</strong> : Direct consciousness or intuition can grasp the infinite depth of objects, similar to the understanding of natural numbers. Leo suggests that special practices, like meditation or psychedelics, can provoke an awareness of reality's limitless nature. </li>
<li><strong>Limits of Science</strong> : Leo underscores that the scientific method is incapable of fully explicating reality. He asserts that some aspects of reality can only be understood implicitly, beyond the tools and scope of science. </li>
<li><strong>Essence of Jokes</strong> : The humor in jokes relies on an implicit twist that the mind grasps intuitively. Over-explaining a joke destroys its essence, exemplifying how overt explicitness can miss fundamental subtleties. </li>
<li><strong>Flirtation and Subcommunication</strong> : Successful flirtation depends on subtlety and implicit communication. Over-explicitness ruins the delicate dance of flirtation, demonstrating the importance of intuition and implicit understanding in human interactions. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit Communication and Attraction</strong> : Leo discusses the implicit nature of attraction; successful flirtation involves conveying messages beyond what is explicitly said, highlighting the importance of subtlety. </li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding Explicit and Implicit Reality</strong> : The expectation to fully explicate reality leads to misunderstanding its nature. Understanding that reality is primarily implicit can adjust expectations and foster a deeper comprehension. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite Exploration of Reality</strong> : Scientific exploration, while valuable, is bound to an endless task if it seeks to explicate all reality. Leo advises that recognizing the perpetual implicit nature of reality is a more truthful approach. </li>
<li><strong>Subcommunication in attraction</strong> : Successful attraction relies more on subconscious cues like body language, eye contact, confidence, and the manner of approach, rather than explicit lines or words. </li>
<li><strong>Authentic masculinity</strong> : Women intuitively perceive honest signals of masculine energy. Being a genuinely confident and expressive man is more attractive than any line or facade. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation for attraction</strong> : Men need to develop themselves genuinely to exude the authentic signals that naturally attract women, rather than relying on tricks or manipulation. </li>
<li><strong>Intuition in women</strong> : Women have honed intuition to discern genuine men from imposters, due to historical pressures of being misled, and thus they rely on implicit signals rather than explicit words. </li>
<li><strong>Men&#39;s explicit nature vs. women&#39;s implicit nature</strong> : Men often expect explicit communication, while women operate on a more intuitive, implicit level, which can lead to misunderstandings in relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Reading between the lines in relationships</strong> : To improve relationships with women, men need to learn to understand and communicate on an implicit level, tuning into unspoken cues and emotions. </li>
<li><strong>Storytelling in movies</strong> : Great writers convey plot and emotion implicitly through actions and visual cues rather than solely through explicit dialogue. </li>
<li><strong>Gödel&#39;s incompleteness theorem and logic</strong> : Gödel proved that logical systems are incomplete and can't encompass all truths; there are always meta-truths that resist encapsulation in any logical framework. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation and non-thinking</strong> : Stopping the 'monkey mind' in meditation can't be achieved through explicit thought processes; it requires an implicit grasp of a non-thinking approach to life. </li>
<li><strong>Reading between the lines in literature</strong> : Writers leave room for interpretation between the explicit lines, and absolute explicitness is impossible since readers can always infer additional meaning. </li>
<li><strong>Paradox of honesty</strong> : Asking someone directly if they are honest is ineffective, as honesty is an implicit, meta-level concept that cannot be explicitly proven within the conversation itself. </li>
<li><strong>Honest Signaling</strong> : Communication in human interaction relies on honest signals, which are difficult to fake. Words are easier to misrepresent, which is not a flaw of reality but deeply ingrained in its epistemology. </li>
<li><strong>Reading Between the Lines</strong> : An explicit approach misses the essence of spirituality and mysticism found in religious texts. These communicate in an implicit, transcendent way that cannot be captured through literal interpretation. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit Understanding in Spiritual Teachings</strong> : Spiritual teachings are intended to be guides pointing towards an implicit and transcendent truth, requiring personal realization and intuition to truly comprehend. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit Nature of Understanding</strong> : All understanding has implicit elements; explicit explanation alone cannot make someone understand if they lack the intuitive capacity for 'grokking' the concept. </li>
<li><strong>The Leap in Consciousness</strong> : Comprehending basic mathematical concepts like 'one plus one equals two' represents an intuitive leap in consciousness that is taken for granted but may not be self-evident to everyone. </li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Proofs and Intuition</strong> : Mathematics, often perceived as objective truth, fundamentally relies on personal, intuitive understanding; without it, proofs would be meaningless. </li>
<li><strong>Recognition and Mystical Insight</strong> : Recognizing oneself in a mirror is not a scientific process but an intuitive and immediate insight, similar to a mystical experience, taken for granted by humans but not attainable by all species. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding God</strong> : Understanding God as everything and oneself as God is an implicit realization, eluding explicit explanation. Grokking this concept is essential but can take variable time for different individuals. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit vs. Explicit in Workshops</strong> : Using a workshop example, it was demonstrated that even pointing is a relative act of communication dependent on the projection of meaning onto symbols&mdash;a fundamental concept in the understanding of language. </li>
<li><strong>Transcendental Nature of Reality</strong> : Reality is described as transcendental and cannot be fully explicated, highlighting an unending process where more will always remain implicit regardless of how much is explained. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Absolute Infinity vs. Numerical Infinity</strong> : The universe's totality is an "absolute infinity," encompassing an endless variety of existences and truths beyond just the "numerical infinity" of counting or measuring. </li>
<li><strong>Numerical vs. Absolute Infinity</strong> : Numerical infinity is just one instance within the broader concept of absolute infinity. Absolute infinity encapsulates everything, including the observable universe, and is present here and now. </li>
<li><strong>Irreducibly Implicit Truths</strong> : The deepest truths and understandings are inherently implicit, requiring intuition and consciousness. They can't be articulated fully, broken down into steps, or formally proven. This is a strength, as it allows reality to be endlessly fascinating and inexhaustible. </li>
<li><strong>The Endlessness of Reality</strong> : Reality's infinite nature is not a limitation but an aspect that ensures its boundless exploration. Despite reality being unknowable in totality, one can grasp its endlessness similarly to understanding the infinite nature of numbers without counting every single one. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Infinity Without Complete Explication</strong> : The human mind is capable of holistically understanding the concept of infinity without needing to detail each step. Insisting on explication for everything is a self-imposed limitation, hindering one's ability to comprehend infinity. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Explication</strong> : Words and symbols are finite and second-order, unable to fully capture truth, which is first-order and infinite. Expecting total explication is a handicap, and realizing the limits of communication is crucial for deeper reality exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Synthesis of Science and Mysticism</strong> : The future of deep reality exploration may lie in the synthesis of the explicit approach of science and the implicit approach of mysticism, which are complementary and necessary to understand reality comprehensively. </li>
<li><strong>List of Inexplicable Entities</strong> : Truth, absolute consciousness, and God are some of the elements of reality that cannot be explicated. Implicit experiences like love, intuition, and mystical experiences also elude complete explication. </li>
<li><strong>Examples of Implicit Knowledge</strong> : Understanding abstract concepts such as Zen and the intrinsic motivations in life are examples of implicit knowledge - they cannot be explained in words but are understood through experience. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Takeaways</strong> : Acknowledge the implicit nature of reality and stop demanding complete explication. Learn the value of silence and wisdom, rely more on intuition, and trust personal visions without necessarily justifying them to others. </li>
<li><strong>Cultivating Personal Visions</strong> : Visions for one's life should be trusted and cultivated intuitively rather than proven scientifically; visions are implicit, forming internally before manifesting explicitly. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Intuition and Abstraction</strong> : It's important to develop skills in abstract thinking and intuition to understand various aspects of life, such as relationships, health, business, and spiritual teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Reading Between the Lines</strong> : The ability to infer implicit meanings in communication is vital for leadership, relationships, and personal development. It offers a deeper comprehension of situations. </li>
<li><strong>Communication Gaps and Translation Loss</strong> : Accept that communication inherently has limitations, and there's often a loss in translation which requires an understanding beyond the explicitly stated. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Proof Requirement</strong> : Many aspects of reality cannot be proven but are still true; understanding this nature of reality is essential, just as recognizing that not everything can be or needs to be proven to others. </li>
<li><strong>Accepting Others' Inability to Understand</strong> : Recognizing that some people may not grasp certain concepts is crucial, and persistence in trying to prove these can be counterproductive and unhelpful. </li>
<li><strong>Laying the Foundation for Vision Logic and Post Rationality</strong> : The discussion around understanding and abstraction lays the groundwork for vision logic or post-rationality&mdash;a transcendental way of thinking that combines logic with intuition. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing Implicit and Transcendent Logic</strong> : Vision logic acknowledges implicit and transcendent aspects of reality, creating a 'fuzzy logic' approach to understanding that extends beyond strict rationality. </li>
<li><strong>Contemplating the Nature of Understanding</strong> : One should reflect on the process of understanding itself, as well as on misunderstandings, as a way to roundaboutly comprehend the essence of understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Balance of Interpretation</strong> : Care must be taken not to misinterpret teachings by being overly literal or by projecting personal biases when trying to read between the lines. </li>
<li><strong>Complementary Abstraction Episode</strong> : An upcoming episode will delve more deeply into abstraction, which is crucial for grasping the implicit aspects of reality and will build upon the foundation laid here. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Projections of Meaning</strong> : Not everything conveys a deeper meaning; meanings are often projected by the mind. It's significant to differentiate between the essence of teachings and personal interpretations. </li>
<li><strong>Art of Reading Spiritual Teachings</strong> : Applying spiritual teachings correctly requires understanding the intended essence by the teacher&mdash;not a verbatim recitation but an insightful interpretation.</li>
