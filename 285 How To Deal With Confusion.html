            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/lRipeQ_lcN8' target='_blank'>How To Deal With Confusion</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Creation</strong> : Leo clarifies that understanding is not inherent at birth but is a construct that needs to be actively developed throughout life, and this path of self-actualization includes building an understanding across various life domains. </li>
<li><strong>Nature of Confusion</strong> : Confusion arises when the mind faces uncertainty and tries to reconcile conflicting ideas, leading to discomfort as most people are wired for certainty and order, resulting in knee-jerk reactions aimed at eliminating confusion quickly. </li>
<li><strong>Developing Emotional Tolerance</strong> : Leo emphasizes the need to develop an emotional tolerance for confusion and uncertainty, a trait commonly found in self-actualized individuals who are comfortable with ambiguity and paradox. </li>
<li><strong>Five-Step Process for Embracing Confusion</strong> : Leo introduces a simple, five-step process to engage with confusion: 1) Cultivating awareness of confusion, 2) Labeling the confusion, 3) Facing confusion by inquiring into its origins, 4) Allowing confusion without resistance, 5) Embracing a state of not knowing. </li>
<li><strong>The Harm of Premature Resolution</strong> : The compulsion to resolve confusion immediately can lead to a mechanical and rigid mindset, often resulting in a false sense of understanding and obstructing true personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Honesty with Uncertainty</strong> : Admitting to oneself that there is a lack of understanding in areas of confusion is crucial, and can be uncovered through honest self-inquiry, ultimately leading to genuine clarity. </li>
<li><strong>Surrendering the need to know</strong> : To embrace a state of not-knowing, ask yourself if you can let go of the need to have immediate answers. This surrendering process goes against the cultural conditioning that values certainty and decisiveness, but it&#39;s essential for genuine understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Applying the five-step process to enlightenment work</strong> : While engaged in self-inquiry to understand concepts like "Who am I?" or enlightenment, embrace confusion when nothing seems to click. Acknowledging the confusion rather than ignoring it allows for a deeper exploration of the self. </li>
<li><strong>Confusion in practical decision-making</strong> : Confusion is not limited to spiritual pursuits; it affects practical decisions like career choices and life purposes. Instead of paralysis, acknowledge the confusion and allow answers to unfold organically without forcing them. </li>
<li><strong>Objection handling regarding ignorance</strong> : Embracing confusion does not lead to ignorance. Ignorance is rooted in ignoring what you don't know and having a false sense of certainty. Openness to not knowing prevents ignorance and positions you for insights and intellectual growth. </li>
<li><strong>Revelation through embracing confusion</strong> : Instead of pushing for answers, being open to confusion sets the stage for profound revelations to come organically. This requires patience and tolerance for uncertainty but results in deeper and more authentic insights. </li>
<li><strong>Allowing for nature-derived insights</strong> : Embracing confusion allows for insights that come from a place beyond the ego, often more profound and true. Such insights are richer and more fulfilling than ego-driven, shallow realizations. </li>
<li><strong>The illusion of adamant answer seeking</strong> : Forcing answers can seem effective but often leads to low-quality insights. A high need for certainty can make you emotionally unstable, defensive, and ideologically rigid, which stifles personal growth and limits deeper understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Intuition versus over-reliance on logic</strong> : Excessive need for resolution suppresses intuition and creativity. Embracing confusion allows for a more balanced approach, leveraging both logic and intuition to explore the mysteries of reality and create a high-quality life. </li>
<li><strong>Power of Intuition vs. Logical Reasoning</strong> : Leo highlights how intuition is a significantly more powerful tool than logical thinking, especially when dealing with profound life questions and insights. </li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Confusion for Deep Insights</strong> : Emphasizing that the most profound insights arise from tolerating extended periods of confusion, Leo points out that many individuals miss out on these insights because they are not willing to endure the necessary confusion. </li>
<li><strong>Research and Tolerance for Confusion</strong> : Leo shares his personal approach to researching various topics, from enlightenment to business, and how having a high tolerance for confusion allows him to explore these subjects deeply, fitting together pieces of a complex jigsaw puzzle. </li>
<li><strong>Impacts of Confusion on Self-Help Engagement</strong> : Acknowledging that an overwhelming amount of information can lead to paralysis, Leo warns against quitting or doubting the efficacy of self-help material due to confusion and instead advocates pushing forward with patience. </li>
<li><strong>Stuck in Decision-Making Due to Fear of Confusion</strong> : Leo examines how individuals may prematurely abandon pursuits like determining life purposes, because they are unable to decide in the face of confusion and instead should trust in eventual reconciliation. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Tolerance for Confusion in Meditation and Enlightenment</strong> : Sharing a personal anecdote, Leo recounts advice from a Zen master about letting go of the need to know and realizes the significance of accepting confusion in quality meditation and enlightenment practices. </li>
<li><strong>Surrendering to Not-Knowing in Enlightenment</strong> : Leo emphasizes the need to surrender to uncertainty and accept being confused, a challenge he faced during his meditation retreat as he sought enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Zen Tradition and Embracing Confusion</strong> : Discussing the Zen practice of working on Koans, Leo illustrates the value placed on confusion by Zen masters who avoid giving answers directly, encouraging students to accept and get comfortable with their confusion. </li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learning and Discovery Process</strong> : Leo urges viewers to continuously embrace confusion as part of an ongoing process of learning and discovery, which does not end even after achieving enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Applying Philosophy to Daily Life</strong> : Leo invites his audience to recognize moments of confusion in their daily lives and consciously face them rather than avoiding the discomfort. </li>
<li><strong>Teasing Future Content for Actualized.org</strong> : Leo concludes by sharing his excitement about future content, teasing powerful transformation techniques and a big-picture understanding of life and reality he plans to offer through Actualized.org.</li>
