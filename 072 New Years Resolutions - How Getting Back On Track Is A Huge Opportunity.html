            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-PuRL9LCF4w' target='_blank'>New Years Resolutions - How Getting Back On Track Is A Huge Opportunity</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Setting ambitious New Year's resolutions</strong> : Leo has set a notably ambitious resolution to create one video daily throughout 2014, which he admits is extremely challenging but aims to try for it regardless. </li>
<li><strong>Adaptability in goal pursuit</strong> : Leo acknowledges that it might not be possible to literally meet the daily goal, so he adjusts his plan to still aim for a total of 365 videos in the year, even if it means sometimes producing more on one day and less on another. </li>
<li><strong>Value of a daily habit</strong> : While adjusting plans, Leo still sees significance in attempting to maintain a daily ritual of creating content, though he missed a day, he doesn't consider it a major setback due to the ambitious nature of his goal. </li>
<li><strong>Getting back on track as a key opportunity</strong> : Leo discusses the importance of resuming progress after a minor failure, using his own example of not shooting a video one day. He stresses resuming immediately rather than focusing on perfection. </li>
<li><strong>Long-term perspective in goal setting</strong> : He emphasizes the importance of thinking long-term and being strategic, adaptable, and forward-thinking. Slipping once should not deter one from their long-term goals, much like a golfer does not quit after a bad stroke. </li>
<li><strong>Optimalist mindset over perfectionist mindset</strong> : Leo encourages adopting an 'optimalist' mindset rather than a perfectionist one. He believes strategic, adaptable thinking helps in continuing to make progress, despite inevitable setbacks. </li>
<li><strong>Ambition vs. practical outcome</strong> : He argues that it is better to set ambitious goals and achieve a substantial part of them, like 90%, rather than setting modest goals and achieving 100%. He relates this to the success of a business or personal fitness goals. </li>
<li><strong>Risk of aiming for 100% perfection</strong> : Leo suggests that aiming for perfection can lead to disappointment and discouragement while aiming for a realistic goal like 90% can lead to satisfaction and continued improvement. </li>
<li><strong>The danger of quitting</strong> : He identifies quitting as the ultimate failure in any endeavor. Consistent effort, even with occasional failings, will lead to improvement over time, whereas quitting halts all progress. </li>
<li><strong>Continued progress despite setbacks</strong> : Leo concludes by inspiring viewers to stay on track with their resolutions, stressing that getting right back on track after veering off course is crucial to long-term success.</li>
