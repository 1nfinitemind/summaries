            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-PuRL9LCF4w' target='_blank'>New Years Resolutions - How Getting Back On Track Is A Huge Opportunity</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Setting ambitious New Year's resolutions</b>: Leo has set a notably ambitious resolution to create one video daily throughout 2014, which he admits is extremely challenging but aims to try for it regardless.
</li><li><b>Adaptability in goal pursuit</b>: Leo acknowledges that it might not be possible to literally meet the daily goal, so he adjusts his plan to still aim for a total of 365 videos in the year, even if it means sometimes producing more on one day and less on another.
</li><li><b>Value of a daily habit</b>: While adjusting plans, Leo still sees significance in attempting to maintain a daily ritual of creating content, though he missed a day, he doesn't consider it a major setback due to the ambitious nature of his goal.
</li><li><b>Getting back on track as a key opportunity</b>: Leo discusses the importance of resuming progress after a minor failure, using his own example of not shooting a video one day. He stresses resuming immediately rather than focusing on perfection.
</li><li><b>Long–term perspective in goal setting</b>: He emphasizes the importance of thinking long–term and being strategic, adaptable, and forward–thinking. Slipping once should not deter one from their long–term goals, much like a golfer does not quit after a bad stroke.
</li><li><b>Optimalist mindset over perfectionist mindset</b>: Leo encourages adopting an 'optimalist' mindset rather than a perfectionist one. He believes strategic, adaptable thinking helps in continuing to make progress, despite inevitable setbacks.
</li><li><b>Ambition vs. practical outcome</b>: He argues that it is better to set ambitious goals and achieve a substantial part of them, like 90%, rather than setting modest goals and achieving 100%. He relates this to the success of a business or personal fitness goals.
</li><li><b>Risk of aiming for 100% perfection</b>: Leo suggests that aiming for perfection can lead to disappointment and discouragement, while aiming for a realistic goal like 90% can lead to satisfaction and continued improvement.
</li><li><b>The danger of quitting</b>: He identifies quitting as the ultimate failure in any endeavor. Consistent effort, even with occasional failings, will lead to improvement over time, whereas quitting halts all progress.
</li><li><b>Continued progress despite setbacks</b>: Leo concludes by inspiring viewers to stay on track with their resolutions, stressing that getting right back on track after veering off course is crucial to long–term success.
