<li><strong>Leo's career transition journey</strong> : Leo recounts his own experience, emphasizing the weight of the decision to leave his job as a video game designer to pursue his own business. He highlights the sense of being at a life crossroads, feeling the risk, and not knowing how things will turn out. </li>
<li><strong>Clarity in life decisions</strong> : Stressing the importance of clarity in what you want from life, Leo suggests it reduces uncertainty in difficult choices. Identifying top values is a tool he recommends for easing such decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Values and career alignment</strong> : Determining how well a current career aligns with personal values against a potential new career is a method Leo advises to help make career transition decisions. </li>
<li><strong>Life purpose and motivation for change</strong> : Leo points out that unsatisfactory lifestyle from a job or a lack of passion may motivate a career shift. Not honoring one's values in the current role can lead to resistance and dissatisfaction. </li>
<li><strong>Pain signals from subconscious</strong> : The discomfort felt when one's job does not honor their values is seen as a subconscious cue that change is necessary for alignment with personal significance. </li>
<li><strong>Job satisfaction's impact on life</strong> : Leo highlights the importance of job satisfaction as a major component of waking hours, influencing overall life satisfaction. </li>
<li><strong>Weighing costs against long-term benefits</strong> : Initial costs of a career change, such as time spent unemployed, are countered by potential long-term benefits like fulfillment and income increase. </li>
<li><strong>Passion's tangible impact</strong> : Passion in work, according to Leo, translates into tangible benefits like better interactions, higher enthusiasm, and ultimately, greater value creation that could lead to higher earning potential. </li>
<li><strong>Overcoming skepticism and fear</strong> : Leo recognizes that pessimism and fear can obstruct career transition, but he encourages facing them to live according to one's values rather than settling for mediocrity. </li>
<li><strong>Transition strategy</strong> : A gradual approach to changing careers is proposed, starting a new path while maintaining financial stability through the current job until a smooth transition can be assured. </li>
<li><strong>Research and training's importance</strong> : Engaging in a self-discovery process, researching, and acquiring necessary training for a new career path are crucial steps Leo urges for those looking to change careers. </li>
<li><strong>Current job as a stepping stone</strong> : He suggests using the benefits of a current job, such as financial stability, to support yourself while preparing for a future career. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement with audience for support</strong> : Leo encourages interaction through comments, likes, and shares. He directs viewers to his website for more advanced strategies and promises additional resources through his newsletter.</li>
