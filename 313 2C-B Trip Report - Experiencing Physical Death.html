            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/9_WL0hoRA7s' target='_blank'>2C-B Trip Report - Experiencing Physical Death</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding of 2C–B</b>: Leo explains that 2C–B is a phenethylamine psychedelic, often used recreationally at parties. Unlike tryptamines like DMT or mushrooms, 2C–B is supposed to be more visual and less mind–altering, with a lower 'mindfuck' component, meaning it doesn't deeply challenge one's perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Rectal Administration of 2C–B</b>: Opting for rectal administration, Leo takes 10 milligrams of 2C–B, which he describes as efficient, cost–effective, and capable of causing fast onset of effects. This method also reduces issues like nausea and the need for fasting before consumption.
</li><li><b>Onset of the Trip</b>: Shortly after taking 2C–B, Leo feels an undefinable strangeness and notices a change in the physical sensation of his body, described as 'body load'. Feeling somewhat anesthetized, he takes ginger pills to alleviate the slight onset of nausea.
</li><li><b>Visuals and Introspection</b>: As the trip progresses, visual anomalies like colors and patterns commonly associated with psychedelics start appearing. Leo becomes increasingly introspective, delving into existential questions about the nature of consciousness, reality, Brahman, and God, while observing hypnotic visuals.
</li><li><b>Concept of 'Groundlessness'</b>: During his experience, Leo confronts the idea of groundlessness, the realization that all known surfaces within reality have no ultimate grounding and that this continues indefinitely. This insight is described as beautiful and profound, so much so that it's beyond mere emotion and leaves him sobered by its depth.
</li><li><b>Surrendering to the Experience</b>: Leo surrenders to the experience, abandoning his meta–awareness and the usual note–taking process for later reflection or teaching. He recognizes he is past the point of no return, with the line between physical and non–physical dissolving, and is entranced by the beauty of the existential truths revealed.
</li><li><b>Distinction between physical and mental</b>: Leo challenges the conventional distinction between the physical body and the mental aspects of the self. He asserts that in a heightened state of consciousness, the paradigm of a physical body collapses since what we consider physical is actually just surfaces within consciousness.
</li><li><b>Paradigm breakdown during 'physical' ego death</b>: During his experience, Leo's perception of having a physical body disintegrated, leading to a breakdown in his entire sense of reality. This felt akin to physically dying, which he describes using the analogy of bleeding out after being shot and the body and mind preparing for the end.
</li><li><b>Preparation for the end</b>: Leo narrates how, while expecting to die, he began to reflect upon his life as if confronting his creator, preparing for the inevitable end. This retrospective review of life is typical of an actual physical dying process where one faces their life's events, regrets, and their ultimate meaning.
</li><li><b>Complete surrender to the experience of death</b>: Leo expresses a deep state of acceptance and surrender to the experience of dying, claiming to feel ready to die due to the overwhelming beauty of the experience, indicating a complete ego death from his perspective.
</li><li><b>Realization through open–mindedness</b>: He reflects on his entire life journey, from childhood curiosity to philosophical education to his work with Actualized.org, and concludes that his constant pursuit of increased open–mindedness led to this moment of experiencing his own physical death.
</li><li><b>Moment of physical ego death</b>: Leo describes the moment of 'death' as the sensation of his self supernovaing and dissipating into reality, a moment where his self, both the personal identity and the physical sense, is completely gone, leaving only the universal existence.
</li><li><b>Death experience as a relief and joy</b>: Post–'death', Leo describes feeling an immense sense of relief, peace, and joy–as if all burdens were lifted. He likens this post–death liberation as the greatest possible experience for a living being, feeling immortal and untouchable.
</li><li><b>Reemergence after 'death'</b>: After experiencing 'death', Leo re–emerges with a changed perspective, no longer feeling his ego, but instead feeling part of the universe. He uses the story of the Buddha to illustrate the feeling of universal applause for confronting and overcoming death.
</li><li><b>Altered perception of physical reality</b>: Returning to his body, Leo no longer perceives things as physical objects; his hands and the coffee table are seen as manifestations within a field of consciousness with no boundaries, all made of the same 'substance'–consciousness.
</li><li><b>The residual effect of the trip</b>: Although the most intense effects have subsided, Leo continues to feel anesthetized and marvels at his altered perspective for hours after, reflecting on the entire experience as profound, enlightening, and devoid of fear or resistance.
</li><li><b>Post–Peak Trip Experience</b>: After the peak, Leo's trip continues without significant new developments. He spends time walking outdoors, observing his surroundings with a fresh yet numbed perspective, contemplating the profound experiences he'd had earlier.
</li><li><b>Integration of Experience</b>: During the lingering effects of 2C–B, which last nearly 12 hours, Leo meditates and ponders the significance of what he underwent–reflecting on existence and the nature of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Lessons on Psychedelic Depth</b>: Leo highlights that the depth of a psychedelic experience is influenced more by the user's preparation, intent, seriousness, and receptiveness to existential shifts, rather than by the substance or dosage alone.
</li><li><b>Diet and Mindfulness Practices</b>: He credits his plant–based diet, mindfulness exercises, and consistent neurofeedback brain training for contributing to the richness of his psychedelic experiences.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic Journeys as a Progressive Arc</b>: Leo discusses how psychedelic trips are not isolated incidents but part of a spiritual journey. This progression takes someone through understanding and confronting inner fears, leading to increasingly profound insights.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as Physical Death</b>: He shares the insight that enlightenment manifests as a form of physical death, where the boundary between physical and non–physical dissolves, and one becomes the universe itself.
</li><li><b>Positive Reinterpretation of Death</b>: Leo's trip transformed his perception of physical death into a desirable and positive transformation, akin to a grand finale rather than an end to be feared.
</li><li><b>Various Degrees of Surrender and Ego Death</b>: Leo talks about encountering various degrees of surrender and ego death throughout his psychedelic experiences, culminating in a trip that felt like a complete physical death.
</li><li><b>Temporary Nature of Psychedelic Enlightenment</b>: He addresses the criticism of psychedelics' temporary enlightenment by asserting that these experiences have a transformative potential that extends beyond the trip itself.
</li><li><b>Continued Growth and Spiritual Effort</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for ongoing spiritual work and contemplation to fully integrate the insights gained from psychedelic experiences.
</li><li><b>Future Content Teaser</b>: The segment concludes with Leo mentioning a detailed written trip report that may be published for those interested in the finer aspects of his experience, and he promotes his website and future content for his audience.
