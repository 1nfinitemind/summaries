            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XulpS3cAkOM' target='_blank'>How You Lie - All Your Dirty, Sneaky Lies & Manipulations Exposed!</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Foundational Concepts for Self–Actualization</b>: Leo states that understanding one's own tendency to lie, manipulate, and engage in self–deception is crucial for personal growth and self–actualization.
</li><li><b>Warning of Disturbing Revelations</b>: He warns that the forthcoming revelations about self–deception may be shocking but are ultimately beneficial for long–term development.
</li><li><b>Self–deception as Life's Central Theme</b>: Leo positions self–deception as a central theme in life, significantly affecting all areas where success and results are pursued, and is a major obstacle to personal growth.
</li><li><b>Introduction of the "Self–Agenda" Concept</b>: The self–agenda, a concept Leo learned from Peter Ralston, drives our actions and is focused on preserving our self–image rather than our physical survival or wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Truth vs. Self–Survival</b>: The primary operating principle in life is not truth, but self–survival, with most people prioritizing the preservation of their self–image or self–concept.
</li><li><b>Seeking Comfort and Certainty</b>: Leo argues that people primarily seek comfort and certainty rather than truth, even when they claim to act out of love or altruism.
</li><li><b>Protecting the Ego</b>: All actions, even seemingly self–destructive ones, are directed towards protecting and maintaining one's self–image or ego.
</li><li><b>Low Awareness as a Defense Mechanism</b>: Low awareness protects the ego by shielding individuals from facing the painful reality of their self–deceptions and lies.
</li><li><b>High Awareness Requires Responsibility</b>: Gaining higher awareness involves confronting the lies one has lived by and is a challenging process that may stir cognitive dissonance by challenging one's identity.
</li><li><b>Self–Deception Through Lack of Awareness</b>: The mind is wired for self–deception; lying to oneself effectively serves the self–agenda, as the very concept of the 'self' is a lie.
</li><li><b>The Ego as a Fabrication</b>: Leo explains that one's entire identity and the understanding of reality are fabrications created by the mind, sustained through low consciousness.
</li><li><b>Evolution's Role in Self–Deception</b>: The human propensity for self–deception is tied to survival and evolutionary mechanisms that prompt organisms to value their well–being above others.
</li><li><b>Lying to Uphold a False Sense of Specialness</b>: The idea that our lives and those close to us are more important than others is identified as a fundamental lie driven by ego and survival needs.
</li><li><b>Survival vs. Truth</b>: Leo suggests that survival/reproduction interests and the pursuit of truth are often at odds, leading to a dilemma where one might have to choose between self–preservation and honesty.
</li><li><b>Self–Image as Truth Defender</b>: He points out that some people perceive themselves as champions of truth, but living true to this self–image is extremely challenging unless they abandon their self–image entirely.
</li><li><b>Early Onset of Lying</b>: Leo explains that lying starts at a very young age, becoming so habitual that it is like a fish not realizing it's in water; people become unaware of their constant lying.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Lying</b>: He lists numerous negative physical and mental health outcomes–from stress and anger to heart attacks and suicide–claiming these are often consequences of living a life filled with lies.
</li><li><b>Subtlety of Lying</b>: Leo asserts most lying is not overt but subtle and unconscious, which makes it particularly insidious and a manifestation of low consciousness.
</li><li><b>Examples of Subtle Lies</b>: He catalogues various forms of deceptive behaviors, from fake smiles and politeness to withholding important information and pretending to be more spiritual or compassionate than one really is.
</li><li><b>Hypocrisy in Self–Professed Virtues</b>: Leo criticizes those who claim to be spiritual, loving, or altruistic as often being the most deceptive and selfish, using their 'virtues' as a smokescreen for ulterior motives.
</li><li><b>Manipulation in Relationships</b>: He describes the extensive use of manipulation and subtle lies within intimate relationships to avoid conflict or to influence partners' behaviors.
</li><li><b>Lies Stemming from Self–Agenda</b>: Leo reiterates that many lies derive from protecting one's self–image and agenda, which ultimately backfire and reduce the quality of life.
</li><li><b>Cultural dishonesty about sex</b>: Leo criticizes society's false modesty about sexual behavior, stating that many people lie to themselves about their sexual activities and desires to maintain a "good" image.
</li><li><b>Deception in marketing and sales</b>: He points out that professionals in marketing and sales often lie and manipulate consumers through deceptive advertising tactics and urgency to make sales.
</li><li><b>Withholding information in leadership</b>: Leo emphasizes that leaders, bosses, and CEOs frequently withhold crucial information from their teams for self–serving reasons, not respecting the principle of truth.
</li><li><b>Reluctance to admit mistakes</b>: People often refuse to acknowledge their errors and concoct excuses to maintain their self–image instead of admitting they were wrong.
</li><li><b>Hiding weaknesses and insecurities</b>: Leo highlights the common practice of hiding personal flaws and insecurities to appear confident and put together, which is often exaggerated during dating.
</li><li><b>Failure to express emotions</b>: Many individuals suppress their emotions, such as anger or sadness, and lie about their well–being by claiming they are "fine" instead of sharing their true feelings.
</li><li><b>Watering down opinions</b>: He discusses how people often soften their opinion in social settings as a way of avoiding conflict and protecting their self–image.
</li><li><b>Manipulative use of humor and sarcasm</b>: According to Leo, humor and sarcasm can be used to manipulate, belittle, and divert attention from true intentions or real issues.
</li><li><b>Secret scheming for self–preservation</b>: Leo mentions that in situations like anticipated layoffs, individuals will secretly plan to avoid personal loss, often at the expense of others.
</li><li><b>Seeking validation through deceptive niceness</b>: He criticizes people who behave nicely just to receive validation, approval, and love from others, viewing it as a form of manipulation.
</li><li><b>Pretense of not being hurt</b>: People often pretend they aren't physically or emotionally hurt to appear strong, which is a self–image preservation tactic.
</li><li><b>Indirect ways of expressing desires</b>: Leo points out how individuals express desires and emotions in covert ways to maintain a humble self–image, like showing off new possessions subtly.
</li><li><b>Unawareness of personal hypocrisy</b>: He argues that most people are not conscious of their hypocrisy, giving the example of holding in one's stomach to appear thinner as a self–deception lie.
</li><li><b>Solution to lying and self–deception</b>: Leo suggests becoming mindful of one's lies, manipulations, and self–deceit and advocates for truth–telling, especially when it has personal costs. He explains the three levels of truth–telling: being honest with oneself, communicating facts honestly, and expressing one's emotions truthfully.
</li><li><b>Self–Agenda vs. Truth</b>: Leo highlights that people primarily care about their self–agenda and self–image over the truth, and stresses that only through extensive work on oneself can this prioritization change.
</li><li><b>Levels of Communicating Truth</b>: Leo describes three levels of truth communication: level one is noticing one's self–agenda, level two involves accurately reporting facts regardless of consequences, and level three is about expressing emotions related to the facts.
</li><li><b>Service to Truth</b>: Gura argues that genuinely serving truth through communication and behavior is emotionally difficult, which discourages most people from doing it, but it is essential for personal integrity and life quality improvement.
</li><li><b>Integrity Issues</b>: Lying and manipulating, Leo contends, harm personal integrity and, by extension, the individual's mental and emotional well–being, leading to depression, stress, and physical health problems.
</li><li><b>Embracing the Consequences of Truth</b>: He warns that truthful communication can have serious consequences, but fears are often overblown, and that in reality, honesty can lead to a more appreciated and refreshing life experience for yourself and others.
</li><li><b>Practical Mindfulness Exercise</b>: Leo suggests wearing a colorful rubber band as a reminder to stay conscious of manipulations, lies, and self–agenda in daily life, to prevent slipping back into unconscious deception.
</li><li><b>Supporting Actualized.org</b>: Leo encourages the audience to support the platform by engaging with the content, signing up for the newsletter, and delving into the deep, transformative material provided.
