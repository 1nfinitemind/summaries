</li><li><b>Leo's tough legal battle</b>: Leo fights a legal battle in Toronto without a lawyer, representing himself against an old client who owes him $23,000 and is counter–suing for $55,000. Additionally, he suffers a car accident, exacerbating the situation.
</li><li><b>Emotional triggers and killer instinct</b>: The intense situation reignites Leo's old fears and emotional triggers about money from his childhood. He experiences a do–or–die mentality, tapping into a survivalist killer instinct as he argues in court, reminiscent of his past challenges.

He empathizes with their struggles to rise up from 'level zero' and overcome obstacles in various areas of their lives.

</li><li><b>The Return to a Passionate Life</b>: He advocates for reigniting a sense of passion and intensity in life, marrying lofty goals with a 'killer instinct' from the past, to overcome lethargy and regain a zest for living an extraordinary life.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Trust in Bigger Possibilities</b>: Leo urges viewers to persevere through tough situations with the belief that there is something greater ahead, sharing his recent experience in court to illustrate the power of a resilient, do–or–die approach.
