            <ul>
    <li><b>Philosophy and Practical Advice</b>: Leo begins by acknowledging the deep philosophical nature of discussing life's purpose and aims to give practical advice on how it influences day–to–day living.
</li><li><b>Controversial Nature of Life's Purpose</b>: He knows the subject is controversial and offers his view that life inherently has no purpose, a concept he considers deeply and one derived from thorough study.
</li><li><b>Reality Versus Internal World</b>: Leo distinguishes between an external, neutral reality and an internal world within the mind where emotions and meaning exist exclusively.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of Purpose</b>: He drives home the point that there is no single, objective purpose to life; rather, it's a subjective creation based on individual perspective, analogous to Henry Ford's self–fulfilling prophecy.
</li><li><b>Neutrality of the Universe</b>: Leo reinforces that the universe is indifferent to our desires, and within the confines of physical laws, people are free to believe anything they choose.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Purpose</b>: Despite his belief in the absence of an inherent life purpose, Leo is purpose–driven, aspiring to reach his full potential and live fully by experiencing and understanding life's beauty and truth.
</li><li><b>The Privilege of Understanding</b>: Leo values the capacity of the human mind to comprehend complex concepts and feels a sense of importance in the universe coming to understand itself through human consciousness.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Consciousness</b>: He appreciates consciousness, not just analytical as in humans but also experiential as found across living organisms, emphasizing the privilege of experiencing life's richness.
</li><li><b>Wastefulness in Lack of Engagement</b>: Leo regards it as wasteful to die without absorbing as much knowledge and experience as possible, while acknowledging that inactivity can also be chosen as a valid life path.
</li><li><b>Philosophy of Warrior's Path</b>: Citing Castaneda, Leo explains the warrior's commitment to a chosen path, understanding that the path, while deeply meaningful, is neither more nor less significant than any other.
</li><li><b>Individual Responsibility to Determine Purpose</b>: Leo insists people must figure out their own life purpose, implying that any chosen path is valid if it resonates personally with individual desire and passion.
</li><li><b>Biological Need for Self–Actualization</b>: Leo talks about Abraham Maslow's theory on the hierarchy of needs, stressing self–actualization as the ultimate human necessity that, when unfulfilled, leads to dissatisfaction and regret.
</li><li><b>Self–Actualization as Life's Ultimate Purpose</b>: Leo considers self–actualization as the highest purpose of life, aiming to help others become self–actualized through resources on his website, Actualized.org.
