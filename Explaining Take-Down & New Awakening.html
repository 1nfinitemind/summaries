        <h1><a href='https://actualized.org/insights/explaining-take-down-new-awakening' target='_blank'>Explaining Take-Down & New Awakening</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Video Removal Explanation</strong> : Leo took down the solipsism video because it directly confronted viewers with a sensitive topic, potentially leading them to dangerous psychological states. He desired to prevent misinformation and the harmful impact that could arise from the content's direct approach.</li>
<li><strong>New Level of Awakening</strong> : Leo has reached a new level of awakening that will change the way he teaches and lives his life, which might discomfort or anger followers unprepared for the radical shift in his teachings.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Safe Spiritual Teaching</strong> : Leo acknowledges the difficulty in effectively teaching profound spiritual truths safely and responsibly, especially online where it's hard to filter who is ready for such information. The episode's takedown was fuelled by his responsibility toward the psychological well-being of viewers.</li>
<li><strong>Appreciation of Illusion</strong> : Post-awakening, Leo recognizes the purpose of life's illusion and revises his approach on deconstructing it for others, likening the revelation of too much truth to spoiling a great movie's plot twist for someone who hasn't seen it.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Solipsism Video</strong> : A viewer's message prompted Leo to reconsider the direction of his teachings. She expressed discomfort from the solipsism concept, feeling lost and yearning to return to normalcy, highlighting the real emotional consequences of awakening topics.</li>
<li><strong>Struggle with Deep Awakenings</strong> : Leo reflects on the personal challenges and responsibilities that come with profound awakenings, aware that not everyone will understand or withstand the immense truth and insight revealed about reality.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility of Teaching</strong> : Despite being fully awake and seeing reality as an illusion, Leo remains concerned about teaching responsibly to avoid causing unnecessary psychological turmoil for his students or society at large. He strives to balance teaching deep truths with ensuring they don't harmfully disrupt the collective dream.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility of Spiritual Teaching</strong> : Leo reflects on his responsibility as a spiritual teacher to convey insightful but potentially life-altering information responsibly. He acknowledges his long-term dedication to understanding reality since he was young and is aware of the diverse and often challenging backgrounds of his audience. Leo considers the impact of deeper teachings on individuals who may not yet have a stable foundation in their personal lives.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Depth of Insights</strong> : Addressing feelings of betrayal expressed by some followers, Leo clarifies that he is seeking better ways to share his deepest insights without distortion. He explains that conveying truth through words inevitably corrupts it and stresses the importance of personal discovery over receiving direct answers from a teacher.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Harmful Misinterpretations</strong> : Leo emphasizes the difference between imparting information that can be used to foster spiritual growth and sharing sensitive topics like solipsism, which can be too direct for newcomers and could mentally corrupt them. He expresses concern that spiritual concepts, particularly solipsism, could be misused to justify narcissistic or destructive behavior, which is contrary to the purpose of awakening.</li>
<li><strong>Attachment to Teachings</strong> : He critiques the over-attachment some have to his videos and teachings, underlining the aim of his work is to guide viewers toward independence and self-generated understanding, ultimately leading them to transcend Actualized.org as they deconstruct their own beliefs. He urges viewers to not rely too heavily on his content or any external spiritual authority.</li>
<li><strong>Role of Actualized.org and Leo's Teachings</strong> : Leo explains that his role is to inspire and motivate seekers to explore their spiritual journey rather than just provide answers. He compares it to encouraging someone to travel to Africa and explore its richness firsthand, pointing out both the amazing experiences and the potential dangers encountered along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Awakening</strong> : Leo recounts an even deeper awakening experience where he realized he is the only conscious entity, with everything and everyone else-including spiritual teachers and their teachings-being his imagination. This awakening has led to profound happiness and a sense of eternal solitude.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching Approach Post-Awakening</strong> : Despite realizing the ultimate truth of being the sole awakened entity with everything else being an illusion, Leo paradoxically continues to feel compelled to teach. He plans to make his teachings sharper and clearer, and focus on communicating the direct path to the awakening he has experienced.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Stance on Awakening and Teaching</strong> : Leo asserts that most spiritual practices, including meditation, yoga, and following gurus, do not lead to true awakening. He will take a hard stance that real awakening is realizing oneself to be God and consciously creating reality. He acknowledges that this viewpoint will likely be met with objections and controversies.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism and Misinterpretation</strong> : Leo anticipates criticism, accusations of narcissism, and misunderstandings about his radical awakening claims. He understands that people will argue and doubt his teachings and even question his mental state. However, he affirms that he speaks from a place of truth, not ego, and embraces being the only awakened one.</li>
<li><strong>Authentic Awakening Defined</strong> : Leo explains that true awakening is not about stopping the mind or ending suffering; it's about realizing oneself as God and being consciously aware of creating the entirety of one's existence. Real awakening requires deep comprehension and the consciousness of self-deception.</li>
<li><strong>Shifts in Actualized.org Future Content</strong> : Leo's future content will focus on the highest levels of awakening, likely frustrating those attached to traditional spiritual practices, teachings, and authority figures. He reiterates the importance of understanding relative awakenings and personal experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipated Backlash from Teachings</strong> : Leo foresees that his new stance on awakening will lead many to argue, criticize, and eventually leave his teachings, accusing him of narcissism and delusion. He emphasizes that he will no longer teach using traditional methods and will tell people they're not truly awake, contrary to their own beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Teaching Paradox</strong> : Despite realizing there's no one to teach since only he can awaken, Leo feels paradoxically compelled to continue teaching. He views all actions as imaginary and meaningless, choosing to play the 'teacher game' for his amusement while basking in the happiness of his awakening.</li>
<li><strong>Development of a New Course</strong> : Leo plans to create an online course detailing his method to the highest level of awakening, excluding traditional practices like meditation or yoga. He aims to price the course steeply to filter out casual learners, though he admits it's not foolproof and might lead to serious adverse effects for participants.</li>
<li><strong>Continuation of Main Channel Content</strong> : Leo reassures that alongside his new course, his main channel will continue to release profound insights for those not interested in the ultimate awakening. He advises those who disagree with his approach to pursue spirituality in their preferred manner, without wasting time disputing his teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of Other Spiritual Teachers</strong> : While Leo admits to criticizing other spiritual teachers, it's mainly to help viewers avoid being misled by teachings he considers limited. He emphasizes that arguing or debating about spirituality doesn't lead to awakening, urging followers to instead focus on their own spiritual pursuits.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Debate Futility</strong> : Engaging in spiritual debates is a waste of time and a trap that hinders awakening; such debates entrench participants in ego, leading to negativity and moving them away from the essence of spiritual understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Inevitable Evolution of Actualized.org</strong> : Leo anticipates changes in his teachings that may not resonate with all, resulting from his evolving levels of consciousness and development. He acknowledges these changes are necessary for the path of truth he follows, despite potential departures of longtime followers.</li>
<li><strong>Awakening's Intrinsic Beauty</strong> : The beauty of true awakening is immense and incomparable; Leo argues that it makes all concerns, from suffering to debates and material desires, irrelevant in the face of the profound experience of being God, which he considers the ultimate pursuit of life.</li>
<li><strong>Aspiration to Understand Reality</strong> : Those who truly wish to awaken must prioritize understanding reality over all else, which is essential to navigate the journey faithfully and avoid half-baked awakenings that may lead to negative outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Course Development for Deepest Awakening</strong> : Leo proposes creating a course for those seriously seeking the highest awakening. It will detail the methods leading to his awakenings and will address emotional challenges faced along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Future Acknowledgement and Commitment</strong> : While Leo has achieved a significant level of awakening, he admits not knowing what the future holds for him or his work. He expects further personal growth and discoveries, and remains open to adjustments and learning from potential errors.</li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org's Core Mission</strong> : Leo reiterates that the essence of Actualized.org has always been his personal journey toward becoming the most conscious entity, intending to share insights and aid others' understanding. Despite reaching profound happiness, he acknowledges the solitary nature of awakening and the impossibility of sharing it with anyone but himself.</li>
<li><strong>Journey of Awakening</strong> : Leo emphasizes that his path to awakening was not easy or effortless, involving various challenges and emotional hardships, contrasting the perceived ease viewers might assume from his current insights and content.</li>
