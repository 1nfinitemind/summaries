            <p><em>"The knowable world is incomplete if seen from any one point of view,<br />
incoherent if seen from all points of view at once, and empty if seen from<br />
nowhere in particular." - Richard Shweder</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Relativism - Part 1</strong> : Leo introduces and explores the profound philosophical concept of relativism beyond the scope of Einstein's physics. He emphasizes that relativism encompasses various aspects, including social, cultural, moral, ethical, and epistemic, as well as ontological and physical. Understanding relativism is often challenging and threatens established worldviews. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Distinction Between Relativism and Absolutism</strong> : Relativism posits that all human beliefs, knowledge, and truth are relative, while absolutism asserts the existence of an objective reality and set of universal truths. Leo makes it clear that relativism does not equate to the absolute truth, which is an underlying, grounding truth distinct from any relativistic views. </li>
<li><strong>Different Types of Relativism</strong> : Leo delineates various kinds of relativism such as: social and cultural (customs and laws across societies), moral and ethical (moral standards across time), epistemic (different ways of knowing the world), and the more profound ontological and physical relativism (questioning the objectivity of the physical world). </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in Understanding</strong> : Leo explains that understanding concepts, such as the size of an elephant, is possible only through the comparison of other things&mdash;this process of comparison is the essence of relativity. Without comparing, humans cannot discern concepts like 'large' or 'small.' He stresses the importance of acknowledging that our perspectives are not impartial or objective but are inherently comparative. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in Science</strong> : Despite the common perception of science as an objective truth, Leo argues that scientific knowledge is relative to its time, and what is considered scientific may change with the evolution of understanding. He also cautions that disagreements among scientists often stem from different perspectives and paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Relativism's Role in Perceiving Reality</strong> : Leo insists that acceptance of relativism is key to unlocking a more accurate and comprehensive picture of reality. He maintains that there is an absolute truth, but our discussion of it is inevitably steeped in relativity. He invites individuals to be open to experiencing this absolute directly for profound personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Perception of Relativity</strong> : Leo demonstrates that relativity affects our perspective on common observations, such as the size of an elephant only being large when compared to a smaller creature, or the varying angles of a triangle on different geometric planes. He stresses that the 'facts' of a situation can remain the same while our perspectives on it can significantly alter based on our interpretations. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in Geometry</strong> : The concept of relativity is evident in geometry, where Euclidean geometry's rules apply only on a flat plane, but change on a curved surface. This exemplifies relativity within academic disciplines, challenging the notion of absolute truths within these fields. </li>
<li><strong>Interpretation of Facts and Relativity</strong> : Leo argues that the impact the 'facts' have on us does not depend solely on the facts themselves, but rather on the perspective we take. He uses the glass half-full or half-empty analogy to illustrate how the same fact can evoke different emotions and interpretations depending on one's outlook. </li>
<li><strong>Physical Relativity and General Relativity</strong> : The Eiffel Tower's height is given as an example of physical relativity, showing that an object's measured properties, such as length, can change based on the observer's movement and velocity relative to the object. This underpins Einstein's theory of general relativity, which presents a reality that defies our intuitive understandings. </li>
<li><strong>Science as Relative</strong> : Leo underscores that the truths of science are contingent on the times, evoking humility in our current understanding and openness to future change, development, and the co-existence of alternative methods for comprehending the world. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in Personal Taste and Opinion</strong> : Using dining experiences as an analogy, Leo shows relativity in individual tastes and opinions, demonstrating that reality differs from person to person, shaping our diverse and multifaceted world. </li>
<li><strong>Open-mindedness in Relativism</strong> : To truly grasp the concept of relativism, Leo encourages an openness to other points of view, warning that quick dismissal of differing perspectives can lead to a biased and absolutist worldview. </li>
<li><strong>Historical Context of Relativism</strong> : Leo revisits Anaximander's philosophical resolution of the floating Earth problem, highlighting the ancient realization that concepts like up and down are relative, framing this as a pivotal historical moment in the development of relativistic thought. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in History and Philosophy</strong> : Scientific and philosophical advancements often stem from acknowledging relativity, as Leo points out with the example of Copernicus's heliocentric model, which was initially resisted due to prevailing geocentric views but later accepted, altering humanity's self-centric view of the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge in Understanding Motion and Moral Frameworks</strong> : Due to our inherent position within our moral frameworks and physical presence on Earth, it's difficult for us to perceive the relative nature of these constructs and acknowledge their movement or evolution. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Discovering the Americas</strong> : The European discovery of the Americas was a significant relativistic shock, demonstrating the diversity of human cultures, beliefs, and practices, and challenging the European monolithic worldview. </li>
<li><strong>Confrontation with Cultural and Religious Differences</strong> : Encountering vastly different cultures and religions, like those in the Americas, forced Europeans to question the superiority of their own practices and often led to conflict as they attempted to "civilize" or convert indigenous populations. </li>
<li><strong>Absolutism VS Relativism in Historical Context</strong> : The resistance to acknowledging the validity of indigenous American cultures exemplifies the dangers of absolutism. In contrast, adopting a relativistic perspective fosters open-mindedness and more accurate exploration of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Magellan's Circumnavigation and the Relativity of Time</strong> : Magellan's crew's discovery, upon returning to Europe, that they had lost a day highlighted the relativity of time and led to practical adaptations such as time zones and the establishment of Greenwich Mean Time. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural and Religious Relativity</strong> : As people experienced diverse cultures and religious practices through increased global travel, they faced cultural shock and began questioning the validity and absoluteness of their own cultural norms and religious beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>US Constitution and Religious Pluralism</strong> : The US Constitution's guarantee of religious pluralism was revolutionary at the time, challenging theocratic governance and paving the way for a society that acknowledged religious diversity. </li>
<li><strong>Shift from Absolutism to Relativism in Cognitive Development</strong> : The acceptance of the US Constitution's religious pluralism represented a paradigm shift in cognitive development from an absolutist viewpoint to a relativistic one. </li>
<li><strong>Advancement of Relativism through Geometry</strong> : The realization that Euclidean geometry's postulates did not hold on curved or multi-dimensional surfaces symbolized the advancement of scientific thought and the acceptance of relativism in understanding the world. </li>
<li><strong>Quantum Mechanics and the Relativity of Observation</strong> : Quantum mechanics demonstrated that observation affects the state of the observed, leading to the conclusion that measurements are inherently relative, not absolute, challenging traditional views of an independent reality. </li>
<li><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Relativity</strong> : Quantum mechanics reveals that measurement isn't absolute but entangled with the measuring instrument. Objects cannot be observed objectively as the act of measurement affects the observed, precluding any definitive account of an object's nature without the influence of the observation method employed. </li>
<li><strong>Persistence of Materialistic Worldviews</strong> : Despite quantum mechanics challenging established scientific thinking, many scientists still resist acknowledging its metaphysical and epistemic implications. This resistance hinders a deeper understanding of reality and impedes personal development by reinforcing a materialistic, absolutist paradigm. </li>
<li><strong>Interconnectedness of Science and Personal Development</strong> : Leo illustrates the direct link between scientific understanding and personal development. Recognizing relativity within scientific concepts like the indistinguishable nature of observer and observed can broaden one's ability to progress in self-actualization. </li>
<li><strong>Relative Nature of Spacetime</strong> : Einstein's theory of general relativity demonstrated the relativity of time, space, motion, and length, showing that dimensions like the length of an object are relative to the observer's speed and position. Despite empirical validation, the radical implications for notions of absolute physical realities are often underestimated or outright denied. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Z5vTGbxP/406-Understanding-Relativism-Part-1-Image-7.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denial and Resistance to Relativistic Discoveries</strong> : Historically, each major relativistic discovery, such as Einstein's theories or non-Euclidean geometry, has faced rejection and ridicule from those unwilling to relinquish their absolutist worldviews. This denial is rooted in the intrinsic link between an individual's identity and their perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Leonard Susskind's Acknowledgment of Relativity</strong> : Citing prominent physicist Leonard Susskind, Leo points out that even renowned scientists may not fully comprehend the extent of relativity's impact on our understanding of reality, despite acknowledging that different observers perceive different realities. </li>
<li><strong>Caution Against Oversimplifying Relativity</strong> : Leo warns against trivializing the concept of relativity. He explains that it's a complex idea that requires significant consideration and study, and it's easy to misconstrue it without thoroughly grasping its nuances. </li>
<li><strong>Discovery of Multiple Logics</strong> : The realization that there are infinitely many forms of logic beyond Aristotelian logic further emphasizes the relativity of logical systems, expanding the landscape from a singular 'true' logic to a multiplicity of equally valid logical frameworks. </li>
<li><strong>Quinn's Ontological Relativism</strong> : Quinn's theory proposes that language and worldview are so closely intertwined with an individual's ontology that truly comprehending another's perspective requires immersing oneself deeply in their culture and experiencing their reality firsthand. </li>
<li><strong>Thomas Kuhn's Paradigm Theory</strong> : Kuhn's paradigm theory, alongside the concept of incommensurability, suggests that science progresses through different worldviews that can never be fully reconciled, making scientific progress relative to the prevailing paradigm. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Post-Modernism and Further Relativization</strong> : The latter half of the 20th century saw further entrenchment of relativistic thinking through post-modernism, disrupting traditional societal norms and introducing relativism into aspects like language and cultural expressions. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in the Academic World</strong> : In the late 20th century, global interconnectedness made the idea of cultural or worldview superiority untenable for academics. This shift towards relativism was more apparent in social sciences and humanities than in the hard sciences, which still often hold on to materialistic and reductionistic worldviews. </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgment of Relativism in Social Constructs</strong> : Relativism was further acknowledged in aspects of sexuality and gender, leading to the understanding that concepts like male and female or heterosexuality and homosexuality are not absolutes but exist on a spectrum. However, this notion often faces resistance from traditionally oriented people. </li>
<li><strong>20th Century Discoveries and Relativism</strong> : Advancements in various fields&mdash;quantum mechanics, logic, linguistics, history of science, and the social sciences&mdash;significantly contributed to the recognition of relativism. Movements like the psychedelic revolution further emphasized this shift by challenging sexual norms, gender identities, and religious beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Academic Resistance to Absolutism</strong> : Academia, being at the forefront of human knowledge and understanding, has spearheaded relativistic revolutions by recognizing the limitations of absolutist positions. This approach has been vital because clinging to absolutism in academia risks being proven wrong and losing credibility. </li>
<li><strong>Relativism Versus Social Conventions</strong> : While relativism has been a deconstructive force, unsettling to those who hold tight to traditional worldviews, it is essential in the process of expanding human understanding. It must occur within academia, a cultural force at the cutting edge of new discoveries and thought. </li>
<li><strong>Contrast Between Western and Eastern Traditions</strong> : While Western tradition has historically held more absolutist views, Eastern philosophy has recognized the concept of relativity for thousands of years. The Jain concept of 'Anekantavada,' or the doctrine of many-sidedness, illustrates Eastern culture's longstanding embrace of relativism. </li>
<li><strong>Anekantavada Explained</strong> : The origins trace back to the teachings of Mahavira, where he argued for the relativity of truth and reality. Jainism holds that truth cannot be fully conveyed through language, as reality is too complex and multifaceted. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Illustration of Relativity through Anekantavada</strong> : The concept of 'Anekantavada' is applied to a cooking pot, showing it can simultaneously exist, not exist, and be inexpressible based on various perspectives. This perspective underscores how reality can be perceived differently. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Relativism of Morality and Suffering</strong> : Leo Gura discusses the complex topic of the relative nature of morality and suffering. He uses the example of slavery to illustrate that what society deems 'wrong' is heavily dependent on the current cultural and societal norms, which can change over time. The assessment of slavery as wrong is based on the current consensus that it causes suffering and infringes upon personal freedoms, yet this consensus is a product of the current societal framework. </li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/02Fv0g1z/406-Understanding-Relativism-Part-1-Image-14.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BvGGRx6s/406-Understanding-Relativism-Part-1-Image-15.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frame of Reference in Discussions</strong> : Gura emphasizes the importance of identifying the frame of reference in discussions and debates. Statements such as something being 'true' or 'rational' are made within a specific context, which is often left ambiguous. Gura encourages viewers to always question the frame of reference from which a statement is made to clarify the context and uncover the underlying assumptions. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity and Emotional Responses</strong> : Leo points out that emotional responses to concepts like suffering and slavery are relative, in that they depend on personal experiences and interests. For example, an individual's aversion to suffering is related to their own dislike of pain. He suggests that one's perspective on suffering can shift if they explore the idea deeply and consider scenarios where suffering might be desired. </li>
<li><strong>Relativism in Judgments and Beliefs</strong> : Gura exhorts listeners to apply relativism to their personal beliefs and judgments. He prompts thoughtful inquiry into the reasons behind one's views on good, evil, or suffering. This process reveals that such judgments are anchored in personal preferences and survival strategies, and not universally applicable truths. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking and Relativity</strong> : Leo urges critical thinking and careful interpretation of claims. He illustrates that words like 'true,' 'rational,' or 'real' are often shorthand for more nuanced statements that include an implicit frame of reference, which should be explicitly understood for a more accurate comprehension of the claims being made. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in Perceptions of Reality</strong> : Leo delves into the notion that reality is perceived relative to different states of consciousness. He posits that ordinary waking life, dreams, and higher consciousness states reveal different levels of 'reality,' and that profound experiences, such as those induced by psychedelics or awakening experiences, can change one's understanding of what is real. </li>
<li><strong>Practical Application of Relativism</strong> : Gura offers practical advice for applying relativism to everyday situations. He provides examples of translating commonly made statements into their relativistic equivalents, stressing that every assertion about reality includes an unspoken "relative to X" clause, inviting exploration of that clause for greater clarity. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity versus Equivalence</strong> : Leo clarifies that relativism does not imply equivalence. For instance, he states that science and witchcraft are not inherently better or worse than one another, but their effectiveness is relative to the context and the objectives being pursued. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding of Hitler and Relativism</strong> : Gura uses the extreme example of Adolf Hitler to explore the relativistic nature of labeling someone as 'good' or 'bad.' He applies the principle of Anekantavada to demonstrate that conflicting perspectives on Hitler's morality coexist, highlighting the dangers of oversimplifying complex human figures and histories into binary judgments. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of Knowledge, Beliefs, and Existence</strong> : Concluding his discourse on relativism, Leo Gura lists several aspects of life that are relative, including aesthetics, beliefs, science, units of measurement, and even our conception of life and death. Every belief, opinion, and scientific statement is relative to the conceptual framework and perspective from which it arises. </li>
<li><strong>Infinite complexity of physical objects</strong> : Physical objects like a hand are infinitely complex, composed of cells, molecules, atoms, quarks, and more. There is no definitive number of components, as they can be infinitely divided, demonstrating the relativity in defining physical objects. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of scientific patterns and relationships</strong> : Science focuses on identifying patterns and relationships within nature, all of which are relative to the observer's perspective and the context, chosen based on their utility for survival. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity spans all domains</strong> : Rationality, logic, analysis, critique, knowledge, understanding, language, symbols, thoughts, concepts, paradigms, models, theories, epistemologies, physical objects, perception, history, culture, survival, meaning, significance, value, purpose, goals, motivations, morality, ethics, norms, judgments, religions, spiritual teachings, justice, law, criminality, government, problems, health, success, failure, happiness, suffering, pain, pleasure, sanity, insanity, birth, life, death, sense of self, notion of other human beings, drawing of categories, and dualities&mdash;all these are relative. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity and the Absolute</strong> : Leo addresses the concept of the Absolute, which is what is not relative. This notion suggests the existence of an underlying truth or reality beyond the relative constructs and perspectives. </li>
<li><strong>Intermission announcement</strong> : Leo takes a momentary break before addressing common objections to relativism. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the relativity of statements</strong> : Statements like "snow is white" are relative, subject to ontological and metaphysical assumptions, specific empirical contexts, human perceptual systems, language use, and differ across species and hypothetical aliens. </li>
<li><strong>Relativism and illness</strong> : The experience of illness like cancer is relative, influenced by identification with the physical body, underlying the discussion of famed sage Ramana Maharshi's perspective on his own cancer. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity in science</strong> : Science as a truth-providing enterprise is relative, bound by the specific era, cultural conceptions, methodological standards, and is subject to evolution over time. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific consensus and disagreement</strong> : Scientists often disagree on interpreting data, with consensus being a result of shared backgrounds, education, culture, similar DNA, and states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Existence of the Absolute amidst relative facts</strong> : Leo asserts the existence of an absolute truth or 'being,' distinct from subjective data and facts, which cannot be fully understood through conventional means. </li>
<li><strong>Leo Gura's Discussion on Absolute Being</strong> : Being is the substrate of everything and is absolute, while what humans often consider as facts and data are conceptual projections relative to being. To truly know the absolute truth or being, one must overcome self-agendas, conceptual schemes, paradigms, worldviews, self-deceptions, and the whole perceptual system – a process achievable through a state of Samadhi or the union of subject and object. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of Data and Facts</strong> : Data and facts are not the same as the absolute being; they are relative constructs influenced by our projections and worldview. Scientists may have consensus on certain data due to shared characteristics, perceptions, and culture, but this consensual reality is still not the absolute truth. </li>
<li><strong>Addressing the Question of Being 'Factually Wrong'</strong> : Despite the nuances of relativism, it is still possible to be 'factually wrong.' This concept means that one's perspectives have shifted over time, they have delved deeper into reality, and recognized past misconceptions or errors in their understanding, allowing for worldview correction. </li>
<li><strong>Flat Earth and Relative Perceptions</strong> : Perspectives on whether the Earth is flat or round are relative to individual consciousness and projections. For a flat earther, the Earth might appear flat based on their metaphysical outlook and expectations. However, this does not mean the physical reality itself varies with belief; rather, it's the individual's perception that is relative. </li>
<li><strong>Historical Relativity</strong> : The interpretation of history is influenced by the individual's worldview, cherry-picking elements that fit into their conception of history. No one has a complete history, it's an interplay of interpretations and selective emphasis. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of Good and Evil</strong> : Concepts of good and evil are defined in a manner that is relative to individual survival strategies; they are not objective measures but stem from what aids or hinders one's survival, varying considerably across different people. </li>
<li><strong>Building a Society with Relative Values</strong> : Societal values can be built on shared human needs and commonalities, despite their relative nature. The process of creating a consensus and cooperation is challenging but possible. </li>
<li><strong>Constancy of the Speed of Light</strong> : Even the speed of light, often considered constant, can be argued as relative as it varies in different mediums and fluctuates minutely as hypothesized by some scientists. Furthermore, it's unknown if its speed was constant throughout the universe's history. </li>
<li><strong>Subjectivity of Earth's Existence</strong> : The continuation of the Earth's existence after one's death is a relative concept, as the Earth's existence is tied to the individual's personal perspective. When an individual dies, from their viewpoint, the Earth ceases to exist. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding and Objections to Relativism</strong> : Relativism does not make all perspectives or beliefs equal or factual, and it allows for the coexistence of multiple perspectives, with some being factually inaccurate when compared to a broader reality or a changed understanding over time. </li>
<li><strong>Relativity of Speed of Light and Universe</strong> : The concept that the speed of light might be constant within the universe doesn't preclude different conditions or speeds outside of it. Considering nested contexts and frames of reference, the constancy of light speed may not be universal. </li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment as the Absolute</strong> : Leo Gura explains that enlightenment is the one aspect of existence that is not relative but absolute. Enlightenment is the awakening to the absolute reality that transcends relativity and can only be experienced, not imagined. </li>
<li><strong>Contradiction in Relativism</strong> : Leo discusses objections regarding the potential self-nullifying nature of relativism, as it suggests everything is relative but also seeks to assert itself as true. He clarifies that acknowledging language and teaching as relative doesn't contradict the existence of the absolute. </li>
<li><strong>Absoluteness of the Absolute versus Relativity of Language and Concepts</strong> : While Leo's teachings, words, and concepts are relative, they point toward the absolute reality which cannot be described or communicated directly. Recognizing the absolute requires going beyond words and experiencing it. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Teachings</strong> : Leo acknowledges that no single teaching, including his, can encapsulate the entire "elephant" (i.e., reality). He emphasizes the necessity of personally exploring and experiencing reality to understand its entirety. </li>
<li><strong>Objective of Explaining Relativity</strong> : Leo asserts that understanding relativity is crucial for grasping the nature of reality and for personal development. He encourages viewers to approach the topic as a means to deepen their knowledge, not merely as a philosophical exercise. </li>
<li><strong>Calls for Critical Engagement with Ideas</strong> : Instead of accepting his teachings as absolute, Leo Gura invites viewers to critically think, contemplate, and question the content, which will aid in recognizing any errors and in achieving personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional Reactions to Relativism</strong> : Leo advises viewers to introspect their emotional triggers when encountering ideas on relativism, as these reactions often highlight areas tied to their survival instincts and worldviews that merit further exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Final Notes on Part 1 and Invitation to Part 2</strong> : Leo wraps up part one by emphasizing the importance of relativism in understanding and invites viewers to stay tuned for part two, reiterating the importance of not just passively consuming information but actively engaging with it.</li>
