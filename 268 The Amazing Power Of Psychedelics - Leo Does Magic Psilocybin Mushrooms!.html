            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ypDRRcMKj7E' target='_blank'>The Amazing Power Of Psychedelics - Leo Does Magic Psilocybin Mushrooms!</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Power of psychedelics for self–actualization</b>: Leo is exploring psychedelics, specifically magic psilocybin mushrooms, for their potential to enhance consciousness and aid in personal growth, rather than for recreation.
</li><li><b>Immediate meditative and awareness effects</b>: Upon consuming mushrooms, Leo experiences a heightened state of awareness reminiscent of the clarity one might feel after a 10–day intense meditation retreat, causing an immediate sense of amazement and hyper–awareness.
</li><li><b>Visual hallucinogenic effects</b>: About an hour into the trip, Leo observes vivid, saturated colors and patterns that emerge on flat surfaces, displaying complex, tribal floral designs that are both hypnotizing and beautiful, reminiscent of ancient civilizations' atmospheres.
</li><li><b>Frequency and nature of psychedelic trances</b>: Leo experiences powerful trances that repeatedly consume him during his trip, causing him to lose consciousness and sense of self. Upon emerging from these trances, he is left with profound insights and wisdom.
</li><li><b>Integration of experiences and education</b>: Leo attributes his positive experiences with mushrooms to his extensive background in various disciplines like meditation, psychology, metaphysics, and non–duality, suggesting that this groundwork is crucial to how one perceives and handles psychedelic experiences.
</li><li><b>Duration of psychedelic effects</b>: Leo's psychedelic experience with magic mushrooms lasted about four to six hours, with trance effects fading after four hours, leaving behind lingering patterns and sensations.
</li><li><b>Animalistic behavior during trip</b>: Leo felt like he was behaving like a primitive creature during the peak of his trip, mimicking animal–like movements and experiencing a sense of being a creature raised in the wild without any language.
</li><li><b>Contrast between typical behavior and uninhibited state</b>: The trip prompted insights into Leo's everyday reserved behaviors versus the uninhibited, authentic animal–like state induced by mushrooms. He felt his movements were more natural, loose, and authentic during the trip, offering a refreshing contrast to his usual restrained and artificial actions.
</li><li><b>Delusional aspects of the psychedelic experience</b>: Despite having profound insights, Leo recognized the delusional quality of his trip. He found himself laughing hysterically and talking to himself as though he were having the most profound thoughts, only to realize later that some insights, while interesting, were not as groundbreaking as they seemed during the trip.
</li><li><b>Amazement at the human body</b>: Looking at himself in the mirror, Leo was astonished by his own human features, experiencing a childlike sense of wonder and amazement at his hands, face, and the existence of his body. 
</li><li><b>Visual hallucinations and self–perception</b>: Leo observed luminous, flower–like patterns on his face, similar to tribal tattoos, which made him feel like a native from the Amazon. This was accompanied by a compelling visual of light rays emanating from behind his head, creating a halo effect.
</li><li><b>Ontological orgasm during the second trip</b>: Leo describes experiencing an 'ontological orgasm' during his second mushroom trip, which gave him a profound sense of ego loss and the realization that his life's narrative was a complete fiction.
</li><li><b>Rapid onset and ego loss realization</b>: With a quicker onset during his second trip, Leo felt a creeping sensation of ego loss, eventually leading to a powerful realization that his life's story was an illusion, culminating in a state of surrender to the psychedelic experience.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic narrative deconstruction</b>: Leo discusses how psilocybin mushrooms can dismantle a person's life narrative, reveling in how the substance dismantles his own perceptions of existence, identity, and personal history, leading to laughter and a sense of absurdity.
</li><li><b>Meta–analysis of reality</b>: Leo uses mushrooms to achieve a meta–state of consciousness, comparing his everyday life experiences with the hallucinatory mushroom state, leading to insights that transcend both realities and suggest neither is the ultimate form of truth.
</li><li><b>Ontological orgasm</b>: Describing his philosophical insights as becoming tangibly real, Leo experiences what he calls an "ontological orgasm," a profound realization where the distinction between real and unreal, along with the concept of being born, dissolves into absurdity and laughter.
</li><li><b>Breakthrough to divine love</b>: Leo details how his psychedelic experience culminated in a breakthrough into divine love and bliss, where tears of joy express his immersion into the infinite nature of existence.
</li><li><b>Non–dual perception and indiscriminate love</b>: In his non–dual state of perception, Leo expresses love for mundane objects like a vomit bucket, treating them with profound admiration, and disregards conventional notions of cleanliness and impropriety.
</li><li><b>Time as an illusion</b>: Leo views time as a human construct and an illusion, experiencing a permanent now that is disconnected from the traditional linear concept of time.
</li><li><b>Mundane transformed by divine love</b>: Leo expresses profound love and beauty towards objects typically viewed as dirty or insignificant, such as a clump of pubic hair, lint, and dirt, perceiving them as manifestations of divine beauty.
</li><li><b>A prayer of profound gratitude</b>: In a state of deep reverence, Leo's body becomes an instrument of gratitude, leading him to pray fervently, an action borne out of an overwhelming sense of the beauty and sanctity of existence.
</li><li><b>Experience of Praying</b>: Leo felt a deep sense of the sacredness and beauty of existence during his mushroom trip, leading him to understand the true intention behind religious practices, which he believes are not about beliefs or rituals but about experiencing divine love and wisdom.
</li><li><b>Intense Non–Dual Awareness</b>: Following his bathroom experience, Leo entered a state of thick non–dual awareness, feeling as though he had achieved full enlightenment and reached the wisdom of historical sages and saints. He felt that he had experienced nirvana and reached the pinnacle of enlightenment with nothing left to achieve.
</li><li><b>Feeling of Enlightenment Completion</b>: During this phase of intense non–dual awareness, Leo had the sensation that his life was fully realized and that even death would be perfect. He was struck by the profound sense of completeness and perfection of existence.
</li><li><b>Desire to Share Insights</b>: Despite feeling fully enlightened, Leo was overwhelmed with the need to share his profound insights with others, recognizing it as his life purpose. He was struck by a deep compassion to impart this wisdom to his audience.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Communication</b>: Leo articulated the difficulty of sharing the ineffable, powerful insights of his experience with those unfamiliar with such states of consciousness, questioning how to communicate the experience effectively.
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Life Purpose Insights</b>: From his psychedelic experience, Leo gained insights into the importance of authenticity and directions to take his work with Actualized.org to deeper levels, reinforcing his life purpose.
</li><li><b>Insignificance of Achievement</b>: One palpable insight Leo emphasized was the realization that the concept of achievement and success is illusory and that nothing tangible needs to be achieved in life.
</li><li><b>Lasting Effects of Mushrooms</b>: After his trip, Leo felt a lasting calmness, detachment, and increased resolve and motivation for enlightenment and meditative practices. His resolve was supercharged by the realization that such work is the only truly meaningful pursuit in life.
</li><li><b>Comparison of Existence Joy to Conventional Life</b>: Leo experienced such profound joy and beauty in the state of enlightenment that it made all conventional life pursuits, such as business and family, seem meaningless by contrast.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as Self–Actualization Tools</b>: Leo believes psychedelics can offer a glimpse of the most advanced self–actualization concepts he has discussed, bolstering one's resolve for pursuing deeper work in meditation or self–inquiry.
</li><li><b>Depth of Societal Ignorance</b>: Highlighting the pervasive ignorance in society, Leo suggests that most people live like a baby raised in a prison cell, never knowing there's anything beyond their confined reality, emphasizing the deep ignorance most people have regarding their own ignorance.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Direct Teaching</b>: Leo defends his blunt and sometimes obnoxious teaching style as necessary to awaken people from their ignorance, suggesting that anything less would not be effective in encouraging the pursuit of true enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Understating the Significance of Enlightenment</b>: Leo acknowledges that he might exaggerate the significance of enlightenment in his teachings, but asserts that anyone who has achieved non–dual awareness would see his statements as understatements, given the depth of most people's ignorance.
</li><li><b>Reaction to Enlightenment Teachings</b>: Leo notes the defensive reactions he often encounters when challenging people's life values with his teachings on enlightenment, and laments that such reactions prevent the transformative potential of enlightenment from being realized.
</li><li><b>Teaching style of Zen masters versus Leo's approach</b>: Zen masters may embody bliss and detachment without actively promoting their insights, often understating the experience of enlightenment. In contrast, Leo takes on the role of bluntly communicating the significance of these insights, aiming to provoke a shift in awareness in his audience.
</li><li><b>The challenge of overcoming ignorance</b>: Humanity's primary obstacle throughout history has been ignorance, particularly regarding the truth of enlightenment. Sages and Zen masters have struggled to convey their knowledge to others who are deeply entranced by mundane life and dismissive of profound truths.
</li><li><b>Role of psychedelics in awakening</b>: Leo points out that while psychedelics are not crucial for him due to his dedicated work in enlightenment, they can serve as a wake–up call for those indifferent to deeper realities, granting them a taste of what they're missing out on due to their limited vision.
</li><li><b>Responsibility and misuse of psychedelics</b>: The misuse of psychedelics, whether for recreation, confirmation of spiritual beliefs, or as a shortcut, is often more psychologically damaging than physical. Psychedelics require a well–prepared mind and should be used responsibly, enhancing the work of self–actualization rather than replacing it.
</li><li><b>Misconception of psychedelics as an enlightenment path</b>: Leo stresses that psychedelics do not lead to enlightenment and warns against the belief that they can be a substitute for the rigorous work required for true personal development.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as tools for self–actualization</b>: For earnest practitioners of self–actualization, psychedelics can be powerful tools that broaden their understanding and deepen their experiences, but should not be mistaken for the achievement of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Harnessing psychedelics for therapeutic purposes</b>: Beyond the quest for personal growth, psychedelics hold therapeutic potential for healing, addiction treatment, and providing insights into life, thereby kindling an interest in reality and truth.
</li><li><b>Anticipation for responsible psychedelic use</b>: Leo announces an upcoming episode focusing on responsible psychedelic use for personal growth, promising to offer practical tips, discuss appropriate substances, and underscore the importance of self–actualization as the ultimate aim.
