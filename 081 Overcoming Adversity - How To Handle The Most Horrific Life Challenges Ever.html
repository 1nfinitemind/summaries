            <ul>
    <li><b>Affirmations as a resilience tool</b>: Leo discusses an affirmation he uses: "I can handle any challenge any situation that life throws at me." Repeating this daily has made him more confident in his ability to overcome adversity, suggesting that others adopt this practice to strengthen their belief in their resilience.
</li><li><b>Reflection on past adversities</b>: He reflects on past struggles and recognizes they were instrumental in personal growth and sometimes success. Leo emphasizes that we are naturally equipped to handle adversity due to our biological and psychological makeup.
</li><li><b>Human survival instinct</b>: Leo considers the survival instinct that is genetically ingrained in us, explaining that as living organisms, we are designed to handle even the most extreme circumstances, a notion he finds empowering when meditated upon.
</li><li><b>Historical human resilience</b>: Considering human history as hunter–gatherers, Leo highlights the incredible resilience of our ancestors. By doing so, he puts modern–day problems into perspective, reminding us of our inherent capacity to endure harsh conditions.
</li><li><b>Domestication and resilience loss</b>: Drawing from Don Miguel Ruiz's "The Four Agreements", Leo suggests that although modern life's comforts have somewhat 'domesticated' us, our deep–seated resilience remains unchanged, and we're still capable of withstanding severe challenges.
</li><li><b>Catastrophizing and the mind's tricks</b>: Leo points out that our brain tends to exaggerate problems, a habit originating from when life–threatening challenges were common. He encourages discerning between actual threats and exaggerated fears.
</li><li><b>Reprogramming the subconscious</b>: Through perseverance with affirmations, Leo aims to embed the belief deeply into his subconscious that he can handle any situation, which he hopes will mitigate the emotional lows of future challenges.
</li><li><b>Resilience almost infinite</b>: He asserts the near–infinite resilience inherent in human beings, recommending Victor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" to understand the extent to which ordinary people can survive and thrive after extreme adversity.
</li><li><b>Encouraging affirmation practice</b>: Finally, Leo encourages practicing the affirmation regularly to reprogram the mind, saying it will reduce the depth of future emotional 'dips' and increase empowerment. He closes by inviting feedback on the topic and promoting his website, actualized.org.
