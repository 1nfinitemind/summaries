</li><li><b>Creating a personalized gratitude list</b>: He challenges viewers to come up with a list of 100 specific things they're grateful for, tailored to their own lives and experiences. This exercise is meant to uncover hidden appreciations and reflect on personal achievements and the unique aspects of one's life.
</li><li><b>Appreciating the current era</b>: Leo expresses his personal gratitude for living in the 21st century with its technology, knowledge, and a more favorable political climate than in the past, urging the audience to find gratitude in the advancements and comforts of the modern era.

</li><li><b>Psychology and Personal Development</b>: Gratitude extends to psychology, for the capacity of the mind to learn, grow, and engage in personal development, which transforms one's perspective and life.
</li><li><b>Societal Gratitude</b>: He conveys thanks for the country, state, and city we live in, including the political, legal, and emergency services that, despite imperfections, have evolved to support our lives far better than societies of the past.
</li><li><b>Economic System Appreciation</b>: Despite criticism, Leo admires the efficiency of the contemporary economy, emphasizing the incredible opportunity to exchange goods and services and the potential to earn unlimited money.
