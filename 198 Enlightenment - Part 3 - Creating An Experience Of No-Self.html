            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/NXd8ojx_jOY' target='_blank'>Enlightenment - Part 3 - Creating An Experience Of No-Self</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Objective of the Video</b>: To create a real experience of "no self" for viewers, which is described as an advanced concept in spiritual enlightenment that signifies the absence of an individual entity that perceives and experiences life.
</li><li><b>Foundation of Spiritual Alignment</b>: Leo does not intend to cover basic theories of spiritual alignment in this video; rather, the focus is on directly guiding viewers into experiencing no self through a guided meditation. He mentions that viewers should refer to his earlier videos for introductory information.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Enquiry as Empirical Investigation</b>: Emphasizing that spiritual enlightenment is an empirical investigation to realize the non–existence of self. It is not about beliefs but about firsthand experiences and consciousness of every moment.
</li><li><b>Guided Meditation Preparation</b>: Viewers are advised to find a quiet place free from distractions to participate in the guided meditation. Leo stresses the video's practical nature and the necessity for active participation.
</li><li><b>Reality Defined as Present Moment Experience</b>: Leo notes that only what exists right in the present moment is real. He advises viewers to accept this principle as an axiom for the guided meditation, stating that rigorous application of this principle can lead to enlightenment. Reality is not found in past recollections or future anticipations, but in the direct experience of the current moment.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as Experiential, Not Philosophical</b>: Enlightenment is framed as an experience of truth rather than a rational understanding or theory. The discussion focuses on the experiential nature rather than the conceptual or logical analysis of reality.
</li><li><b>Existence Beyond Rational Understanding</b>: The non–rational aspect of existence and the purpose of spiritual enlightenment are highlighted. Understanding existence and personal identity ("Who am I?") lies at the core of the matter, which cannot be comprehensively addressed by rational or logical means.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment Beyond Traditional Frameworks</b>: Enlightenment is insisted to be beyond familiar frameworks such as philosophy, belief, religious systems, and scientific models, piquing curiosity about its true nature.
</li><li><b>Dismissing Intermediaries to Experience Reality</b>: Leo discusses the aim to eliminate the middlemen of reality–such as theories, philosophies, religions, and scientific models, which are all essentially thoughts. He suggests that instead of thinking about reality, one could directly be reality without any intellectual intermediaries.
</li><li><b>Possibility of Direct Reality Experience</b>: Leo proposes that although it seems irrational or impossible, directly experiencing reality without relying on thoughts or concepts might be feasible, despite it being an unfamiliar process which people have not been taught or practiced.
</li><li><b>Guided Meditation for No–Self Experience</b>: Leo begins a meditation session, with credit given to Peter Ralston for inspiration, to guide viewers into a comfortable position to initiate an experience of 'no–self'. This state moves beyond thinking and conceptualizing to just being in the reality of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Relaxation and Presence in Meditation</b>: Viewers are guided to relax their muscles and bring focus to the present moment, noticing the multitude of sensations in their body. By acknowledging these sensations and the automatic processes like breathing and heartbeat, they are led toward presence and experiencing reality directly.
</li><li><b>Erasing Mental Constructs of Time and Possessions</b>: Leo invites viewers to imagine that their past, future, possessions, and societal roles do not exist and have never existed. This exercise aims to lead the individual to a centered presence in the moment, free from attachments, fears, and concerns.
</li><li><b>Elimination of Societal Influences and Personal Worries</b>: The viewers are guided to erase from their minds the existence of society and culture, social responsibilities, and personal worries. By doing so, they may reach a state of calm and peace, allowing themselves to experience a reality without societal or personal pressures.
</li><li><b>Elimination of Emotions</b>: Imagine that all emotions, such as happiness, sadness, excitement, and anger, have been completely erased and never existed in reality. This exercise removes the emotional aspect from our existence.
</li><li><b>Vanishing Opinions and Thoughts</b>: Visualize that all personal opinions, conceptualizations, stories about reality, and every thought have disappeared as if they never existed. This exercise seeks to release the need for opinions and operate in a thought–free state.
</li><li><b>Absence of Self–Image</b>: Consider that your self–image, including your visual conception of your body, name, personal history, and social connections, is entirely erased. Reflect on the pure existence of sensations without them being part of your self–image.
</li><li><b>Sensation Exploration</b>: Encourage curiosity about the nature of sensations such as color or pressure. Experience them as completely new and alien, free of all beliefs, assumptions, and thoughts, questioning their very existence and reason for being.
</li><li><b>Raw Fabric of Existence</b>: Contemplate the possibility of sensations existing without an observer, as free–floating experiences that form the raw fabric of existence. Investigate the idea of "you" being the sum total of all current sensations rather than an individual entity.
</li><li><b>Concept of Non–Entity</b>: Ponder the ability to exist as 'nothing', stripping away possessions, cultural influences, and even the notion of experiencing sensations. Ask, what remains if even the self–image is removed?
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Present Experience</b>: Accept reality as it is without filters, assumptions, or thoughts, even if uncomfortable, as this directly reflects existence.
</li><li><b>Contentment in Being</b>: Acknowledge the complete and calm contentment of just existing in the present moment, secure and at ease without needing external additions or identities.
</li><li><b>Guided Meditation to No–Self</b>: Follow a guided meditation aiming to lead to the experience of 'no–self', where individual identity merges with existence, free from thoughts, emotions, and attachments.
</li><li><b>Reiteration of No–Self Experience</b>: If distractions occur, repeat the exercise to reach a calm state, described as 'no–self', where the distinction between self and the external world blurs or disappears.
</li><li><b>Identity as the Invisible Man</b>: Consider the analogy of the Invisible Man who adorns garments to create visible identity and question what constitutes your essential nature once stripped of these external elements. Explore existential identity beyond physical and intangible attributes through introspection.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Deep Self–Inquiry</b>: Leo leaves viewers with a profound question about the essential nature of existence, urging them to discover their true selves not through intellect or beliefs but through radical, honest introspection into what really exists within.
