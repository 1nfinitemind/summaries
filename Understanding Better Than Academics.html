            <ul>
    <li><b>Experiment with vlog style</b>: Leo is trying an informal vlog format to share his non–linear, rapid, and intuitive thought processes that are difficult to convey in structured videos.
</li><li><b>Intuition versus logic</b>: He describes his intuitive thinking as a vast neural net that allows for simultaneous processing of many ideas, unlike the clear and precise, but linear nature of logic.
</li><li><b>Communication struggles</b>: Leo admits to the communication challenge presented by his intuition–driven insights, expressing the difficulty in convincing others without a linear argument structure.
</li><li><b>Content prioritization dilemma</b>: With a limit of one video per week, Leo must prioritize which topics to include, leaving many insights unshared due to the constraint of releasing only about 50 videos a year.
</li><li><b>Vision for actualized.org</b>: Leo hints at the deep and far–reaching potential of his work with actualized.org and the long–term commitment required from followers to realize the full benefits.
</li><li><b>Long–term strategic thinking</b>: He promotes long–term strategic thinking as part of being successful in life and overcoming short–term setbacks and lack of vision.
</li><li><b>Expert knowledge through commitment</b>: Leo promises viewers profound understanding surpassing top academics in various fields if they commit to watching his content and doing the work for several years.
</li><li><b>Open–mindedness as a knowledge key</b>: He emphasizes radical open–mindedness as the key to profound knowledge, which he claims is often underestimated and lacking in academia and general society.
</li><li><b>Challenges of maintaining openness</b>: Leo discusses the difficulty of remaining open–minded enough to fully embrace and comprehend reality, which requires a radical and unbiased approach.
</li><li><b>Transformation via deep engagement</b>: Stresses the life–changing potential of deeply engaging with radical ideas about reality, which can lead to a transformative shift in understanding and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Resistance to change</b>: He observes that many people resist change, preferring to defend existing belief systems, which inhibits the deep understanding he advocates for.
</li><li><b>Limitations of the academic system</b>: Leo talks about the cultural constraints within academia that indoctrinate PhDs and prevent them from adopting maverick or radically open–minded positions due to the need for approval and adherence to established paradigms.
</li><li><b>Academic marginalization</b>: He mentions how institutions isolate mavericks by relegating them to less influential areas, such as the philosophy of religion, effectively neutralizing the threat their ideas might pose to established norms.
</li><li><b>Threatening nature of transformative ideas</b>: Leo notes how deeply transformative ideas can be perceived as a threat to social structures, relationships, and institutions, resulting in resistance to change.
</li><li><b>Academic career constraints</b>: Highlights the career and livelihood dependence on not challenging the status quo within academia, which discourages radical openness and innovation.
</li><li><b>Academic dependency and career limitations</b>: Academics are deeply invested in their institutions and face significant pressure to conform, compromising their ability to think outside the box due to dependence on salary, reputation, and incentives like tenure.
</li><li><b>Specialization and barrier to big–picture ideas</b>: Universities force researchers to focus on narrow, specialized subfields, making them more akin to technicians. This hyper–specialization obstructs the pursuit of broad, interconnected ideas and understanding.
</li><li><b>Corruption of truth in academia</b>: Leo observed the university system's corruption firsthand, watching philosophers prioritizing institutional bureaucracy over the true pursuit of wisdom, leading him to abandon the path of becoming an academic philosopher.
</li><li><b>Financial independence for uncorrupted truth</b>: Leo emphasizes that his ability to share unadulterated insights on actualized.org is underpinned by his financial independence from traditional employment, reputations, and external funding resources.
</li><li><b>Creative freedom from non–conformity</b>: Before actualized.org, Leo's commitment to financial and creative independence allowed him to escape the corrupting influences that plague professionals in academia and other creative fields.
</li><li><b>Balance of practical and metaphysical content</b>: Leo curates content for actualized.org that balances practical utility with his passion for metaphysical subjects, enabling him to maintain his creative independence and share his vision for understanding reality.
</li><li><b>Promise of deep understanding</b>: Leo believes that following his guidance on actualized.org over the course of several years can lead to a profound understanding of reality that surpasses the knowledge of the most adept academics.
</li><li><b>Deep curiosity for truth</b>: Leo stresses the importance of seeking truth for its own sake, highlighting that all life decisions hinge on our understanding of reality. Without truth, we can't be confident in the validity of our actions or life choices.
</li><li><b>Human capacity for understanding</b>: Emphasizing humanity's unique ability to reflect and comprehend, Leo places high value on philosophy and science as means to explore the fundamental questions of existence.
</li><li><b>Importance of open–mindedness</b>: Leo criticizes the limitations of strict beliefs and encourages a genuine curiosity that leads to undertaking serious research across various fields of knowledge.
</li><li><b>Life as a great privilege</b>: Viewing the pursuit of understanding reality not as an obligation but as a privilege, Leo finds fulfillment in the intellectual exploration of life's fundamental aspects.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of reality</b>: Leo describes his admiration for the intricate interconnectedness of all elements in reality, leading to a deeper appreciation for existence and an experience of life akin to witnessing a masterpiece.
</li><li><b>Enriching daily life through curiosity</b>: He encourages finding unconditional love and satisfaction in both positive and negative aspects of life, leading to a more magical, childlike wonder in everyday experiences.
</li><li><b>Crafting a holistic vision for one's life</b>: Leo discusses the importance of taking the time to craft a meaningful life through planning, vision, and correcting past mistakes, asserting that it's never too late to reshape one's life path.
</li><li><b>Value of long–term vision</b>: Working towards a meaningful, long–term goal provides a sense of relief and purpose compared to the monotony of a typical nine–to–five job.
</li><li><b>Liberation through correction</b>: Acknowledging and correcting past mistakes is difficult but ultimately liberating, as it allows a person to work towards a larger, more conscious life vision.
</li><li><b>Conscious life construction</b>: Piece by piece, one can construct a conscious life by focusing on personal development, aligning with like–minded individuals who support growth, and minimizing distractions.
</li><li><b>The importance of vision and trust</b>: Keeping the vision of a profound understanding of life in mind is crucial, and trusting the process is essential–even though life decisions are inherently gambles.
</li><li><b>Radical open–mindedness as a principle</b>: True open–mindedness involves not taking a fixed position on any issue and trusting that this approach will lead to positive insights and understanding.
</li><li><b>Pursuing truth as a noble endeavor</b>: Centering life around the pursuit of truth, and being genuinely curious about it, is a rare approach that can yield interesting and strategic life developments.
</li><li><b>Power of big–picture understanding</b>: Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of life by connecting different areas of knowledge confers a unique confidence and strategic advantage.
</li><li><b>Radical ownership of life</b>: Taking full ownership of all aspects of life, including finances, information consumption, and personal growth, avoids societal corruption and empowers individual choices.
</li><li><b>Trusting resonance in consciousness work</b>: Trusting the intuition that resonates with profound, truthful, and high–consciousness content is key to aligning with transformative ideas.
</li><li><b>Long–term self–actualization as an investment</b>: Self–actualization is a process of connecting knowledge dots, which initially may not yield visible results but gradually leads to a deeper understanding of life.
