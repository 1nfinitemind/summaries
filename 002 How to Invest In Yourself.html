        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/C1QYF5WYzCo' target='_blank'>How to Invest In Yourself</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Importance of long-term investment mindset</strong> : Leo advises against short-term investment mindset which often leads to dabbling and jumping from one thing to another, while having a long-term investment mindset is beneficial for lasting success in various aspects of life, including career, personal growth, fitness, and relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Investment in career through built-up skills</strong> : Using career as an example, Leo elucidates that investing in one's career by continuously improving and leveraging valuable skills grants more career success and satisfaction. He implies that the key to becoming wealthy and successful lies in building and expanding one's knowledge and skills that are valuable to others. </li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Skill Development</strong> : Leo emphasizes that time should be spent on improving one's skills and gathering experience germane to one's work. This not only makes an individual a valuable asset to others in the long run but also is the most sustainable path to becoming rich and successful. </li>
<li><strong>The concept of 'inner game' or soft skills</strong> : Beyond specific technical skills, Leo highlights the importance of working on 'inner game' or 'soft skills' including people skills, wit, humor, business acumen, and political savvy, which he argues might be even more crucial for success. </li>
<li><strong>Creativity and Originality</strong> : Leo discusses the significance of creativity and originality, particularly for artists. He suggests acknowledging and addressing any blocks or challenges that might be holding you back and exploring new ways to enhance and connect with your inherent creative abilities. </li>
<li><strong>Problems with short-term gains</strong> : Leo warns about the pitfalls of focusing on short-term gains versus long-term ones. He encourages viewers to weigh the pros and cons of each and underscores that focusing on long-term investment could potentially harvest bigger success and financial rewards. </li>
<li><strong>The Value of Brain-building</strong> : Leo argues that becoming wealthy and successful comes from 'building your brain', i.e., accumulating knowledge and skills that are valuable to others. With the growing demand for service and information provision in modern society, he highlights the escalating need for skill development. </li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Creativity and Overcoming Blocks</strong> : Leo speaks about the necessity of structuring one's life around creativity for more creative thinking throughout the day. He emphasizes the importance of resolving limiting beliefs or blocks that may prevent individuals, especially artists, from achieving success. This task may involve identifying challenges and breaking down the action plan into digestible steps. </li>
<li><strong>Building Confidence and Expressing Creativity</strong> : According to Leo, gaining confidence in expressive creativity involves concrete steps such as producing unconventional art, seeking feedback, mentally preparing oneself to step outside their comfort zone, and continually expanding this realm of comfort. This strategy, he notes, can apply to various aspects of life beyond art, such as weight loss, business, personal development, and relationship goals. </li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Change versus Underlying Issue Resolution</strong> : Leo makes a distinction between behavioral change and addressing underlying issues. He suggests that changes in behavior might not provide sustainable results unless the deeper problems are resolved. In this context, he emphasizes the critical aspect of one's thinking and perspective towards activities and contributions to overall success. </li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment Case Study in Marketing</strong> : Leo provides a personal example of how a long-term investment mindset played out during his stint as an internet marketer, specifically in the SEO field. He analogizes backlinks to value like diamonds, understanding that each link could bring significant revenue as it collectively contributes towards ranking the website high on search engines. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional Stability and Its Long-Term Impact</strong> : Leo advocates self-investment through activities that bolster emotional stability, specifying the long-term benefits such endeavors can bring about. There are immediate and indirect impacts on various areas of life, like work, relationships, and personal development. The resulting improvements&mdash;better work communication, lesser fights in relationships, deeper connections, increased focus, and resilience&mdash;though intangible, are invaluable in Leo's perspective. </li>
<li><strong>Future Discussions on Outer and Inner Game</strong> : As the video concludes, he indicates his intention to delve into the subjects of 'outer' and 'inner' game in future discussions, highlighting how coaching can aid these development areas.</li>
