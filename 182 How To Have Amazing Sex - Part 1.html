            <ul>
    <li><b>Guide for men about amazing sex</b>: Leo emphasizes that this video focuses on a guide for men. Leo asserts that in the sexual dynamic, typically, the man leads and therefore, a substantial portion of the sexual experience depends on his actions and leadership in the bedroom.
</li><li><b>90% of amazing sex dependent on the man</b>: Leo argues that approximately 90% of what makes sex amazing is related to what the man does. Men who have never had mind–blowing sex are missing out on a critical life experience.
</li><li><b>Sex as a peak life experience</b>: He frames amazing sex as one of the best peak life experiences anyone can have, comparing it to breathtaking natural wonders like the Grand Canyon.
</li><li><b>Men's performance in the bedroom</b>: Leo criticizes how poorly he perceives most men to perform in the bedroom, observing that many men and women are missing out on truly fulfilling sexual experiences.
</li><li><b>Sexual satisfaction and relationship loyalty</b>: Leo suggests that extraordinary sex can deeply bind a woman to a man, reducing worries about loyalty and infidelity in a relationship. However, he cautions against manipulating women through sex.
</li><li><b>Mindset over technique</b>: Leo emphasizes that mindset is more crucial than mechanical techniques during sex. Men should have an eagerness to please their partners authentically and intensely as an expression of masculine energy.
</li><li><b>Emotional openness and vulnerability</b>: He stresses the importance of being emotionally open, vulnerable, and unselfconscious during sex, despite potential past traumas or the perception of stoicism as masculine.
</li><li><b>Women's emotional connection to sex</b>: Leo points out that for women, the sexual experience is heavily rooted in emotion, and not so much in the physical aspects like penis size. He tells men they need to connect emotionally while also being dominant.
</li><li><b>Flow state and being present during sex</b>: Leo describes sex as a flow state experience where one should be fully immersed and present, advocating for a focus on the activity rather than being caught up in one's thoughts. 
</li><li><b>Enjoyment of pleasing the partner</b>: Leo wants men to view the bedroom as a place where they can enjoy giving pleasure more than just aiming for personal satisfaction, setting a standard of excellence for themselves as lovers.
</li><li><b>Foundation of Amazing Sex</b>: Leo stresses the importance of understanding the foundation of amazing sex which transcends physical attributes like penis size. It's essential to focus on emotional aspects rather than purely visual and mechanical features.
</li><li><b>A Woman's Deepest Fantasy</b>: A key point Leo makes is that a woman's deepest fantasy is to experience deep emotional intimacy with her chosen man. This intimacy involves a connection that is not just physical but also deeply emotional.
</li><li><b>Significance of Emotional Penetration</b>: For women, the emotional penetration is even more significant than physical penetration. Leo elaborates on the importance of the man's personality and emotional connection in the sexual experience.
</li><li><b>Polar Dynamics of Masculine and Feminine</b>: Leo discusses the tension created by polar dynamics where the masculine aspect is seen as penetrating and the feminine aspect as absorbing and surrendering. 
</li><li><b>Pillars of Amazing Sex – Intimacy and Dominance</b>: He identifies two critical components–intimacy and dominance. While intimacy involves creating a close emotional connection, dominance involves asserting oneself in a masculine way.
</li><li><b>Role–Playing and Kink</b>: Leo briefly mentions role–playing and kinky sex but clarifies that his focus is on more traditional, vanilla sex, which he believes applies to the majority of heterosexual, male–dominant/female–submissive dynamics.
</li><li><b>Personal Hygiene Before Sex</b>: Emphasizing cleanliness, Leo advises men to groom themselves, including trimming body hair and ensuring they smell pleasant, which he notes is very important to women.
</li><li><b>Availability and Use of Condoms</b>: Stressing safe sex practices, Leo suggests keeping condoms easily accessible and carrying not just one but two condoms for unexpected situations or repeat encounters.
</li><li><b>Sex Is Not About 'Blowing Your Load'</b>: Leo encourages shifting the focus from male ejaculation to the pleasure and emotional experience of the woman, taking a mindset of sharing and loving to please her.
</li><li><b>Slowing Down and Foreplay</b>: He advises men to slow down and engage in extended foreplay, including kissing and touching, to build arousal and anticipation.
</li><li><b>Variety in Sexual Encounters</b>: While giving a basic blueprint for sex, Leo also encourages personal expression and variation, suggesting experimentation within the sexual experience.
</li><li><b>Building Anticipation with Stomach–to–Stomach Contact</b>: As Leo continues kissing, a unique move he suggests is lifting both his and her shirts to expose their stomachs and press them together. This intimate act creates warmth and a sense of connection while still clothed, simulating a closeness akin to penetration and enhancing her anticipation for what's to come.
</li><li><b>Intimate and Dominant Eye Contact</b>: Maintaining eye contact during sex is crucial. Leo differentiates between seductive, intimate looks that communicate adoration and dominant looks that signal a strong sexual desire. This variety in gaze conveys trust, safety, and connection without worded assurance.
</li><li><b>Strategic Disrobing and Leading to the Bedroom</b>: Leo advises on slow, deliberate disrobing, where taking off shirts or leading by the hand to the bedroom asserts a commanding presence. It's a way for men to show dominance reassuringly, signaling to the woman that she is being led to a pleasurable experience.
</li><li><b>Escalating Erotic Touch without Direct Stimulation</b>: Leo suggests avoiding the vagina and nipples initially to build tension. He promotes starting with non–sexual body parts and progressing slowly to more sensitive areas. This gradual build–up involves various sensual techniques such as using fingertips, blowing on wet skin, and varying the intensity of touch to peak her excitement.
</li><li><b>Advanced Fingertip Stimulation</b>: Utilizing fingertips for gentle caresses and scratches can enhance the sensual experience. Leo emphasizes starting with light touch, such as grazing the hairs on her skin, then moving to deeper pressure, which intensifies the intimacy as arousal grows.
</li><li><b>Implementing Dirty Talk</b>: Leo sees dirty talk as an essential element, starting during the make–out phase and continuing through the encounter. Varying from intimate to dominant expressions, dirty talk can range from expressions of love to explicit statements, setting the scene for what's to come and heightening the excitement.
</li><li><b>Dirty Talk to Build Intimacy</b>: Leo discusses how dirty talk can enhance the intimate connection; it includes giving dominant commands, describing explicit sexual actions, and using graphic detail or innuendo.
</li><li><b>Teasing Techniques</b>: Leo describes teasing as an essential part of foreplay, exemplified by stimulating a woman's nipple with a wet fingertip without directly touching it, then blowing on it to heighten arousal.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Taking Your Time</b>: Leo advises that sexual encounters should last between 60 minutes to 2 hours to ensure sufficient arousal and enjoyment, as anything shorter than 60 minutes is too rushed for quality sex.
</li><li><b>Increasing Anticipation</b>: By teasing and requiring the woman to beg for more, Leo creates a dynamic where the woman's desire intensifies, enhancing the sexual experience once the anticipated action, like fingering, occurs.
</li><li><b>Fingering Technique</b>: Leo emphasizes the technique of starting with rubbing around the vagina before penetrating with fingers, using the pad of the finger to rub around and gently press on the opening before entering.
</li><li><b>Connection During Fingering</b>: While fingering, Leo maintains eye contact with the woman to build an intimate connection, ensuring the focus is on her reaction not just the physical action.
</li><li><b>Stimulating the G–spot</b>: Leo describes how to locate and stimulate the G–spot with a finger to significantly enhance pleasure.
</li><li><b>Multiple Orgasms Before Penetration</b>: Before penetrating with his penis, Leo aims to make the woman orgasm at least once or twice using his fingers, believing this takes pressure off the man and ensures the woman's satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Having Sex and Positioning</b>: Leo encourages trying different positions to delay the man's orgasm and maintain the woman's arousal, emphasizing eye contact in positions like missionary and dominance in positions like doggy style.
</li><li><b>Prolonging the Sexual Experience</b>: Leo suggests techniques for managing one's own arousal to avoid premature ejaculation and maximize the duration of the sexual encounter.
</li><li><b>Climax and Synchronization</b>: Sexual climax is most intense when the man ejaculates inside the woman, usually causing her to orgasm due to the synchronization of pleasure.
</li><li><b>Prolonging the sexual experience</b>: Leo discusses techniques for men to prolong penetration and maximize pleasure for women without reaching climax too quickly. He suggests experimenting with positions and angles that feel good for her yet allow the man greater control over his own arousal.
</li><li><b>Engagement during sex</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of engaging with the woman during sex through dirty talk, including expressions of intimacy and dominance. He suggests telling her how much you desire her, and if in a loving relationship, expressing love verbally.
</li><li><b>Post–sex intimacy</b>: Stressing the aftercare, Leo points out that post–sex intimacy like cuddling and appreciation can foster a deep emotional connection and make the woman fall in love, heightening loyalty.
</li><li><b>Integrating lovey–dovey behavior post–sex</b>: He encourages indulging in affectionate behavior after sex, such as looking into her eyes with love, caressing, and cuddling, as it can be as satisfying as the sex itself and strengthens the bond.
</li><li><b>Application of sex techniques</b>: Leo advises focusing on three principles: the pleasure of pleasing the partner, exuding masculinity, and striving for sexual excellence. These mindsets help the techniques fall into place more naturally.
</li><li><b>Educating oneself on sex</b>: Leo suggests reading books, enrolling in online courses, and watching educational porn to learn effective sex techniques. The key is to approach these resources with the intent to learn and improve.
</li><li><b>Porn as a learning tool</b>: Differentiating between helpful and unhelpful porn, Leo advises using porn to learn new techniques and to find inspiration to enhance your sexual routine.
</li><li><b>Incremental improvement</b>: Leo recommends gradually incorporating new techniques into your sex life, rather than trying everything at once. Start with basics and add elements like dirty talk or spanking over time for steady improvement.
</li><li><b>Building skills through practice</b>: Frequent and consistent practice with a regular partner, like a girlfriend, is suggested over one–night stands for developing sexual skills and deepening intimacy.
</li><li><b>Using feedback loops to improve</b>: Leo emphasizes the value of revisiting educational material before each sexual encounter and applying one new piece of learning to continuously improve sexual expertise.
</li><li><b>Encouraging open dialogue about sex</b>: He concludes by encouraging viewers to discuss sex openly, share educational resources, and pursue a dedicated learning journey to become proficient in providing deep, emotional, and satisfying sex.
