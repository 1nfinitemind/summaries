        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5IVEKz4jYmA' target='_blank'>The Highest Hero's Journey - What It Means To Be Real Hero</a></h1>
        <p><em>"A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than<br />
oneself." - Joseph Campbell</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding the Highest Hero's Journey</strong> : Leo delves into a more significant dimension of the hero's journey, exploring its interconnections with spirituality and non-duality, contrasting with his earlier practical take on the concept tailored to finding one's purpose and societal impact. </li>
<li><strong>Different Life Paths Explored</strong> : Before establishing Actualized.org, Leo considered becoming a science fiction writer, leading him to study narrative structures, storytelling, character, and the psychology of villains&mdash;a journey that ultimately directed him toward personal development and understanding human psychology. </li>
<li><strong>Studying Influences on Star Wars</strong> : Research into the creation of Star Wars, an influential franchise that inspired him, led Leo to explore its origins in Flash Gordon and Valerian comics, the latter offering a distinctive European French style influencing cinema. </li>
<li><strong>Joseph Campbell and the Hero's Journey Concept</strong> : Joseph Campbell, the American mythologist who popularized and made explicit the concept of the hero's journey, which illustrates a schematic outline of human life, was a key figure Leo studied. </li>
<li><strong>Starting the Hero's Journey</strong> : The journey begins with the hero leading an ordinary, comfortable life. A call to adventure is presented, which invokes fear and resistance due to the human tendency toward homeostasis and aversion to risk. </li>
<li><strong>Forced Acceptance of Adventure</strong> : Despite initial refusal, the hero is coerced into accepting the journey through dramatic changes or loss (e.g., Luke Skywalker's family and home being destroyed), thus pushing the hero into unknown and risky territories. </li>
<li><strong>Facing Threshold Guardians and Seeking Mentorship</strong> : The hero encounters Threshold Guardians, which test their resolve. Upon failure, the hero seeks out a mentor&mdash;a past hero who imparts wisdom, training, and often provides a crucial tool for the journey ahead. </li>
<li><strong>The Significance of the Mentor</strong> : Mentors play a vital role as they are themselves experienced heroes from a previous generation, ready to guide new heroes through trials with advice and skills training. </li>
<li><strong>The Final Boss and the Dragon</strong> : The hero must prepare to face the final boss or dragon, which guards the coveted Holy Grail. Initial defeat is typical, leading to a retreat for reevaluation and self-confrontation before the hero can succeed. </li>
<li><strong>Entering the Belly of the Whale and Inner Reflection</strong> : Facing failure, the hero enters a phase of deep inner reflection known as "entering the belly of the whale", where they must confront their own inner demons and weaknesses, realizing that these internal barriers are what truly hold them back from success. </li>
<li><strong>The Hero's Inner Battle</strong> : The final boss in the hero's journey is the hero's own inner demons, weaknesses, and fears. The struggle with these personal challenges is the most difficult part of the journey. </li>
<li><strong>Revelation upon Obtaining the Holy Grail</strong> : Upon obtaining the Holy Grail, the hero experiences a reversal in understanding; the journey's value lies in the transformation and personal growth achieved, not in the physical prize. </li>
<li><strong>The Physical Grail vs. Self-Discovery</strong> : The hero realizes that the true Holy Grail is the discovery of oneself, not a material treasure. This revelation leads to a sense of peace and happiness derived from personal evolution. </li>
<li><strong>Return to the Tribe with Knowledge</strong> : The hero returns home to share the lessons learned, but the tribe is unable to comprehend the value of the journey as they have not experienced it themselves. </li>
<li><strong>The Hero as Mentor</strong> : The returning hero stands as a mentor, ready to guide new heroes who choose to embark on their journey, although few are willing to leave comfort for the call to adventure. </li>
<li><strong>Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey</strong> : Joseph Campbell formulated the hero's journey after studying global mythological traditions, finding consistent patterns across different cultures. </li>
<li><strong>The Hero's Journey as Human Life Structure</strong> : The lecture affirms that the hero's journey's structure represents the framework of human life and is essential to understanding one's existence. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of External Journeys</strong> : Many perceive the external journeys in pop culture as literal, but these are actually metaphors for the internal pursuit of consciousness and enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Derived from Vedanta Philosophy</strong> : The core of the hero's journey is derived from Vedanta&mdash;a Hindu non-dualistic tradition focused on the pursuit of enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>The Choice between Ego and Truth</strong> : Human life and the hero's journey are about choosing between serving one's ego or pursuing the absolute truth, with heroes choosing the latter. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding Evil</strong> : Evil is characterized as intrinsic selfishness or ego, not as an external monster; the villain symbolizes the ego-serving status quo. </li>
<li><strong>Holy Grail&rsquo;s Symbolism</strong> : The Holy Grail represents intangible concepts like truth, God, enlightenment, or consciousness, which cannot be exploited for materialistic power. </li>
<li><strong>Villain's Disregard for the Truth</strong> : Villains seek power instead of truth, striving to maintain the ego-centric status quo and consciously rejecting enlightenment. </li>
<li><strong>Journey Misconception</strong> : Many people mistake the hero's journey for a materialistic quest and miss the opportunity to embark on a true inner spiritual journey. </li>
<li><strong>Materialistic Path as a Villain's Journey</strong> : Pursuit of materialistic goals, like wealth or career success, is a trap and misconception of the hero's journey, leading one to embody villainy rather than heroism. </li>
<li><strong>Enablement of Villainy</strong> : Many people are not strictly heroes or villains but enablers of villainy due to unconsciousness and selfish tendencies, functioning as minions and opposing true heroes. </li>
<li><strong>Refusal of the Hero's Call</strong> : The lecture states that most individuals unconsciously refuse the call to a deep inner spiritual journey, misunderstanding it as a materialistic pursuit and not recognizing it for the transformative journey it is. </li>
<li><strong>Mistaken Identity of Heroes</strong> : Leo points out that society often misidentifies athletes, celebrities, tycoons, and politicians as heroes, whereas real heroes are spiritual figures such as Zen masters and mystics who undertake true inner journeys and find humility in the Holy Grail. </li>
<li><strong>Heroes as Rare Phenomena</strong> : Heroes are rare because their journey entails a break from personal loyalty and pragmatism, which goes against society's collective conspiracy to serve the self. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Sacrifice in the Hero's Journey</strong> : Accepting the call to adventure often leads to social isolation and demonization because it violates the societal norm of self-service. </li>
<li><strong>The Call to Adventure and Romanticism</strong> : Accepting the hero's call requires romanticism and risk-taking due to inherent uncertainty, as pragmatic thinking and a list of pros and cons would discourage the journey. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural and Visionary Obstacles</strong> : Societal intoxication and lack of vision hinder most people from accepting the call, as they are unable to visualize the Holy Grail, and peer pressure dissuades them from taking risks. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional Impact of Heroes</strong> : Heroes inspire and evoke emotion because they reveal the highest potential within us and the profound inner journey we ought to undertake. </li>
<li><strong>Inevitable Struggle on the Hero's Path</strong> : Heroes must struggle not only because of opposition by the status quo but also due to the internal battle of coming to terms with one's self, which is the scariest and most confusing aspect. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to the Heroes' Wisdom</strong> : The tribe cannot immediately grasp the hero's lessons upon return because true understanding requires personal experience, not simply intellectual knowledge. </li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of the Hero's Lessons</strong> : Reading about a hero's experiences in a book isn't enough to understand their teachings. Dismissing their struggles leads people to continue in their mundane, ego-driven activities, missing the actual journey the hero undertook. </li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of Symbolizing the Holy Grail</strong> : The Holy Grail's true essence cannot be communicated through symbols, language, or scientific analysis. This emphasizes the non-symbolic and experiential nature of the truth that one seeks through the hero's journey. </li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Life</strong> : Leo underscores that life's purpose isn't mundane success or pleasure but rather the pursuit of reality's truth, which equates to the Holy Grail. </li>
<li><strong>Experiential Learning Through Hardship</strong> : The School of Hard Knocks is Leo's analogy for learning life's truths&mdash;these lessons cannot be outsourced or taught; they must be experienced personally to be fully comprehended. </li>
<li><strong>The Hermit Mentor</strong> : Mentors who have grasped the Holy Grail become hermits, not due to misanthropy, but because they've transcended the ego-driven societal game and know the Grail cannot simply be given to others. </li>
<li><strong>The Hero's Journey as a Framework</strong> : Leo advises using the hero's journey as a blueprint, a process which, when understood, can help navigate through life's difficult phases and maintain resolve. </li>
<li><strong>Accepting the Call to Adventure</strong> : Emphasizing the critical step of accepting the hero's journey, Leo states that it involves emotional labor, sacrifice, and the readiness to pursue true meaning. </li>
<li><strong>Dedication to a Greater Cause</strong> : The deepest fulfillment comes from giving oneself to a cause beyond personal gain, which often requires overcoming societal pressures and carving out a unique path. </li>
<li><strong>Zen Master Ryokan's Haiku</strong> : The journey's solitary and arduous nature is encapsulated by a haiku from a true hero, Ryokan, which parallels the hero's solitary return after fulfilling their mission. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The village has disappeared in the evening mist<br />
And the path is hard to follow.<br />
Walking through the pines,<br />
I return to my lonely hut.</em></p>
<p><em>-Ryokan</em></p>
