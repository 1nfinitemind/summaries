            <ul>
    <li><b>Existence of Trauma</b>: Leo acknowledges that everyone has memories from the past that are painful or traumatic which can contribute to ongoing fear, anxiety, and hinder current performance.
</li><li><b>Letting Go is Possible</b>: Leo stresses that irrespective of the severity of past trauma, letting go is achievable. The ability to release these memories is within one's psychological capability.
</li><li><b>Psychoemotional Impact of Past Events</b>: Holding onto negative past experiences is pointless and detrimental to present functioning. These experiences are not contributing anything beneficial but are instead causing harm.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Nature of the Past</b>: The past is explained as a concept rather than present reality. Emphasizing the distinction between actual current experiences and recollections that only exist conceptually.
</li><li><b>Conceptualization vs. Reality</b>: Leo delineates between what's real and conceptual, such as the stark difference between present experiences and the conceptualized past or anticipated future.
</li><li><b>Present Moment Awareness</b>: An exercise is provided to foster awareness of the present moment by focusing on bodily sensations and the act of breathing, which anchors one in the reality of the 'now'.
</li><li><b>Releasing the Past through Imagination</b>: In the guided exercise, Leo instructs viewers to visualize a reality where the past and future don't exist, to experience being fully immersed in the present without the weight of past experiences.
</li><li><b>The Exercise's Effects</b>: The experience of the meditation is posited as an illustration of how living in the moment feels and offers a contrast to being absorbed by past or future thoughts.
</li><li><b>Limiting Beliefs and Letting Go</b>: Leo recognizes that despite understanding the past isn't literally real, it still affects individuals. He emphasizes that the belief one cannot let go contributes to the past's persistence and that choosing to stop thinking about the past is the key to letting it go.
</li><li><b>Rehearsing the Past</b>: Leo explains that the past continues to exist because we keep thinking about it. The act of mentally rehearsing past events keeps them alive, and to eliminate them, one must simply decide to let go.
</li><li><b>Therapy and Introspection</b>: While advocating to let go of the past, Leo encourages therapy and introspection to understand and learn from past experiences, which he practices both personally and in his coaching sessions.
</li><li><b>Irreversibility of the Past</b>: He argues that worrying about past events is futile as it won't prevent future mistakes and might lead to a self–fulfilling prophecy, exacerbating the issue one is worried about.
</li><li><b>Positive Distractions as a Solution</b>: Leo suggests having a positive goal or vision for the future as a means to distract oneself from ruminating on past events, such as envisioning a new relationship or personal growth.
</li><li><b>Designing a Busy Life</b>: He shares his personal approach to avoiding dwelling on the past, which involves being too occupied with the present and planning for the future to have time for past regrets.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org Resources</b>: In conclusion, Leo promotes the Actualized.org newsletter, indicating that it provides valuable resources for mastering psychology, introspection, and specific techniques for letting go of the past, including a 19–part video series on eliminating limiting beliefs and an opportunity to win free coaching sessions.
