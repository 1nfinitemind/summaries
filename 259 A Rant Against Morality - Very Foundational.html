        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/RLqFrF-QTCI' target='_blank'>A Rant Against Morality - Very Foundational</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Leo Gura's foundational view of morality</strong> : Leo emphasizes that conventional models of morality, consisting of what is deemed right or wrong, good or evil, actually inhibit personal growth and fulfillment by fostering unconscious obedience to external rules and internalized judgments. </li>
<li><strong>Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development</strong> : Leo introduces Kohlberg's three stages of moral development: preconventional, conventional, and post-conventional, which outline the evolution of moral reasoning from basic punishment/reward principles to internalized principles. Leo adds a fourth stage, transcendent morality, characterized by a conscious realization of unity and unconditional love for all aspects of existence. </li>
<li><strong>Problems with traditional morality</strong> : He criticizes traditional morality for promoting moralism – a black-and-white, dogmatic view of reality, which applies to both religious and secular individuals and ideologies and tends to cause suffering by fragmenting one's perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Sources and examples of moralization</strong> : Leo gives examples of moralization from various sources such as religions, political ideologies, and family dynamics, pointing out that it affects interpersonal relationships and social interactions through the imposition of cultural etiquette and rules. </li>
<li><strong>The challenge of profound moral transformation</strong> : The transition to transcendent morality, which Leo argues for, requires abandoning judgmental views and accepting reality as it is, but is typically resisted because it is counterintuitive and requires a significant evolution of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Belief-induced Suffering</strong> : Holding rigid beliefs such as "nobody is supposed to ever cut me off in traffic" can lead to personal suffering due to resultant anger when expectations are not met. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Moralization</strong> : Leo discusses the internal rules created during adolescent growth and how these benchmarks lead to self-judgment as well as judgment of others' actions. </li>
<li><strong>Problems with Moralism</strong> : Leo identifies the issues with moralism as its mechanical and unconscious nature, where life is expected to follow oversimplified rules, often leading to immoral outcomes in complex real-life situations. </li>
<li><strong>Conscious Morality versus Mechanical Rules</strong> : True morality, according to Leo, should arise from a conscious awareness of the situation rather than blind adherence to fixed rules which may not suit every context. </li>
<li><strong>Ego and Fear-Based Morality</strong> : Morality models are often fear-driven and constructed to defend an ego's identity, which creates a rigid and fragmented sense of self. </li>
<li><strong>Parental and Societal Morality Indoctrination</strong> : From early childhood, rules about right and wrong are deeply imprinted on individuals by parents and society, influencing foundational perceptions of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic Motivation and Integrity</strong> : External rules can cause a fragmented sense of motivation and self, where actions are obligated not by desire but by fear of punishment or societal norms, resulting in psychological neurosis. </li>
<li><strong>Ego and its Shadow</strong> : Leo explains the shadow aspect of the ego&mdash;denied parts of oneself&mdash;which leads to hypocrisy and denial of reality, causing life issues as reality ultimately asserts itself. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Righteousness Derived from Moralizing</strong> : Those who moralize frequently experience a secret ego-driven pleasure in their perceived righteousness, while judgment and denial of reality lead to inevitable loss and suffering when confronted with the true state of things. </li>
<li><strong>Pleasure Derived from Moralizing</strong> : Leo discusses how individuals experience ego gratification through moralizing, feeling self-righteous when condemning actions or people deemed morally inferior. This moral indignation inflates the ego's sense of superiority and self-worth. </li>
<li><strong>Hypocrisy Exacerbated by Moralism</strong> : Leo points out that moralizing often leads to hypocrisy, as exemplified by figures like corrupt preachers or politicians, whose public stances clash with their private indiscretions. Moralism can accelerate the very vices it denounces by causing individuals to hide and deny aspects of reality and parts of themselves. </li>
<li><strong>Negative Emotional Outcomes of Moralization</strong> : Moralizing results in feelings of guilt, shame, judgment, and self-hatred. Leo emphasizes that these feelings are not only directed towards others but are also self-inflicted, leading to a lack of integrity and self-esteem. </li>
<li><strong>Subtlety of Moralizing</strong> : Moralizing isn't just about overt judgments; Leo suggests that even small daily decisions or thoughts, such as feeling guilty about not going to the gym or judging a friend's behavior, are forms of moralization that deeply impact our psyche. </li>
<li><strong>Victimhood and Two Forms of Moralization</strong> : There are two forms of moralization – self-aggrandizing, where people tell others how to live, and self-victimizing, where they apply moralistic judgments to themselves. Both forms lead to a victim mentality and unnecessary suffering. </li>
<li><strong>Morality and Historical Atrocities</strong> : Leo links rigid adherence to moralistic rules with many atrocities throughout history. By demonizing individuals through judgment and moralization, societies have justified inhumane treatments and mass horrors. </li>
<li><strong>Transcendent Morality as Consciousness of Reality</strong> : Leo introduces transcendent morality – a pure consciousness of reality without the imposition of moral rules. He describes this as openness to being and existence devoid of judgments like "good" or "evil." </li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Reality</strong> : The core problem with moralization, according to Leo, is the rejection of reality. By failing to accept reality and attempting to fragment it into good and evil, we create suffering and societal chaos. </li>
<li><strong>Integrity as Opposite of Moralism</strong> : Integration of both light and dark aspects within oneself leads to wholeness and integrity. Leo argues that this unity allows for spontaneous and natural action without guilt or shame, transcending traditional moral paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Transcendent Morality versus Traditional Morality</strong> : Leo contrasts transcendent morality with traditional morality, which relies on external rules. He poses that religious moral codes stem from an understanding of transcendent morality, which is naturally aligned with being and existence, advocating for a shift towards embracing this deeper conception of morality. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of Traditional Morality</strong> : Leo suggests that historical figures like Jesus or Buddha would reject the rigid moral doctrines attributed to them if they witnessed the negative consequences those doctrines have fostered over time. </li>
<li><strong>Counterintuitiveness and Threat of Transcendent Morality</strong> : The concept of transcendent morality, which lacks externally imposed rules and is based on an acceptance of reality, may seem radical and threatening to mainstream thought because it challenges established notions of morality. </li>
<li><strong>Creation of Good and Evil</strong> : The concepts of good and evil are mental constructs introduced during childhood, serving as a utility for navigating life. However, the problem arises when these fictions, like lies, return to haunt the creator, leading to fragmentation and denial of reality's unity. </li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of 'Shoulds'</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the notion of 'should' is an illusion; what exists is precisely what should exist. This is a foundational concept, challenging to accept, that suggests the reality we experience is the only one that could be&mdash;without any alternative possibilities. </li>
<li><strong>Moral Narratives vs. Reality</strong> : Common moral statements asserting that certain things 'shouldn't exist', like crime, political factions, or behaviors, are in fact fantasies that do not impact actual reality. Accepting reality without these fantasies eliminates the perception of problems. </li>
<li><strong>Transcendent Morality and Judgment</strong> : In transcendent morality, one acknowledges the unity and reality of existence, leading to the realization that judgment of others, no matter the act, is rendered preposterous and a form of denial. </li>
<li><strong>Free Will Illusion</strong> : Accepting that there is no free will is integral to transcendent morality. Reality is a unified flow without alternative possibilities, thus what occurs is the only outcome that could've happened, reflecting total surrender to what is. </li>
<li><strong>Suffering from Control Struggle</strong> : Leo notes that the struggle for control over an uncontrollable reality is the root of suffering, stress, guilt, and victimhood. Acknowledgement of lack of control can lead to radical freedom. </li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Freedom Without Rules</strong> : The shift to a paradigm where anything is permissible is radical, especially for those accustomed to moralizing. However, for the consciously aware, no mechanical rules are necessary to dictate behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Leo&rsquo;s Personal Morality</strong> : Leo professes his moral and ethical behavior without the need for explicit moral rules. He posits that increasing one&rsquo;s consciousness allows one to tap into higher wisdom without needing external moral constraints. </li>
<li><strong>The Mystic's Experience and Rejection</strong> : Leo describes how mystics, who have transcended reality, have historically been ostracized or persecuted because their profound understanding and expression of morality often contrast with societal norms. </li>
<li><strong>Moral Responsibility and Consciousness</strong> : True morality, according to Leo, requires an individual to be deeply conscious and take full responsibility for their actions. This level of morality is self-managed rather than being enforced by external rules or societal pressures. </li>
<li><strong>Leo's Rejection of Fixed Morality Rules</strong> : Leo doesn't adhere to strict traditional rules like the Ten Commandments; instead, he practices a form of morality that doesn't rely on stringent rules against severe actions like murder or theft. </li>
<li><strong>Detachment from Standardized Morality</strong> : He finds it more liberating not to follow a codified morality, noting that he doesn't feel the temptation to commit heinous acts and rarely experiences anger, contrasting with the frequent anger he observes in others over minor provocations. </li>
<li><strong>The Rarity of Transcendent Morality</strong> : Leo acknowledges that transcendent morality is not mainstream due to the high level of consciousness and self-actualization work it requires, emphasizing that this approach is often counterintuitive and ego-threatening. </li>
<li><strong>Societal Rejection of Transcendent Morality</strong> : Transcendent morality is not publicly or politically promoted; Leo suggests that openly advocating such views could result in severe backlash or misunderstanding due to society's lack of advanced consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Handling Objections to Transcendent Morality</strong> : Leo addresses concerns regarding evil acts, stating that integration and understanding, not moralistic judgment, reduce "evil." He rejects calling actions evil as an arrogant ego judgment. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Reaction to Harm and Emotional Maturity</strong> : He admits he would be distressed by harm done to him or his family but would not demonize the perpetrator; instead, he aspires to view such events within the broader universal motion, as an indicator of emotional maturity. </li>
<li><strong>Advocacy of Self-actualization over Traditional Morality</strong> : Leo promotes transitioning to transcendent morality through self-actualization, encouraging listeners to consider that their current paradigms may not lead to further success and might need reassessment. </li>
<li><strong>True Morality Is Unconditional Love</strong> : He concludes by asserting that true morality stems from unconditional love for all reality without exceptions, challenging viewers to ponder the strength of a morality reliant on external rules or authorities. </li>
<li><strong>Promotion of Actualized.org</strong> : Leo invites viewers to engage with his content and announces an upcoming episode on practical approaches to overcoming the negative impacts of moralizing, which he believes will significantly enhance life quality.</li>
