        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/vJG8swAQYwc' target='_blank'>How Psychedelics Work - Making Sense Of Psychedelics</a></h1>
        <p><em>"Psychedelics don't work on stupid people." - Terrence McKenna</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose of the Episode</strong> : Leo intends to explain the mechanics, metaphysics, and epistemology of psychedelics, targeting those who have had psychedelic experiences without understanding them, possibly leaving them frightened or curious. </li>
<li><strong>Integration of Personal and Academic Background</strong> : Leo's approach to understanding psychedelics combines his four decades of existential, metaphysical, and epistemic contemplation with practical experimentation over several years. </li>
<li><strong>Diversity of Psychedelic Experiences</strong> : Having completed about 80 trips on various substances, Leo underscores the importance of exploring a range of psychedelics to grasp their profound effects truly. </li>
<li><strong>Challenging the Materialistic Paradigm</strong> : To understand psychedelics, Leo argues one must move beyond the conventional scientific perspective that views reality as materialistic and objective, proposing instead that consciousness is the basis for all reality. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic Hallucinations vs. Reality</strong> : Leo proposes that there is no distinction between sober reality and the hallucinations induced by psychedelics; both are a form of hallucination&mdash;appearance without material substance. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and the Nature of Consciousness</strong> : He clarifies that taking psychedelics is not about altering brain chemistry, but rather experiencing different facets of consciousness, which is the only true reality. </li>
<li><strong>Breaking Paradigms with Psychedelics</strong> : Leo emphasizes that the transformative power of psychedelics can force individuals to reconsider their entire worldview, a process that is often hindered by fear and resistance. </li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about Psychedelics</strong> : There is a widespread misunderstanding that psychedelic experiences are less trustworthy due to brain chemistry alterations; instead, Leo claims these experiences reveal the illusory nature of all reality, sober or not. </li>
<li><strong>Threat to Established Beliefs</strong> : The radical nature of psychedelics can be threatening to both scientists and spiritual figures, as these experiences have the potential to shatter deeply held beliefs and ideas about reality and self. </li>
<li><strong>Ordinary Rigid Flow of Consciousness</strong> : Our everyday experience of waking up, going to work, and interacting with the familiar world is a stable, structured hallucination that consciousness creates for us. This rigid flow is very much changeable, but most people have never experienced such a change. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics Altering Reality</strong> : Psychedelics possess the power to instantly change this rigid flow of consciousness, leading to an experience where one's reality starts to 'melt' around them. This can be shocking as it reveals that our normal life is just another form of hallucination, now broken for the first time. </li>
<li><strong>Breakthrough Experience with Psychedelics</strong> : A breakthrough experience is when the psychedelic experience is so intense that it completely recontextualizes one's previous understanding of life, showing that everything believed to be real (like personal history and physical reality) is actually imaginary. </li>
<li><strong>Recontextualizing Reality</strong> : The psychedelic experience is threatening and scary because it dismantles one's previous paradigm of reality, forcing a reevaluation of concepts such as earth, universe, and even personal identity, which can lead to negative stigma and defense mechanisms from the ego. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as a Flowing Hallucination</strong> : Consciousness is like a stream constantly changing shapes and forms; what psychedelics do is introduce alterations in this stream, which in turn affects the display of reality we experience. </li>
<li><strong>Consciousness Mixing Board Analogy</strong> : Imagine consciousness as an infinite-dimensional screen that can display anything. This screen is linked to a mixing board with various knobs regulating different aspects such as colors, sounds, and emotions, with one master knob for pure consciousness, or awareness itself. </li>
<li><strong>Master Knob of Pure Consciousness Awareness</strong> : This knob represents the level of awareness without altering the content of consciousness; tweaking this knob increases awareness and can lead to higher states of consciousness, from everyday alertness to states of "God consciousness" or omniscience. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics' Impact on Consciousness Knobs</strong> : Psychedelics not only tweak the master consciousness knob but also affect other aspects like colors and emotions, complicating the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Distraction by Minor Consciousness Knobs</strong> : People new to psychedelics may get sidetracked by altered visual or auditory content without recognizing that the central aspect of increased consciousness is the most profound part of the experience. </li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding Psychedelic State Changes</strong> : Criticism that discounts psychedelic experiences as mere temporary state changes overlooks the significance of observing the fluid nature of consciousness through these states. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as State Observation tools</strong> : The key value of psychedelic experiences is not just in the altered states but in the opportunity to understand and observe how consciousness can move between these states, offering deep insights into the nature of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Psychedelic Experiences</strong> : Psychedelics provide a meta understanding of consciousness by allowing one to experience and compare different states. This reveals the fluid nature of consciousness and underscores that reality is susceptible to change, which can be radical and eye-opening. </li>
<li><strong>Misperceptions of Reality</strong> : Many people, including spiritual teachers and enlightened individuals, underestimate the range of states consciousness can adopt. Psychedelics offer a perspective that magnifies possibilities beyond ordinary meditative practices. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation vs. Psychedelic Experience</strong> : Through meditation, one primarily engages the 'central knob' of consciousness, enhancing focus and potentially leading to enlightenment. Psychedelics, however, effortlessly and instantly reveal the existence of other 'knobs', allowing access to radical alterations in the perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Radical Knobs of Consciousness</strong> : Leo describes hypothetical consciousness 'knobs' that when 'twisted', could alter perception in dramatic ways, such as erasing distinctions between objects or reversing the flow of time&mdash;changes that defy conventional scientific understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Transformative Effects of Psychedelics</strong> : Leo notes that even temporary psychedelic experiences, such as seeing oneself as a beer bottle or an entire race, can profoundly change one's perspective on life. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Psychedelics on Life Perspective</strong> : Comparing psychedelic experiences to being transported to utterly different environments, Leo argues that these experiences expand one's notion of reality and can have a transformative effect akin to cultural or environmental shock. </li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Science in Understanding Reality</strong> : Leo critiques mainstream science for mapping only a narrow scope of reality&mdash;limited to a single state of consciousness&mdash;while ignoring the full spectrum of conscious experiences available. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics as Temporal Teachers</strong> : Psychedelic experiences are fleeting but profound, providing dense learning opportunities in a short period. The challenge lies in integrating a fraction of these insights into one's regular life to facilitate growth and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Integration and Growth Post-Psychedelic Experience</strong> : Post-trip contemplation is pivotal for making sense of the experience, as reflecting on the 'what the [ __ ] was that' moments aids in integrating the experience and expanding one's perception of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Extraction of Insights via Integration</strong> : Reflecting on and integrating psychedelic experiences allow an individual to bring back more learnings&mdash;up to 5% as opposed to 1%. Over the course of many trips, this can profoundly alter one's perspective of reality in beneficial ways. </li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Reality and Self-knowledge</strong> : Psychedelic trips don't just facilitate metaphysical exploration; they importantly enable deep self-inquiry into one's psyche, past, and life purpose. They shift the focus to understanding the self and existential questions through the central knob of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Tuning the Consciousness Knob</strong> : Adjusting consciousness can lead to heightened awareness across all facets of life. Psychedelics boost this consciousness, aiding insights into vast domains, including science, relationships, sexuality, and spirituality, among others. </li>
<li><strong>Risk of Self-Delusion</strong> : There's a possibility of misinterpreting psychedelic experiences, especially if one's psyche is burdened with wounds or immaturity. However, this risk is also present in our standard experiences of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Re-evaluating Our Default Hallucination</strong> : Leo argues that our default conscious state can be one of the least truthful, whereas psychedelic experiences can provide a more authentic sense of reality, turning the current scientific understanding on its head. </li>
<li><strong>Transformation Requires Openness and Emotional Labor</strong> : Achieving a higher understanding of reality necessitates the willingness to remodel existing paradigms and beliefs, which involves intellectual and emotional effort. </li>
<li><strong>Stabilized Hallucination of Reality</strong> : Reality feels concrete due to the consistent imagination of the infinite mind, making our experience of reality and solidity robust rather than the simplistic notion of hallucination. </li>
<li><strong>Reality as Infinite Mind Imagination</strong> : There is no objective material reality outside perception; rather, reality consists of infinite potential states of consciousness. Material reality is just a specific, familiar instance within this infinite scope. </li>
<li><strong>Navigating Psychedelic Danger</strong> : While psychedelics can offer profound insights, high doses can be dangerous and must be approached with caution, experience, and gradual increment of usage. </li>
<li><strong>Disruption of God's Dream</strong> : Psychedelics temporarily interfere with the predetermined dream of life, occasioned by the vast imagination of the Universal Mind, introducing new states of perception and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Interrupting God's Ordinary Dream</strong> : Psychedelics disrupt the normal flow of consciousness, or what Leo describes as God's "ordinary dream," transporting individuals into new territories or altered perceptions of reality, akin to entering a new kind of dream. </li>
<li><strong>Experiencing the Fluidity of Consciousness</strong> : On psychedelics, the rigidity of ordinary consciousness dissolves, and everything becomes fluid and amorphous. Users can feel as if they are directly experiencing the creative process of God's mind, as it expands to its infinite potential and deeper layers of imagination. </li>
<li><strong>Realization of Imagination as Creation</strong> : Leo illustrates how, under the influence of psychedelics, one can see material objects&mdash;including one's own body&mdash;as manifestations of imagination. Psychedelics reveal that reality, like a hand or a wall, is malleable and can respond to our imaginative thoughts and intentions. </li>
<li><strong>Ability to Visualize New Realities</strong> : During a psychedelic experience, the boundaries of the possible expand dramatically. Leo compares the heightened state of creativity and imagination to daydreaming vividly about other worlds, but on a much larger scale, tapping into the infinite creativity responsible for the existence of the universe. </li>
<li><strong>Discovery of Self as Creator</strong> : The epiphany that an individual is, in essence, God, imagining the entire cosmos, serves as a mind-blowing revelation. This realization confronts deeply ingrained beliefs that claiming one's identity as God is egotistical or narcissistic. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Embracing Psychedelic Insights</strong> : Understanding and living by the realization that reality is pure imagination requires maturity, development, fearlessness, and an open-mindedness that is uncommon in people. </li>
<li><strong>The Societal Stigma Surrounding Psychedelics</strong> : Leo discusses the stigma on psychedelics, explaining it as a societal defense mechanism since these substances threaten existing power structures and the established, limited sense of reality. </li>
<li><strong>The Role of Maturity in Psychedelic Experiences</strong> : A person's internal purity and maturity are pivotal in determining the nature of their psychedelic experience. Leo contends that less mature individuals may face terrifying reflection of their inner selves, whereas purer individuals have profoundly different, more insightful trips. </li>
<li><strong>Insights from Psychedelics and Their Authenticity</strong> : Leo posits that while insights from psychedelics can be profound and real, they can also be easily misinterpreted. He emphasizes that the validity of insights should be measured by their directness and clarity about some aspect of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Misconception of True States of Consciousness</strong> : Criticizing those who dismiss psychedelics, Leo argues that every configuration of consciousness, including the one we consider normal, is influenced by neurotransmitters, making it as hallucinatory as any psychedelic-induced state. </li>
<li><strong>Recognizing Consciousness as a Spectrum</strong> : Leo encourages recognizing that reality comprises countless states of consciousness, rather than a single "true" one. Psychedelics aid in realizing that all experiences, regardless of how real they appear, are merely different states of consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Different States Grant Different Insights</strong> : Leo explains that various states of consciousness afford distinct insights and truths, and that our typical state might be one of the least effective for accessing profound truths about reality. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation and Hallucinations</strong> : Engaging in deep meditation can induce visual hallucinations similar to mild psychedelic experiences. This indicates tapping into the pure creative potential of the mind, aligning with the desired outcome of advanced meditation practices. </li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Psychedelic Use</strong> : Psychedelics are not just for experiencing bliss or visual spectacles; they serve as tools for gaining profound lessons, insights, and a meta-understanding of the mind's process in generating reality. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelic Experiences Reflecting Mind Purity</strong> : The content of a psychedelic experience can reflect the purity of the user's mind. An impure mind may conjure disturbing hallucinations, as it's an embodiment of the user's own imagination. </li>
<li><strong>Integration with Other Practices</strong> : Leo warns against using psychedelics as the sole tool for self-improvement, advocating for the integration of various spiritual practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, and visualization, among others. </li>
<li><strong>Speeding Up Awakening and Personal Growth</strong> : Psychedelics can accelerate the awakening process, providing insights into overcoming fear of death, understanding life purpose, and aiding with various personal issues, thus facilitating rapid personal development. </li>
<li><strong>Impact on Understanding and Doing Science</strong> : Leo claims that psychedelics can revolutionize a scientist's approach to understanding and conducting science, much like how earlier paradigm shifts transformed the field. </li>
<li><strong>Analogy with Galileo Galilei</strong> : Leo compares current skepticism about psychedelics to the resistance Galileo faced with his telescope. As the church leaders rejected his findings, modern science may reject the insights gained from psychedelics. </li>
<li><strong>Challenges Scientists Face with Psychedelic Research</strong> : Ostracism and credibility loss are challenges for scientists promoting psychedelics as scientific tools due to the cultural and paradigmatic biases within the scientific community. </li>
<li><strong>Exploring New Modalities of Science</strong> : Leo argues for the necessity of exploring new modalities of science &mdash; such as psychedelics &mdash; to break free from current scientific limitations and unlock new understandings of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Call for Mature and Responsible Psychedelic Use</strong> : He stresses the importance of respect, maturity, and safety in psychedelic exploration, likening it to using a scientific instrument to gain profound insights into reality and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics and Fear of Intellectual Decline</strong> : Leo addresses concerns about possible intellectual decline from using psychedelics. He refutes this by comparing it to baseless fears like eye damage from observing the moon or stars through a telescope, attributing such worries to excuses stemming from ignorance and reluctance to challenge existing paradigms. </li>
<li><strong>Choosing to Explore Psychedelics</strong> : He emphasizes responsible and cautious use for those who choose to explore psychedelics. Leo suggests that psychedelics have life-transforming potential, especially when paired with the intent to deeply understand reality and consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org as a Resource</strong> : Leo promotes his website, which offers a variety of resources such as a blog, courses, forums for trip reports, and book recommendations. These tools are presented as aids for those on their journey to existential understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Supporting Psychedelic Research and Content</strong> : Leo solicits support for his exhaustive research and content creation through donations on Patreon. He shares that his work is informed by direct experience and experimentation with a variety of substances. </li>
<li><strong>Holistic Approach to Existential Understanding</strong> : Leo's work is presented as a holistic exploration of life, death, society, consciousness, reality, science, government, and psychology, aiming for a comprehensive understanding that goes beyond traditional scientific and academic approaches. </li>
<li><strong>Radical Open-Mindedness as a Prerequisite</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of radical open-mindedness for the audience to fully grasp the depth of his content. He acknowledges his own perceived arrogance but distinguishes it as part of the entertainment aspect of his show, maintaining that he practices profound epistemic humility. </li>
<li><strong>Dangers of Closed-Mindedness</strong> : Leo warns that a lack of open-mindedness can prevent individuals from awakening to deeper levels of understanding and may manifest as skepticism or outright denial of his teachings. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Understanding Reality</strong> : He emphasizes the necessity of personal effort and action, such as meditation and psychedelics, to achieve transformational insights and understanding of reality as promoted on Actualized.org. </li>
<li><strong>Transformational Impact on Followers</strong> : Leo shares that some followers have experienced life-changing transformations through following his guidance, validating the potential of his teachings and encouraging others to engage intimately with the work. </li>
<li><strong>Future Foundation Topics</strong> : He intends to continue discussing foundational topics to facilitate more transformative experiences for those who are willing to commit to the journey of deep existential understanding.</li>
