            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mPIVZtxYHJc' target='_blank'>How Survival Shapes Who You Are</a></h1>
            <p><em>"You became how you survived"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Theme - Survival&#39;s Role in Shaping Identity</strong> : Leo Gura emphasizes the profound role survival demands have in shaping a person's identity, particularly during the first 20 years of life. He draws parallels between the evolution of animals and humans, highlighting the significance of the mind's 'shape' in our survival and existence. </li>
<li><strong>Physical Versus Conceptual Survival</strong> : Leo reflects on human survival expanding beyond the physical shape, like that of animals, to conceptual levels involving the mind and psyche, more so with modern technology. </li>
<li><strong>Unconscious Influence of Early Survival</strong> : Our identity today is largely unconscious of how the early survival environments and challenges molded our psyche, including our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Versus Environmental Survival Factors</strong> : While humans may seem externally similar, Leo points out the significant cultural influences on survival strategies that outweigh physical environments, especially in diverse countries like the United States. </li>
<li><strong>Blind Spots from Personal Survival Situations</strong> : Individualistic survival experiences can create huge blind spots in our understanding of others, limiting personal growth and the ability to advance to higher developmental levels. </li>
<li><strong>Early Survival Challenges Impact</strong> : Confronting dysfunctions we carry today requires exploring buried layers of the psyche created during formative years, which originated from how early survival challenges were dealt with. </li>
<li><strong>The Shape of Our Minds Dictates Life Outcomes</strong> : Leo asserts that our psyche, constructed from early survival situations, determines everything in our personal and collective existence, emphasizing the forgotten&mdash;but critical&mdash;influence of early surroundings. </li>
<li><strong>Contrasting Modalities of Survival</strong> : He observes a stark contrast between the survival approaches throughout human history, admonishing a common assumption that humans have always survived similarly. </li>
<li><strong>Permanency of the Formative Years&#39; Impressions</strong> : The first 20 years of life set our psyche in place similarly to drying concrete, impressing traits and behaviors that are increasingly difficult to alter as we age. </li>
<li><strong>Visualizing Alternative Survival Experiences</strong> : Leo proposes a thought experiment urging viewers to imagine radically different upbringing scenarios&mdash;such as growing up in war zones or with a disability&mdash;and consider how drastically that would alter their identity. </li>
<li><strong>Appreciating the Diversity of Human Survival</strong> : By illustrating the wide range of survival scenarios that humans can experience, he aims to show the vast differences in our identities and worldviews that stem from our unique survival strategies. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment and Understanding of Survival Strategies</strong> : He warns against judgment and encourages appreciation for the unique and complex survival strategies adopted by individuals, which can be vastly different due to cultural and environmental influences. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Strategies and Their Transformation of Identity</strong> : Leo stresses that not only physical attributes but also survival strategies at the conceptual level are integral in shaping our very identity and perspectives on life and reality. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment of Other's Survival Strategies</strong> : We're often judgmental towards others' survival approaches because our own strategies are deeply intertwined with our self-identity, making it challenging to see from another's perspective who had to adapt to different, possibly harsher, survival circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Survival and Reality Perception</strong> : To survive in drastically different environments, like being a woman in a conservative versus a liberal society, people have to see reality from a point of view that enables their survival even if it differs greatly from our own. </li>
<li><strong>Childhood Survival and Understanding</strong> : Children, lacking a comprehensive understanding of reality, must develop survival strategies as they grow, often without proper guidance from adults, which can result in varied and flawed methods of coping with life's challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Parents on Survival Strategies</strong> : The quality of survival strategies passed down from parents is critical. Dysfunctional parental guidance or a shift in external circumstances, like growing up in a new war zone, can leave children ill-equipped for survival with profound life-long impacts. </li>
<li><strong>Survival's Impact on Psyche and Morality</strong> : Survival shapes not just physical well-being, but the psyche, including beliefs, worldviews, morality, and values. For instance, understanding Hitler's early survival challenges can give insights into his adult psyche and actions. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Strategy Reflection Exercise</strong> : Leo Gura encourages viewers to reflect on and list early childhood survival challenges, like struggling to stay clean while eating or staying warm, as these influence one's current behaviors and mindset. </li>
<li><strong>Financial Survival Struggles</strong> : Leo shares his own fluctuating financial circumstances in his family, teaching him a conservative approach towards money and life, which later became a dysfunctional habit despite achieving financial abundance. </li>
<li><strong>Sexuality and Survival</strong> : Early experiences and challenges related to sexuality, influenced by factors like parental morality, shape our current views on sexuality, from conservative to liberal. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Social Survival Challenges</strong> : Struggles with socializing, being bullied, academic achievements, and fitting in with peers during school years shape one's psyche significantly. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Family Dynamics on Survival</strong> : Family dynamics involving approval seeking, divorce, identity forging, and societal norms greatly impact one's development and approach to life's challenges. </li>
<li><strong>Identity Shaped by Interests and Hobbies</strong> : Exploring different interests and hobbies in early years plays a critical role in the formation of one's identity and approach to life. </li>
<li><strong>Family's Religious or Secular Environment</strong> : The presence or lack of religion in one's early home environment, secular or scientific inclinations included, significantly shapes a person's beliefs and values. </li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Musings in Youth</strong> : Contemplations on life, death, and the awareness of mortality in one's younger years profoundly influence an individual's psyche and outlook on life. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Debates, Disagreements, and Mentors</strong> : Discussions with parents, elders, friends, and the positive or negative influences of mentors play a role in shaping one's perspectives and decision-making processes. </li>
<li><strong>Cultural Influences Such as Music</strong> : The music listened to during formative years, along with health issues or familial financial status, contributes to the development of a person's character and coping mechanisms. </li>
<li><strong>Early Romantic Encounters and Rejections</strong> : Experiences such as early romances, pregnancies, abortions, or rejections from teams, jobs, and educational institutions all impact identity formation and coping styles. </li>
<li><strong>Coping Mechanisms Define Identity</strong> : The ways in which a person has adapted and coped with the above situations essentially determine their current identity. </li>
<li><strong>'Fill in the Blank' Exercise for Self-Reflection</strong> : A suggested activity involving completing sentences like "Life is...", "Men/Women are...", "Happiness is...", to uncover deep-seated beliefs shaped by survival situations. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Survival on Personal Perceptions and Morality</strong> : Early survival scenarios not only shape tangible aspects of one's life but also abstract concepts like morality, likes, dislikes, and the psyche itself. These form our ego mind, which needs survival as much as our physical bodies. </li>
<li><strong>The Ego Mind's Accumulation of Survival Strategies</strong> : The first 20 years of life involve a crucial accretion of survival-based beliefs, opinions, and traits which become integrated into one's ego mind. </li>
<li><strong>Physical vs. Psychological Survival</strong> : Recognizing that survival influences not just physical well-being but also psychological stability through the development of fears, insecurities, and defense mechanisms. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Early Survival on Individual Preferences and Behaviors</strong> : Early survival experiences shape more than one's worldview; they also impact everyday preferences like the food we eat, our social behaviors, and even our handling of money and choice of attire. </li>
<li><strong>Examining One's Identity</strong> : A deep dive into understanding how much of one's identity is not a deliberate choice but a culmination of various adaptations to survival challenges faced early in life. </li>
<li><strong>Identity Changes and Life Outcomes</strong> : The importance of modifying core identity traits derived from survival strategies to achieve improved life outcomes, even though it feels uncomfortable and counterintuitive. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Strategies and Rationalizations</strong> : Survival strategies are often rationalized to avoid questioning our identity, but recognizing this can lead to an improvement in quality of life. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Conscious Change for Identity Improvement</strong> : An emphasis on the need for intentional change and the understanding that the quality of life improves with an in-depth transformation of one's core identity. </li>
<li><strong>Fragility and Contingency of Life Trajectories</strong> : Our lives follow extremely fragile and arbitrary paths, influenced by minor events that exponentially steer our future. Like the chaos theory's butterfly effect, small shifts in our early experiences can have a profound impact on our adult identities and beliefs. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Approval and Attention</strong> : Approvals we received during childhood, like laughter for being humorous or love for academic achievements, can cement certain personas in us that last a lifetime. These form our psyche&mdash;dictating our careers, social behavior, and even our methods of attaining love and approval. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Conditioned Beauty Standards</strong> : If one receives attention for physical beauty during formative years, they may develop an obsession with maintaining this image, affecting their relationship dynamics, self-esteem, sense of identity, and even their livelihood. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment as an Obstacle in Self-Study</strong> : Self-judgment hinders the ability to objectively observe and understand our survival strategies. Like good science, psychic archaeology requires neutral examination of one's history and experiences to gain honest insight into one's survival mechanisms. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Strategy Examples and Their Lasting Effects</strong> : Personal identity can be shaped by seemingly trivial early experiences&mdash;like a young man developing anti-feminist views due to betrayal by a first girlfriend. Childhood affection deficits from parents can lead to ingrained survival strategies, coping mechanisms, and insecurities that endure for decades. </li>
<li><strong>Correlation Between Unmet Love Needs and Dysfunctions</strong> : A lack of parental love is profoundly correlated with dysfunctional behavior in adulthood. In-depth psychoanalysis can reveal how current issues trace back to the absence of love during one's early years. </li>
<li><strong>Illogical Relations Between Childhood Experiences and Worldview</strong> : One's worldview, including religious beliefs and intellectual interests, may stem from emotional reactions to early family dynamics rather than logic or scientific thinking. Even a successful career in science can be a coping mechanism for unmet emotional needs. </li>
<li><strong>Survival is the Real Driving Force Behind Life Choices</strong> : Many of our behaviors and beliefs are not based on rational thought but are survival strategies developed in response to our need for love. Personal and career choices may be a result of trying to gain approval and love rather than genuine interest or passion. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Socio-economic Context and Family Dynamics on Identity</strong> : Factors like socioeconomic status, race, home environment, and parental relationships shape our coping mechanisms and biases. These influences can lead to a distorted self-perception, with some inadequacies grounded in reality and others being purely illusory. </li>
<li><strong>Transference of Perceived Inadequacies to Identity and Survival</strong> : Perceptions of inadequacy can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies, further fueling biases and personal limitations. Often, these self-perceptions are not logical consequences of life circumstances but emotional responses adopted as survival strategies in childhood. </li>
<li><strong>Unconscious Survival Choices</strong> : Most individuals don't consciously choose their survival strategies; they often select the first available option that allows them to cope, without considering the long-term consequences of these choices. </li>
<li><strong>Dysfunctional Survival Mechanisms</strong> : People might engage in behaviors like chronic substance use as an immediate survival strategy during challenging times like school, without contemplating alternative strategies or future ramifications. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Strategies Distorting Reality Perception</strong> : Reliance on certain biases and compensation mechanisms to survive can severely distort an individual's perception of reality, as they become unable to envision living without these strategies. </li>
<li><strong>Defense Mechanisms and Self-Deception</strong> : In order to maintain a chosen survival mechanism, individuals often deceive themselves by ignoring or hiding the painful or uncomfortable aspects of reality that they prefer to avoid. </li>
<li><strong>Denial as a Coping Tactic</strong> : When deeply connected to a community or belief system, individuals can develop defense mechanisms that prevent them from examining the truth of these beliefs due to the fear of losing their community and sense of belonging. </li>
<li><strong>Rationalization of Biases</strong> : Once a defense mechanism is in place, individuals will rationalize and justify avoiding certain types of information that threaten their survival constructs, leading to further distortion of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Experience and Cultural Shock</strong> : Leo recounts his move from the USSR to America, highlighting the profound impact this had on his worldview and the social survival strategies he had to adopt due to the cultural shock and language barriers. </li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Effects of Early Survival Strategies</strong> : Leo describes how early survival situations, such as trying to socially adapt in a new country, can leave lasting insecurities and biases, even leading to overcompensation and inauthenticity in social interactions. </li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal and Introspection</strong> : The early social survival experiences Leo faced led him to be solitary and introspective, which shaped his lifestyle choices, independence, avoidance of groupthink, and even the direction of his work. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Financial Instability</strong> : Leo details how financial instability in his family led him to develop conservative financial habits. While this initially helped him bootstrap his businesses, he later needed to adjust his overly conservative approach to enjoy his success. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Modification for Survival</strong> : In light of his growth, Leo recognized the importance of moderating his conservative financial habits and began to strike a better balance between frugality and enjoyment. </li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Financial Instability</strong> : Leo experienced financial instability in his childhood, which forced him to focus intensely on academics and career from an early age, sacrificing his social and personal life for financial security. This pragmatic approach led to financial independence which allowed the creation of Actualized.org, but also resulted in dysfunctional habits regarding money management. </li>
<li><strong>Reliance on External Approval</strong> : Through academic achievement, Leo sought love and approval from educators, which benefited him by improving his education but later recognized as an unhealthy dependency. He had to rewire his mindset to shift his motivation from extrinsic to intrinsic, seeking approval from within rather than externals like praise in comments or academic accolades. </li>
<li><strong>Dysfunctional Coping Mechanisms</strong> : Leo acknowledges that coping mechanisms developed to avoid suffering can become rationalized even if they're dysfunctional. They may provide less suffering than if they were not in place but still cause significant issues. He advocates for finding healthier coping mechanisms as an "upgrade" to one's psychological armor. </li>
<li><strong>Seeking Love from Within</strong> : Leo discusses the dangers of seeking love from external sources and the importance of finding self-reliance in love. He points out the need to replace contingent ways of finding love with more stable and self-sourced love, suggesting that true self-love is far deeper and more fulfilling than love from others. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Genetics on Identity</strong> : Leo notes that while survival challenges significantly shape our identities, genetics also play a significant role and are largely unchangeable. He suggests focusing on changeable aspects, like survival challenges, to understand and shape who we are. </li>
<li><strong>Deep Suffering and Love Influence Identity</strong> : The deepest sources of suffering and love in the first 20 years of life are emphasized as the most significant influences on our identity. They shape our coping mechanisms, insecurities, fears, and how we seek love and approval in later life. </li>
<li><strong>Improving Love Sources</strong> : Leo warns against seeking love from dysfunctional sources, advocating for the development of self-sourced love. He encourages replacing partial, contingent forms of love with more holistic and expansive methods, which are less dependent on external validation. </li>
<li><strong>Confusion of Survival Strategies with Identity</strong> : Leo explains that individuals often confuse their survival patterns and strategies with their actual identity, attaching themselves to these strategies because they've formed an identity out of them. It's a problem because survival is ultimately a losing game, which sets up a person for failure. </li>
<li><strong>Contingent and Arbitrary Worldview</strong> : The exercise presented is to illustrate how one's worldview is contingent, arbitrary, and could have been different under altered survival situations. Recognizing this can help detach from one's worldview and not treat it as the ultimate truth. </li>
<li><strong>Survival as an Illusion and Fantasy</strong> : Leo calls most worldviews illusions and fantasies, cobbled together for mere survival rather than representing absolute truth. He asserts that even science is not an objective pinnacle of truth but a survival strategy. </li>
<li><strong>Rationalizations of Worldview</strong> : There is a tendency to rationalize one's worldview as the best and only truth without acknowledging it's based on a narrow survival strategy. Leo suggests that this results in engaging in debates and defenses instead of seeking deeper truths. </li>
<li><strong>Scientific Truth as a Survival Strategy</strong> : Leo challenges the belief in science as the epitome of objective truth, labeling it another survival strategy that's denied as such, thereby showing the limitations of our survival-based understandings. </li>
<li><strong>Grift in Belief Systems and Survival</strong> : The lecture outlines how powerful individuals in media, business, science, and politics often rationalize their survival strategies as good and true, to the extent of self-deception, even if they are grifting. </li>
<li><strong>True vs. Rationalized Goodness</strong> : The distinction is made between what is truly good (the whole of existence) and what the ego rationalizes as good &mdash; the latter often being a narrow and biased slice of the whole pie of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Biased Worldviews</strong> : Leo emphasizes that everyone carves out different versions of what is good based on their survival strategies, leading to conflicting worldviews and misunderstandings among people. </li>
<li><strong>Questions for Self-Reflection on Survival and Identity</strong> : A series of questions encourage self-reflection on how one's top fears, insecurities, values, and strategies for love were shaped by early survival challenges, as well as recognizing outdated survival patterns that are limiting present potential. </li>
<li><strong>Compassion for Early Survival Situations</strong> : Leo urges viewers to have compassion for their early survival situations and those of others, acknowledging that people's circumstances are often beyond their control and based on ignorance. </li>
<li><strong>Cycle of Ignorance and Wisdom</strong> : He highlights the role of ignorance in perpetuating dysfunctional behaviors and survival strategies, and the importance of wisdom, education, and higher teachings in breaking this cycle. </li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Roots of Different Worldviews</strong> : Leo suggests that understanding the different, often difficult, survival environments of others can lead to greater empathy and recognition of why they may have developed views and behaviors we view as challenging. </li>
<li><strong>Cycle of Ignorance</strong> : Leo describes the perpetuation of ignorance across generations, where abusive or misleading behaviors by adults, mentors, and teachers are passed on, as they themselves were likely victim to similar treatment. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Knowing Better</strong> : Emphasizes the value in just knowing what is right and the possible actions and their consequences, which can take decades to comprehend and is an essential but often undervalued aspect of self-improvement. </li>
<li><strong>Defense Mechanisms as Epistemological Barriers</strong> : Defensive survival strategies can severely restrict someone's capacity to learn or accept new information, indicating a locked and closed mindset resistant to change. </li>
<li><strong>Survival Script Robotic Nature</strong> : Leo concludes that most of a person's identity is acting out learned survival scripts robotically, and spirituality and self-development entail transcending and refining these survival strategies. </li>
<li><strong>Duality of Spiritual Work and Development Work</strong> : There's a distinction between the spiritual work of transcending survival and the development work of creating healthier survival strategies, both of which are important for growth. </li>
<li><strong>Generational Survival Mechanisms</strong> : Each generation, including Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Zoomers, develops its own unique survival mechanisms, blind spots, and limitations, which substantially shape the society's consciousness and love. </li>
<li><strong>Reactive vs. Conscious Survival</strong> : Most people survive reactively and opportunistically, leading to evil and deception. Leo advocates for conscious survival that is deliberate and proactive, aligning with a higher purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Long-term Investment in Conscious Survival</strong> : Encourages viewing the process of conscious survival as a wise long-term investment that eventually yields dividends, reinforcing it as an essential aspect of one's life. </li>
<li><strong>Urge to Understand Survival in Depth</strong> : Leo underscores the imperative of deeply understanding survival to build a solid foundation for personal development and eventual spiritual exploration. </li>
<li><strong>Resources on Actualized.org</strong> : Leo suggests using resources from his website like book reviews, a life purpose course, a forum, and invites support through Patreon, also announcing a new YouTube channel for condensed clips of his videos. </li>
<li><strong>Priority of Mastering Survival for Youth</strong> : Advises younger individuals to master basic survival skills before exploring advanced spiritual and philosophical topics, to prepare for a profound exploration of life beyond survival. </li>
<li><strong>Caution Against Excessive Focus on Survival</strong> : Warns of the risk associated with losing oneself in the endless chase of survival, recommending learning enough to survive but avoiding over-indulgence that may be counterproductive.</li>
