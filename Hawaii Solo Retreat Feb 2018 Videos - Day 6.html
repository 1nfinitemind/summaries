            <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/hawaii-solo-retreat-feb-2018-videos' target='_blank'>Hawaii Solo Retreat Feb 2018 Videos - Day 6</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Day six struggles</strong> : Leo describes his worst day of the retreat, succumbing to addictions by surfing the internet for hours, resulting in a deterioration of his meditation practice and a resurgence of ordinary life thoughts, deviating from his enlightenment journey.</li>
<li><strong>Failing the process</strong> : Leo expresses that failing at meditation is a deeply humbling experience which highlights the difficulties of facing one's inner demons, attachments, and the void of existence. He sees failure as a natural part of the growth process that can nurture compassion for human suffering and the collective challenges we face.</li>
<li><strong>Inner demons and personal obstacles</strong> : Leo confronts his own attachments, including his addictions to the internet, business, and conceptual thinking. He posits that facing and acknowledging these attachments is an important step in the journey towards enlightenment.</li>
<li><strong>Glimpse into the human psyche</strong> : Through grappling with his own struggles, Leo gains an intimate understanding of the powerful nature of the human psyche. He believes personal failures can provide insight into societal issues like addiction and violence, reinforcing the importance of facing and working through one's personal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Compassion through personal suffering</strong> : Leo's experience leads him to develop deeper compassion, as he relates personal suffering to broader societal problems. He suggests that to alleviate the collective suffering, one must first address individual pain and the difficulty of self-improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Surrender as a core aspect of enlightenment</strong> : Discussing the process of enlightenment, Leo emphasizes the necessity of surrendering one's entire existence and attachments, recognizing the void's pure emptiness, and releasing one's perceived identity to truly gain existential insights.</li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment's radical implications</strong> : The path to enlightenment is misconstrued by many; it requires not only order in one's life but the willingness to surrender every aspect of existence, a radical concept often missing from superficial understanding. Enlightenment is more than a state-it's a surrendering process that dissolves even the most deeply-held personal elements.</li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions about enlightenment</strong> : Many who pursue enlightenment have not truly grasped its radical implications, such as the non-existence of a physical body and the deconstruction of long-held scientific and philosophical beliefs. Enlightenment is vastly more profound than just achieving a mystical state, requiring the surrender of all attachments and the recognition of life as an illusion or a dream.</li>
<li><strong>Enlightenment vs. cultural paradigms</strong> : Enlightenment challenges the foundations of Western intellectual tradition and materialistic perspectives, proposing that there is no ultimate control over life, no time, no space, and that reality as we know it is a grand illusion.</li>
<li><strong>Depth of understanding in spiritual pursuit</strong> : The journey of enlightenment necessitates deep, direct experience, and merely conceptual understanding-or listening to spiritual teachings-is not sufficient. The realization that life is akin to a dream only truly sinks in after years of dedicated practice and cannot be apprehended by intellectual reasoning alone.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of being a visionary</strong> : Visionaries are those who have the intuitive capacity to see beyond conventional wisdom, connecting disjointed ideas into a cohesive understanding of deeper truths. While this ability is insightful, it may also isolate the visionary due to skepticism and misunderstanding from others who rely solely on linear, logical thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced insights and validation</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of not hastily dismissing insights that stem from extensive research, intuition, and direct experience. The process of discerning truth is intricate, continuous, and requires a balanced approach between trusting teachings and validating them through personal exploration and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Imperfection in spiritual teachers</strong> : Admonishing viewers to have realistic expectations of spiritual teachers, Leo asserts that seeking perfection in teachers is a misstep, and expecting them to be free from human faults could lead to disillusionment and susceptibility to misleading doctrines or cult-like followings.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of learning from a less mastered teacher</strong> : There is merit in learning from teachers who are openly navigating their spiritual journey, as their experiences can be more relatable and their struggles more illustrative for students who are at earlier stages in their own paths.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing skepticism and open-mindedness</strong> : The path to enlightenment demands a delicate balance of skepticism and open-mindedness-a receptiveness to new ideas without surrendering critical thinking or clinging to outdated beliefs. Rejecting the idea that teachers must be infallible, Leo encourages a nuanced relationship with spiritual guidance that is both grounded and aspirational.</li>
<li><strong>Realities of the spiritual path</strong> : Authentic growth comes with facing personal trials and weaknesses. Leo is committed to continuing meditation, observing his psychological patterns, and detecting how the mind habitually creates problems regardless of external changes.</li>
<li><strong>Inherent problem creation of the mind</strong> : The mind has a tendency to manifest a consistent number of problems no matter the situation, highlighting the importance of addressing internal issues rather than merely changing physical circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration and adaptation of techniques</strong> : Leo is evaluating his practice methods and planning to experiment with new techniques such as yoga, acknowledging that certain methods like self-inquiry may have lost their effectiveness for him.</li>
<li><strong>Use of psychedelics in spiritual growth</strong> : While Leo has experimented with various psychedelics and is considering a return to five Meo DMT for potential permanent enlightenment, he also recognizes the risks and intensive nature of these substances.</li>
<li><strong>Research aspect of Leo's spiritual journey</strong> : Leo's journey includes a research dimension, where he tests different methods and substances, contributing to a broader understanding of spiritual work and aiding others.</li>
<li><strong>Upcoming retreat and integration</strong> : Despite setbacks, Leo finds value in his experiences and intends to learn from them for future retreats, emphasizing the necessity of compassion that arises from personal suffering on the path to enlightenment.</li>
