    <li><b>Retreat introduction and setting</b>: Leo begins his solo meditation retreat, situated in Mountain View, Hawaii, in a cozy cabin amidst a 20–acre jungle property. Despite the drizzling rain, he is enthusiastic to share his setup and environment.
</li><li><b>Preparation and accommodation</b>: The retreat was planned for eight days, but the first day was spent preparing and acclimating to the island. The cabin is off–grid, powered by solar panels and supplied with water from a rain catchment system.
</li><li><b>Sustainability and nourishment</b>: Leo's kitchen is stocked with ample provisions for the retreat, including a variety of fruits, vegetables, eggs, and grains that amount to an eight–day supply. A total of seven gallons of water has been reserved for the duration.
</li><li><b>Meditation plans and adjustments</b>: Leo plans for intensive meditation on the cabin's balcony, utilizing makeshift seating, but is also prepared to move indoors due to the cold temperatures. He has outlined a varied meditative schedule of techniques and practices.
</li><li><b>Daily routine and mental discipline</b>: Beyond formal meditation sessions, Leo applies mindfulness to daily tasks, with planned meals to reduce decision–making. Physical isolation contributes to a focused, uninterrupted retreat experience.
</li><li><b>Solo retreat benefits</b>: Leo advocates for the benefits of solo meditation retreats, highlighting the freedom of location choice, cost–effectiveness, and the deeper work on consciousness achievable in solitude.
</li><li><b>Personal commitment to meditation</b>: The investment of time and money into these retreats underscores Leo's dedication to his consciousness work. Acknowledging the challenges, he remains committed to maintaining a disciplined meditation practice.
</li><li><b>Retreat frequency recommendation</b>: Four solo retreats a year is Leo's recommended frequency for continuous personal growth. He advises scheduling in advance due to the popularity of destinations like Hawaii.
</li><li><b>Content creation to share insights</b>: Leo intends to document daily insights via video recordings, aiming to share takeaways post–retreat. These personal observations may serve as guidance for others on their meditation journeys.
