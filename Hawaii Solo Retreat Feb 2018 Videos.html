            <ul>
<li><strong>Retreat introduction and setting</strong> : Leo begins his solo meditation retreat, situated in Mountain View, Hawaii, in a cozy cabin amidst a 20-acre jungle property. Despite the drizzling rain, he is enthusiastic to share his setup and environment.</li>
<li><strong>Preparation and accommodation</strong> : The retreat was planned for eight days, but the first day was spent preparing and acclimating to the island. The cabin is off-grid, powered by solar panels and supplied with water from a rain catchment system.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability and nourishment</strong> : Leo's kitchen is stocked with ample provisions for the retreat, including a variety of fruits, vegetables, eggs, and grains that amount to an eight-day supply. A total of seven gallons of water has been reserved for the duration.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation plans and adjustments</strong> : Leo plans for intensive meditation on the cabin's balcony, utilizing makeshift seating, but is also prepared to move indoors due to the cold temperatures. He has outlined a varied meditative schedule of techniques and practices.</li>
<li><strong>Daily routine and mental discipline</strong> : Beyond formal meditation sessions, Leo applies mindfulness to daily tasks, with planned meals to reduce decision-making. Physical isolation contributes to a focused, uninterrupted retreat experience.</li>
<li><strong>Solo retreat benefits</strong> : Leo advocates for the benefits of solo meditation retreats, highlighting the freedom of location choice, cost-effectiveness, and the deeper work on consciousness achievable in solitude.</li>
<li><strong>Personal commitment to meditation</strong> : The investment of time and money into these retreats underscores Leo's dedication to his consciousness work. Acknowledging the challenges, he remains committed to maintaining a disciplined meditation practice.</li>
<li><strong>Retreat frequency recommendation</strong> : Four solo retreats a year is Leo's recommended frequency for continuous personal growth. He advises scheduling in advance due to the popularity of destinations like Hawaii.</li>
<li><strong>Content creation to share insights</strong> : Leo intends to document daily insights via video recordings, aiming to share takeaways post-retreat. These personal observations may serve as guidance for others on their meditation journeys.</li>
