            <ul>
<li><strong>Self-Discovery</strong> : Leo emphasizes that understanding who you are is foundational for achieving long-term success, happiness, and fulfillment. This involves identifying your core values, desired feelings, wants, and don't-wants with clarity and conscious articulation. </li>
<li><strong>Life Purpose</strong> : A life purpose is crucial, acting as the convergence point of one's daily actions. Success is often tied to making a significant, positive impact on the world or society, and one must be clear and committed to the desired impact, whether in family, business, or innovation. </li>
<li><strong>Setting Giant Goals</strong> : Rather than setting 'realistic' goals, Leo advises setting ambitious, gargantuan goals. Ambitious goals ignite motivation and passion, while 'realistic' goals can underestimate potential and may actually be harder to achieve due to a lack of inspiration. </li>
<li><strong>Hard Work Aligned with Values</strong> : Success requires hard work, and the secret to enduring this is to align hard work with one's purpose and values. This makes the hard work more enjoyable, blurring the lines between work and leisure time, leading to greater productivity and fulfillment. </li>
<li><strong>Persistence in Adversity</strong> : Leo underscores the importance of not quitting, especially during tough times. Successful people are characterized by their persistence. Learning from failures and pushing through difficulties are essential for growth and ultimately achieving success. </li>
<li><strong>Emotional and Mental Mastery</strong> : Mastering thoughts and emotions is pivotal for success. Techniques like journaling, meditation, mentorship, and coaching can help maintain focus and handle stress, allowing for better execution of tasks and a happier life. </li>
<li><strong>Studying Success</strong> : Leo stresses the importance of deliberately studying the principles of success by attending seminars, reading books, and engaging with successful people. This understanding goes beyond external achievements and delves into the psychology of success. </li>
<li><strong>Resourceful Learning</strong> : Leo mentions Actualized.org as a resource for advanced personal development, emphasizing the significance of understanding the psychology of success and mastering thoughts and emotions. He also mentions his free personal development blueprint that consolidates valuable success principles.</li>
