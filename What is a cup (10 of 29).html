            <ul>
<li><strong>Fantastical perception of understanding</strong> : The average person struggles with the idea of directly knowing the essence of an object, deeming it too fantastical or philosophical to consider seriously. </li>
<li><strong>Myth of leaving the body</strong> : Some envision that to understand an object's essence, one might need to leave their body or engage in science fiction-like acts rather than simply grasping the object in a new way. </li>
<li><strong>New experiences with the familiar</strong> : It's feasible to have a novel experience of a commonplace object, like a cup, which challenges the skepticism around the possibility of grasping its essence. </li>
<li><strong>Self-imposed barrier to knowledge</strong> : Believing that one already understands what a cup is, for example, eliminates the space for inquiry and blocks the potential for direct understanding of its true nature. </li>
<li><strong>Requirement for direct understanding</strong> : Recognizing that our current knowledge is insufficient allows one to explore and directly understand what an object truly is, without indirect influences. </li>
<li><strong>Direct experience clarified</strong> : Experiencing an object is not synonymous with direct understanding; experience can often be indirect, filtered through preconceptions or prior knowledge.</li>
