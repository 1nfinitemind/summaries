            <ul>
    <li><b>Fantastical perception of understanding</b>: The average person struggles with the idea of directly knowing the essence of an object, deeming it too fantastical or philosophical to consider seriously.
</li><li><b>Myth of leaving the body</b>: Some envision that to understand an object's essence, one might need to leave their body or engage in science fiction–like acts rather than simply grasping the object in a new way.
</li><li><b>New experiences with the familiar</b>: It's feasible to have a novel experience of a commonplace object, like a cup, which challenges the skepticism around the possibility of grasping its essence.
</li><li><b>Self–imposed barrier to knowledge</b>: Believing that one already understands what a cup is, for example, eliminates the space for inquiry and blocks the potential for direct understanding of its true nature.
</li><li><b>Requirement for direct understanding</b>: Recognizing that our current knowledge is insufficient allows one to explore and directly understand what an object truly is, without indirect influences.
</li><li><b>Direct experience clarified</b>: Experiencing an object is not synonymous with direct understanding; experience can often be indirect, filtered through preconceptions or prior knowledge.
</li>
