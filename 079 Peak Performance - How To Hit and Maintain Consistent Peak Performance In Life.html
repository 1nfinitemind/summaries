    <li><b>Leo's fascination with peak performance</b>: Leo expresses his enthusiasm for peak performance, which he finds to be one of the greatest feelings–be it in sports, at work, or any other endeavor.
</li><li><b>Compelling vision's role</b>: A compelling vision is presented as a cornerstone for achieving and sustaining peak performance. Without an emotionally engaging vision, maintaining the required level of discipline and energy is challenging.
</li><li><b>Olympic athlete analogy</b>: He draws parallels to Olympic athletes who train rigorously for years, driven by a vivid dream, highlighting the emotional attachment to their goals which fuels their discipline and performance.
</li><li><b>Peak performance requires desire and work</b>: It's emphasized that peak performance isn't accidentally achieved; it involves deliberate efforts, understanding one's motives, and a desire to excel.
</li><li><b>Concept of momentum</b>: Leo introduces momentum as a key concept divided into micro and macro momentum, suggesting that peak performance is built up over time, rather than instantly achieved.
</li><li><b>Building micro–momentum</b>: Small, incremental steps within a day, such as starting with easy tasks and gradually increasing intensity, help in building 'micro–momentum' toward peak performance.
</li><li><b>Building macro–momentum</b>: 'Macro–momentum' refers to the long–term build–up of motivation and habits, which is necessary for achieving sustainable peak performance.
</li><li><b>Discipline and self–improvement</b>: Discipline is vital, and he urges viewers to enhance their self–discipline and become students of personal development to understand the psychological underpinnings of peak performance.
</li><li><b>Physical energy and vitality</b>: Leo underlines that maintaining one's physical health through nutrition and exercise is essential for any kind of peak performance, whether mental or physical.
</li><li><b>Closing encouragement</b>: In his closing remarks, Leo encourages continuous learning in personal development and invites viewers to explore more resources on Actualized.org.
