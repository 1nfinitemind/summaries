            <ul>
    <li><b>Mindfulness Defined</b>: Mindfulness is being present in the moment and observing oneself without judgment or criticism. It's like adding an extra cognitive layer of observation to everyday actions, similar to an objective scientist recording behavior without interjecting personal opinions.
</li><li><b>Self–Conscious Human Capacity</b>: Humans have the unique ability to introspect and be self–aware. Mindfulness leverages this capability to observe daily actions. Leo emphasizes that most people are not as conscious as they think and are merely reacting to stimuli like animals, unaware of their own actions.
</li><li><b>Exercising Mindfulness in Daily Routine</b>: Leo challenges viewers to consciously acknowledge mundane activities, like sitting down to eat or entering and exiting their home. This heightened awareness is difficult because it's easy to forget and revert to unconscious behavior.
</li><li><b>Difficulty of Maintaining Mindfulness</b>: Leo presents an exercise to maintain a single thought about oneself for 60 seconds without getting distracted. This exercise highlights the difficulties in sustaining focused self–awareness, as extraneous thoughts inevitably intrude.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Negative Emotions</b>: Leo advises bringing mindfulness to negative emotions by observing them when they arise instead of reacting. Watching one's emotional responses to events, like being cut off in traffic, provides an exercise in maintaining detachment and self–control.
</li><li><b>Detachment Benefits and Enhanced Performance</b>: By observing negative experiences from a third–party perspective, one can avoid suffering and react more consciously, leading to improved performance in business, relationships, and life in general.
</li><li><b>Meditation as Mindfulness Practice</b>: Leo recommends daily meditation, particularly 20–minute sessions, to further develop mindfulness. He mentions that more techniques and tips for meditation can be found in his other videos.
</li><li><b>Viewer Engagement</b>: Leo invites viewers to provide comments, which he uses for feedback and ideas for future content. He promotes his newsletter, offering exclusive videos, a 19–part video series on busting limiting beliefs, and a monthly chance to win two hours of free coaching.
