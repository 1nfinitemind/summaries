            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Passion for Squirting</b>: Leo expresses his enthusiasm for making a girl squirt, considering it a highly pleasurable and favored aspect of sexual experiences.
</li><li><b>Definition of Squirting</b>: Squirt is described as an explosive orgasm where a woman ejaculates fluids, with the extent varying across individuals and influenced by mood and technique.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Mindset over Technique</b>: Leo reiterates the importance of emotions and creating feelings of safety, relaxation, and openness in the partner over the specific fingering technique used.
</li><li><b>Necessary Intimacy Levels</b>: He advises against using the squirting technique with someone new or without established sexual intimacy, recommending it for later in a relationship or within a marriage to renew excitement.
</li><li><b>Potential for All Women to Squirt</b>: Leo suggests that while some women may squirt naturally due to their comfort and openness, others could also squirt if made to feel at ease and if psychological barriers are dismantled.
</li><li><b>Optimal Environment</b>: For the process, a quiet, unrushed setting is crucial, with Leo recommending home privacy and uninterrupted time for a couple.
</li><li><b>Relaxation Through Massage</b>: A thorough, non–sexual massage is suggested as a method to relax the partner and build anticipation without directly touching intimate areas initially.
</li><li><b>Intimacy Development</b>: He stresses looking into the partner's eyes, verbal affection, and establishing a special emotional connection prior to sexual activity.
</li><li><b>Expressing Enthusiasm for Squirting</b>: Leo encourages communicating excitement about squirting to the partner to make them more receptive and overcome any reservations they may have about the act.
</li><li><b>Guiding Her to Squirt</b>: He suggests assuming a guiding role, assuring that the act of squirting is adventurous rather than demanding performance and creating a dominant–submissive dynamic where she follows his lead to feel more comfortable.
</li><li><b>Dispelling Peeing Concerns</b>: Leo stresses the need to explicitly explain that squirting is different from peeing and to encourage the partner to push out fluids during orgasm without fear of judgment.
</li><li><b>Preparation for Squirting</b>: Leo explains that communication before the act is essential. He advises to tell the woman to be ready to push and squirt during her orgasm, asserting that this instruction is key to the process and might not occur without such guidance.
</li><li><b>Positioning and Comfort</b>: Leo describes setting up by lying the woman on her back with legs spread, a pillow under her head for support, and positioning himself closely beside her for better leverage and to enhance intimacy.
</li><li><b>Fingering Technique for G–spot</b>: The technique involves using the middle and ring finger together, inserted deeply into the vagina, to stimulate the G–spot. He recommends using the part of the finger close to the base rather than the tips for effective stimulation and encourages starting the motion slowly with press and release actions.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Discomfort</b>: Leo stresses the importance of ensuring the woman is extremely wet to prevent discomfort from friction during the aggressive hand movements required for the technique.
</li><li><b>Increasing Intensity Leading to Orgasm</b>: He guides on progressively increasing the speed and intensity of the stimulation, ultimately leading to fast and hard pumping motions using the whole arm, not just the hand, as the woman approaches orgasm.
</li><li><b>Vocal Encouragement During Climax</b>: As the woman nears climax, Leo underlines the need for looking into her eyes, establishing a deep connection, and vocally guiding her to squirt and push, indicating the importance of timing these instructions in the last moments before orgasm.
</li><li><b>Post–Orgasm Stimulation</b>: He advocates for continuing the motion through the orgasm to extend its duration, potentially leading to additional orgasms, and mentions that at this point, the intensity can be slightly reduced if necessary.
</li><li><b>Physical Demands of the Technique</b>: Leo acknowledges that the technique is physically demanding, suggesting exercises to build up arm and finger strength.
</li><li><b>Intimacy Building Through Sexual Achievement</b>: He explains that helping a woman squirt can greatly deepen intimacy and make her more attracted to her partner, as it presents an exciting and novel sexual experience that breaks free from societal conditioning.
</li><li><b>Enhancing Overall Life Beyond the Bedroom</b>: Leo encourages the pursuit of self–mastery across all areas of life, including relationships and self–understanding, to improve not just sexual experiences but all facets of one's life.
</li><li><b>Promoting Actualized.org Resources</b>: He invites the audience to subscribe to the Actualized.org newsletter for more tips and information on personal development, which will aid in improving relationships and overall success.
