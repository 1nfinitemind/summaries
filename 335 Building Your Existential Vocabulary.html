        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/DV7a-N3-nkw' target='_blank'>Building Your Existential Vocabulary</a></h1>
        <p><em>"The limits of my vocabulary means the limits of my world." - Ludwig<br />
Wittgenstein</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realization of Language's Importance</strong> : Leo considers language central to self-actualization and existential inquiry, advocating for a conscious examination of the fundamental building blocks of concepts represented by basic words. </li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Words Technique</strong> : Leo introduces a simple technique that enhances understanding by contemplating the definitions of basic, fundamental words like reality, existence, and consciousness, which are sourced from multiple dictionaries and logged digitally for ongoing reference. </li>
<li><strong>Assumed Understanding of Basics</strong> : Leo observes that people often overlook the definitions of fundamental words, assuming they understand them, while focusing on learning complex vocabulary without recognizing the profound importance of simpler, foundational terms. </li>
<li><strong>Metaphysics and Default Worldviews</strong> : He points out the irony that even those who dismiss metaphysics and philosophy are shaped by the default metaphysics of their culture, leading to an unquestioned and potentially flawed perception of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Educational System's Flaw</strong> : Leo criticizes educational institutions for not teaching students to define and understand basic concepts such as reality, energy, or existence, which form the very basis of enlightened thought and understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Illusion of Completeness in Science</strong> : Leo argues that science maneuvers around the essence of variables such as time and space without truly understanding them. This oversight creates the false impression that science has a comprehensive grasp of reality, when in reality, it often deals with loosely defined concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Articulation for Clarity and Teaching</strong> : He emphasizes the importance of articulation, not only for communication and persuasive teaching but also for personal clarity. Articulating fundamental concepts helps to dispel misconceptions and deepen understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Overreliance on Language and Mind</strong> : Leo warns about the deceitful nature of language and the mind, highlighting that careful study of language's limitations is essential to prevent being misled by its inherent complexity. </li>
<li><strong>Struggle of Defining Concepts</strong> : When attempting to define abstract concepts like time or existence, one may realize that language can be a deceptive game, using synonyms to create an illusion of understanding without truly explaining what those concepts are. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit vs Explicit Knowledge</strong> : Most people understand things implicitly, taking words like time and energy for granted because they learned them young without further contemplation. Explicit understanding, on the other hand, involves actively defining and articulating these concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Language Development</strong> : Leo's personal experience as a non-native English speaker reflects his appreciation for explicit knowledge. He enforced a rule to look up every unknown word immediately, helping him to eventually surpass the vocabulary understanding of native speakers. </li>
<li><strong>Effort in Vocabulary Enhancement</strong> : The advancement of vocabulary often requires deliberate effort and practice. Leo's systematic approach of consistently learning and looking up definitions contributed to his mastery of the English language. </li>
<li><strong>Critique of Academic Writing</strong> : Leo criticizes academic books that use complicated language, asserting that clarity is lost in the process. He strives for simplicity in communication, preferring to communicate ideas in a straightforward manner. </li>
<li><strong>Simplicity in Communication</strong> : The clearest communicators, according to Leo, are those who can express deep ideas simply and directly. He encourages the avoidance of unnecessarily complex language, suggesting that true understanding should be communicable even to a child. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit vs Explicit Grasp of Concepts</strong> : Recognizing the difference between vague understanding and a solid grasp is crucial. Truly understanding the building blocks of reality requires acknowledgment that mainstream society's perceived comprehension is incomplete and potentially flawed. </li>
<li><strong>List of Fundamental Words and Concepts</strong> : Leo offers a list of words (e.g., reality, emotion, truth, science, consciousness, enlightenment) to explore, urging people to look up their definitions promptly when encountered to deepen their understanding. </li>
<li><strong>Criticism of Rationalists and Atheists</strong> : He criticizes those who dismiss concepts like 'God' and 'spirituality' without fully understanding them, pointing out their ignorance and failure to recognize the limitations of science. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Definitions, Synonyms, and Etymology</strong> : Understanding the historical derivation of words (etymology) and their interconnectedness through synonyms provides deeper insight. Leo emphasizes the value of appreciating the complexity of language for better grasping reality. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Word Journaling</strong> : Maintaining a journal to document word exploration can enhance understanding of life's fundamental aspects. Leo suggests that this practice can lead to profound knowledge over time, improving communication, teaching, and contemplation. </li>
<li><strong>Exploring Word Etymology</strong> : Leo advises delving into the historical origins of words to uncover deeper meanings and hidden insights, which can enrich one's understanding of vocabulary. </li>
<li><strong>Journaling Vocabulary</strong> : He stresses the importance of recording new words and their meanings in a journal, rather than just looking them up and forgetting them, to reinforce learning and aid retention. </li>
<li><strong>Examining Synonyms and Antonyms</strong> : Leo recommends looking at synonyms and antonyms to appreciate the subtle nuances and connotations that different words carry. </li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Vocabulary Expansion</strong> : He urges making a lifelong habit of researching fundamental words that are the building blocks of reality, such as sex, love, happiness, and money, to deepen one's understanding of these concepts. </li>
<li><strong>Low-Investment, High-Impact Activity</strong> : Leo emphasizes that researching vocabulary is a low-effort activity with potentially significant long-term benefits for one's cognition and worldview. </li>
<li><strong>Utilizing Modern Technology</strong> : He notes the ease of using smartphones and the internet to immediately look up unfamiliar words, a task that was more challenging in the pre-digital age. </li>
<li><strong>Importance for Non-native English Speakers</strong> : For those learning English as a second language, Leo suggests consistently looking up new or unclear words as a powerful method to master the language. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Sloppy Thinking During Enlightenment</strong> : Leo warns against equating enlightenment with poor thinking, stating that clear thinking and enlightenment can coexist and support each other. </li>
<li><strong>Opening Up to Non-Symbolic Experiences</strong> : While recognizing the value of clear communication and thinking, Leo proposes that understanding the limits of language can lead to powerful non-symbolic experiences of reality. </li>
<li><strong>Actualized.org Content Creation Challenges</strong> : Leo shares his personal challenge of producing new, high-quality content without repetition and his aim to present profound concepts in a clear, comprehensive manner.</li>
