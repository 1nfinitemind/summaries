        <ul>
<li><strong>Nonduality Explained</strong> : Nonduality signifies that reality is illusory, without boundaries, and all distinctions merge into a singular unity where concepts of self, other, world, and purpose dissolve into an Infinite Void akin to God, who is equated with Nothingness.</li>
<li><strong>Hitler's Resistance</strong> : Hitler challenges the nondualistic idea with the assertion that science deems it a New Age brain construct, up until his recognition that both science and the brain are concepts within the very illusion he is questioning.</li>
<li><strong>Crisis of Understanding</strong> : As Hitler processes the nonduality teaching, he angrily questions the non-existence of the physical world, challenging 2000 years of Western thought, and grappling with the conflict between reality's perceived solidity and its alleged illusory nature.</li>
<li><strong>Existential Dilemma</strong> : Hitler expresses an existential crisis, finding it mind-warping to comprehend that all personal and collective struggles might be pointless if everything, including antagonism and identity, is just a dreamlike illusion with no true substance.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual and Emotional Upheaval</strong> : Hitler decries his entire worldview as a futile mental exercise, lamenting the time invested in defending beliefs that now appear baseless, and yearns instead for simpler, undeniable pleasures like enjoying nature and attending spiritual gatherings.</li>
