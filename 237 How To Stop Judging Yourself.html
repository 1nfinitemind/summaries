            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ulam38XpQG4' target='_blank'>How To Stop Judging Yourself</a></h1>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Judgments Poisoning Life</strong> : Leo discusses how judgments negatively affect our lives and emphasizes that we are often not conscious of how they backfire on us. He suggests that when we judge others, we simultaneously judge ourselves, creating future hardships. </li>
<li><strong>Judgment of Physical Appearance</strong> : An example Leo provides is judging obese people negatively. For those who are health-conscious, this judgment can lead to self-loathing if they gain weight and an unhealthy, obsessive attitude towards fitness. </li>
<li><strong>Relationship Strain from Judgments</strong> : Judgment can strain relationships; if a partner gains weight, the person who has judged obese people might find it bothersome, potentially causing arguments or even a breakup. </li>
<li><strong>Judging Attractiveness Creates Self Repression</strong> : Leo talks about how women often judge other women who are considered very attractive, labeling them derogatorily, which later manifests as guilt or repression in their own intimate relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Judging the Wealthy and Self-Sabotage</strong> : He explains that judging rich people as immoral can lead to personal self-sabotage, where one's own success feels undeserved or is actively undermined due to the internal belief that becoming wealthy is bad. </li>
<li><strong>Subconscious Nature of Judgments</strong> : Judgments from the past can affect us subconsciously years later, and Leo stresses the importance of connecting the dots to recognize these long-term effects. </li>
<li><strong>Judging Novices and Fear of Being Judged</strong> : Leo exemplifies how judging beginners at the gym can later make us fear being judged when we ourselves are novices in a new activity, potentially causing us to quit or avoid trying new things. </li>
<li><strong>Illustrations of Common Judgments</strong> : Through various examples, Leo demonstrates how judgments about looks, health, wealth, and skill levels can backfire, affecting personal health routines, relationships, business success, and willingness to try new experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Consciousness and Quitting</strong> : When individuals feel like novices, such as being new to golf, they may become self-conscious and fear judgment, leading them to quit the activity prematurely and deny themselves new opportunities. </li>
<li><strong>Judging Newbies Online</strong> : People often mock newcomers, particularly on the internet, yet this behavior can backfire when they themselves are novices in different contexts, perpetuating a cycle of judgment and self-consciousness. </li>
<li><strong>Positive Judgments and Self-Inadequacy</strong> : Judging someone positively, like a charming colleague, can create feelings of inadequacy in oneself, leading to a negative self-image and persistent comparison over time. </li>
<li><strong>Judging as Lawmaking</strong> : Leo describes judging as the creation of mental laws or rules that apply consistently to all future situations, affecting self-perception and emotional reactions, such as feeling guilty or ashamed when exhibiting behaviors that one has previously judged in others. </li>
<li><strong>Neurotic Reactions to Being Called Lazy</strong> : When people who have judged others as lazy are themselves labeled lazy, they may become frantic or neurotic and overcompensate by overworking, leading to burnout or strained relationships. </li>
<li><strong>Unloving Mother Example</strong> : A person who grows up with a non-affectionate mother and vows to be the most loving parent can overextend themselves, leading to self-neglect and deteriorating family dynamics due to a deep-seated rule to never be perceived as selfish. </li>
<li><strong>Inflexibility Due to Arbitrary Rules</strong> : Strict adherence to arbitrary self-imposed rules can block avenues in life, creating inflexibility and a lack of spontaneity, culminating in persistent feelings of guilt, shame, and dissatisfaction. </li>
<li><strong>Personal Insight on People-Pleasing</strong> : Leo shares a personal insight that his people-pleasing tendencies came from judging his father as inconsiderate, causing him to avoid being perceived as such in his own life and leading to long-term negative consequences. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Awareness Exercise</strong> : Leo shares an exercise to recognize deep insights: writing down every judgment made about others and oneself in a stream of consciousness to identify potential sources of self-judgment and neurotic patterns. </li>
<li><strong>Exercise Benefits</strong> : By highlighting judgments that could backfire or create neurotic patterns, individuals gain clarity on potentially damaging self-perceptions and behaviors they may subconsciously adopt. </li>
<li><strong>Demonstration of Exercise</strong> : Leo demonstrates the exercise by listing judgments about others and himself in an unfiltered stream of consciousness, showcasing the breadth and depth of potential judgments. </li>
<li><strong>Following Up on Identified Judgments</strong> : After creating the lists, individuals are encouraged to be mindful of the judgements that stand out to them, reflecting on how these may be negatively impacting their life and personal growth. </li>
<li><strong>Impact of Mindfulness on Judgment</strong> : Practicing increased awareness helps in recognizing the double-edged nature of judgments and the self-imposed limitations they create in various aspects of life, like body image, financial success, and sexuality. </li>
<li><strong>Advice on Minimizing Self-Judgment</strong> : To minimize self-judgment, Leo advises stopping the judgment of others first, as the act of judging others usually results in judging oneself. </li>
<li><strong>Support Offered Through Personal Development Resources</strong> : Leo recommends signing up for his free newsletter, asserting that consistent engagement with the exercises and resources provided will result in life-transforming personal development over time. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Persistence in Personal Development</strong> : Leo emphasizes the value of regular personal development work and staying engaged with the resources he provides to maintain growth and avoid common life setbacks.</li>
