            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/F4HV6oKJgiE' target='_blank'>What Is Actuality - Distinguish Direct Experience vs Concept</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Seriousness about abstract concepts</b>: Leo acknowledges the difficulty in grasping abstract and theoretical topics discussed on his channel and emphasizes the importance of distinguishing these concepts from the actuality they point towards.
</li><li><b>The crucial distinction between actuality and concepts</b>: Emphasizing the importance of differentiating what is actual from concepts, beliefs, and imaginations, Leo notes that many people struggle with this distinction, leading to a flawed perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Misconception regarding spirituality</b>: Contrary to the belief that spirituality is about beliefs, Leo states that genuine spirituality is about grounding oneself in actuality, not beliefs.
</li><li><b>Exercise of focusing on one's hand</b>: Through an interactive exercise, Leo directs viewers to focus on their hand and its actual existence as a means of experiencing actuality directly, distinguishing it from when the hand is out of sight and only imagined, which represents concepts and imagination.
</li><li><b>Potential misunderstandings of spirituality</b>: Leo points out that many people misconstrue spirituality as something otherworldly, whereas he defines it as the simple acknowledgment of the actuality of one's hand.
</li><li><b>Conceptual baggage and deep contextualizing</b>: He discusses how our minds provide unnecessary context to every perception, conflating actuality with mental interpretations. Spirituality aims to strip away these layers to experience reality in its rawest form.
</li><li><b>Looking at one's hand as a spiritual practice</b>: Leo describes spending hours simply observing his hand, highlighting that such a direct and simple practice is profoundly spiritual and is the essence of non–duality and enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Differentiating earth's shape and birth as concepts</b>: Leo invites viewers to recognize that understanding the earth's shape and the notion of being born are concepts and imaginations, not direct experiences.
</li><li><b>Parental concepts and enlightenment ideas</b>: Reflecting on concepts of one's parents or being born, and even established notions of enlightenment, he points out that these are not actual but rather conceptual or imaginative constructs.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding Enlightenment</b>: The idea that enlightenment could come from simply staring at one's hand is often dismissed; however, Leo stresses that this is due to a lack of depth in the practice. Only with hundreds or thousands of hours invested in such exercises, does the profundity becomes evident. 
</li><li><b>The Hand as a Subject of Deep Inquiry</b>: Through extended observation of the hand without preconceived notions, Leo promises a profound shift in context; the hand is seen not just as a hand but something more, indescribable and nameless. He emphasizes the importance of this shift for enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Contextual Reality</b>: Commonly accepted realities like being human, being born, and seeing with eyes are labeled as imaginary. Leo argues that what is truly actual, the raw sensation of the hand, exists beyond these constructs. 
</li><li><b>Existential Questions Triggered by Observation</b>: Prolonged focus on the hand leads to deeper questions like why the hand exists, what it's truly made of, and its purpose. This sense of 'realness' is essential in spiritual practices. 
</li><li><b>Contrasting Actuality with Concepts</b>: Leo contrasts the actuality of the hand with concepts such as evolution, science, logic, and evidence. He posits that direct experience of one's hand is more tangibly real than these abstract ideas. 
</li><li><b>Distinguishing Actuality from Imagination</b>: By questioning the contextual reality we assume, like the existence of the universe or the Milky Way, and focusing on the hand, Leo aims to guide towards the recognition that most of what we consider real is, in fact, imaginary. 
</li><li><b>Encountering the Fear of Insanity</b>: As one progresses in differentiating actuality from imagination, reality starts to become indefinable, which can be unsettling or even frightening. Leo indicates that this is a correct path towards awakening to the illusion of reality. 
</li><li><b>Everything Is Imaginary</b>: Leo suggests that concepts, including the ideas about consciousness being a product of brain activity or the body as a composite image, are imaginary. He leads viewers to question even their idea of the body through direct sensation, which he claims is closer to actuality. 
</li><li><b>Teachers Share Concepts, Not Actuality</b>: Leo explains all teachings, including his own, are composed of concepts and beliefs. Real learning comes when students relate these teachings to their direct experience of actuality. 
</li><li><b>Understanding God through Actuality</b>: God is synonymous with actuality, and understanding God requires acknowledgment and contemplation of actual things like one's hand. Leo equates the direct experience of the hand with the actuality of God. 
</li><li><b>Viewing the Self as God</b>: Leo faces criticism when suggesting people are God. He explains this realization stems from actuality, not arrogance, and critiques the human tendency to conceptualize themselves at the center of existence.
</li><li><b>Challenging Perceptions of Reality</b>: Encountering radical truths about actuality versus concept can be uncomfortable, but Leo implores the audience to confront these truths rather than retreating to comfort zones filled with beliefs and preconceived notions.
</li><li><b>God as a self–aware field</b>: Leo articulates that the self–awareness present in our conscious experience is what he refers to as God, challenging the standard notions of what God is.
</li><li><b>Death as a concept</b>: He emphasizes that death and non–existence are concepts within our imagination; while we may fear death, it is not an actual experience but an idea created by the mind.
</li><li><b>Non–existence vs. existence</b>: By drawing attention to the hand, Leo highlights the difference between the actuality of existence, which is tangible, and the imagined concept of non–existence.
</li><li><b>Overcoming objections with direct experience</b>: Leo confronts potential objections to his views on death as imaginary by pointing back to the direct experience of the hand, insisting that true understanding comes from what is directly observable.
</li><li><b>Truth grounded in physical reality</b>: He argues that what we typically think of as truth is actually conceptual and that real truth is found in direct physical experiences, like observing one's hand.
</li><li><b>Political and historical concepts as imagination</b>: Leo asserts that our political views and understanding of history, like pivotal events and figures, are constructions of the imagination rather than direct experiences.
</li><li><b>Fear used by the mind as extortion</b>: He suggests that fear is an imaginary tool used by our minds to keep us attached to certain beliefs and that even the fear of death is based on imaginary constructs.
</li><li><b>Direct examination of objects for spiritual practice</b>: Leo proposes a spiritual exercise that involves examining a small object with intense focus to appreciate its actuality, distinguishing this from any conceptual understanding of the object.
</li><li><b>Recognizing benefits of actual versus imagined outcomes</b>: He urges viewers to be honest about the benefits received from spiritual practices, highlighting the often–substantial gap between real and imagined benefits.
</li><li><b>Relating insights to direct experiences</b>: Each insight shared by Leo should be examined in the context of one's own direct experiences, ensuring teachings are not simply agreed with conceptually but realized practically. 
</li><li><b>Understanding 'self' and 'evil' as concepts through direct experience</b>: Leo suggests experimenting with the understanding that the 'self' is not a physical reality but a concept, and similarly, exploring the idea that 'evil' is merely a conceptual construct.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Concept</b>: Leo challenges the notion of evil, using Hitler as an example to illustrate that what we consider evil is actually a concept derived from imagination rather than a characteristic inherent in the individual or their physical representation. 
</li><li><b>Everything as Consciousness</b>: Through observation of the hand, Leo leads to the realization that all perceived objects, as well as thoughts themselves, are forms of consciousness, underlining his assertion that consciousness is the essence of all existence.
</li><li><b>Meaning as Imagination</b>: Leo posits that meaning does not inherently exist in objects like hands or tables but is instead a concept projected onto actuality by our imagination, detaching the notion of meaning from the essence of objects.
</li><li><b>Self as Imaginary Construct</b>: He emphasizes the personal discovery that the self or ego is not present in physical body parts; instead, the concept of the self emerges from one's imagination.
</li><li><b>Concept of Being God</b>: Countering the notion of arrogance, Leo suggests that recognizing oneself and everything as God is not delusional but a profound, radical realization, obscured by the ingrained belief of being a separate ego.
</li><li><b>Usurping God's Place</b>: Leo describes the process by which humans conceptually take over God's place, mistaking themselves for the ultimate reality and failing to see that everything, including themselves, is God.
</li><li><b>Role of the Devil in Self–Identity</b>: He equates the human tendency to place their ego in God's position to the devil's actions, arguing that in doing so, they create an illusion obscuring the realization that God and the devil are aspects of the same reality.
</li><li><b>Definition of Happiness</b>: Happiness is defined as the acceptance of the present moment in all its forms. Leo suggests that actual enjoyment of the present, regardless of circumstances, is the essence of true happiness.
</li><li><b>Death as Imaginary</b>: Leo asserts that the concept of death exists only as an idea in imagination, urging an examination of direct experience where the idea of death doesn't hold any real presence.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Embrace Radical Truths</b>: He encourages embracing radical and shocking truths by grounding oneself in actuality, as opposed to relying on preconceived beliefs, ideas, or imaginations.
</li><li><b>Practices for Grounding in Actuality</b>: Recommends repeatedly focusing on one's hands as an exercise to break free from the mind's conceptual traps, and offers a set of contemplative questions aimed at distinguishing the nature of concepts, beliefs, imagination, and actuality.
</li><li><b>Daily Observation Exercise</b>: Leo suggests a 15–minute daily practice of observing one's hand in silence, stripping away context and imagination to appreciate its actuality.
</li><li><b>Object Examination Practice</b>: He recommends a similar exercise using a small object like a pen or a post–it note, scrutinized for 15 minutes daily, to understand the purity of spiritual experience.
</li><li><b>Spirituality through Direct Experience</b>: Leo emphasizes that perceiving everyday objects as manifestations of God or consciousness is fundamental to authentic spirituality, more so than traditional practices.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as the Underlying Reality</b>: While engaged in these exercises, one should use the active mind to reinforce the understanding that both the hand and the object are forms of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Insights and Epiphanies</b>: Leo states that with consistent practice, one might experience profound insights, even enlightenment, leading to an appreciation of what true spirituality entails.
</li><li><b>Experimenting with Faith in the Process</b>: Leo likens these exercises to scientific experiments, requiring faith not in outcomes but in the process, to explore and discover new insights.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Resource</b>: Leo points to resources on his website like book lists, courses, forums, and exclusive blog content, which provide a deeper understanding and support for these practices.
</li><li><b>Advanced Nature of Teachings</b>: Leo underlines that Actualized.org's teachings are highly nuanced and advanced, requiring personal engagement and investigation beyond passive consumption.
</li><li><b>The Cost of Comprehension</b>: He candidly discusses the extensive effort needed, such as hours of observation, to truly grasp existential realities, which he contrasts with the passive absorption of secondhand knowledge.
</li><li><b>Critique of Traditional Education</b>: Traditional education is criticized for emphasizing rote memorization and indoctrination, rather than encouraging active investigation into reality.
</li><li><b>Call for Personal Investigation</b>: Leo asserts the importance of verifying his teachings through personal investigations, comparing them to other life pursuits for an authentic understanding of their value.
</li><li><b>Differentiating Actualized.org</b>: Concluding, Leo positions Actualized.org as a unique platform for direct investigation of actuality, far beyond religion, New Age beliefs, or even science.
