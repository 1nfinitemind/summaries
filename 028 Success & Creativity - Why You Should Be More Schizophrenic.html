            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yvRWqGpKx-s' target='_blank'>Success & Creativity - Why You Should Be More Schizophrenic</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Inner Reality's Importance in Adulthood</b>: Leo notes that adults often diminish their sense of inner reality, becoming overly reliant on external feedback to shape their inner world, while successful and creative people maintain a robust inner reality.
</li><li><b>Reevaluating Inner Versus Outer Reality</b>: The distinction between inner and outer worlds is questioned, with society placing higher value on tangible success. However, Leo argues that inner reality, encompassing beliefs, emotions, and visions, is just as vital.
</li><li><b>Creative Process Starts Internally</b>: Emphasizing that all significant achievements begin with an internal vision, Leo states that creative geniuses from Steve Jobs to artists have to believe in an inner vision before external realization.
</li><li><b>Vision's Tangibility and Struggle</b>: He points out that despite societal dismissal of vision's importance, the process of translating it to reality involves immense internal struggle and emotional labor that is often invisible to others.
</li><li><b>Developing a Strong Internal Reality</b>: Leo advises reconditioning oneself to prioritize internal reality, suggesting that it plays a foundational role in achieving success and making creative ideas manifest in reality.
</li><li><b>Mind as Original Augmented Reality</b>: Drawing an analogy with augmented reality technologies, Leo describes the mind as a filter that shapes our perception of reality, emphasizing the need to use this to our advantage for success and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Mental Fabrications</b>: He explains that what we perceive as tangible reality is often shaped by mental fabrications and the goal should be to use the mind's augmenting capacity for personal benefit.
</li><li><b>Harnessing the Power of Imagination</b>: Leo urges viewing one's imagination as a palpable, valid part of reality, which can lead to achieving one's dreams, resembling the strong inner reality of the misunderstood "schizophrenic" person.
</li><li><b>Uniqueness of Human Imagination</b>: The human mind possesses a unique ability to dream, imagine, and believe in something so intensely that it can guide our actions towards making such visions a reality. Leo points out that what we conceive in our minds can be as real as we make it, echoing the intensity with which a schizophrenic believes in their reality.
</li><li><b>Significance of Believing in Imagination</b>: Leo encourages us to take our imagination seriously, giving life to our ideas and considering our world as an augmented reality. He suggests that our internal and external realities are not separate, but rather intersect and combine, influencing our actions and outcomes.
</li><li><b>Vision as a Creative Driver</b>: The act of visualization is emphasized as powerful, serving as an internal blueprint for our goals and as a source of motivation. Leo wants us to merge our internal world with our external one, thereby starting from the power within the internal world.
</li><li><b>Practical Application</b>: Advices listeners to value their visions and not let others discount them, as these "just ideas" are potent and form the foundation of drive and motivation. One should think of the mind as a CAD program for rapid prototyping and design of desired outcomes.
</li><li><b>The Example of Nikola Tesla</b>: Nikola Tesla is highlighted as an individual who, despite mental health challenges, had exceptional visualization skills, creating and meticulously working out complex designs in his mind, which were successfully realized in the physical world.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Mental Hesitations</b>: Stresses the need for a mental shift to overcome hesitations and fully believe in the power of our inner world. Practical ways to strengthen this include spending time alone, contemplating, and focusing on thoughts, using techniques like visualization and meditation.
</li><li><b>Building a Strong Inner Reality</b>: Suggests increasing alone time to deliberate on ideas and visions in great detail. Leo shares his personal intention to incorporate more mental planning into his life, understanding the potential benefits for his business and creativity.
</li><li><b>Harnessing Creative Moments</b>: Leo recommends recognizing and extending the conditions that lead to creative moments in everyday life, suggesting habits like morning visualization or journaling to nurture a believer's mindset that motivates action throughout the day.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Journaling</b>: Journaling is heralded as a powerful practice that complements meditation and visualization, creating a tangible medium to immerse oneself in creative thought and solidify one's internal reality.
</li><li><b>Valuing Privacy and Imagination</b>: Calls for a deep regard for personal thoughts and imagination. Suggests building willpower to become a stronger visualizer and to unhook from the concern about others' opinions, embracing personal visions with the belief that they will materialize over time.
</li><li><b>Childhood Imagination as Role Model</b>: Points out how children naturally excel in using their imagination because they are free, living in the moment, and can easily immerse in their internal reality. Adults can learn from this, aiming to "direct their own movies" in their minds.
</li><li><b>Manifesting Reality Through Belief</b>: Leo emphasizes that by using the mind to filter reality through our desires, we empower ourselves to create not just our own reality, but to contribute to societal change, echoing the idea of shaping the external world through the power of belief and willpower.
