        <ul>
<li><strong>Zen Master Analogy</strong> : Leo describes his teaching style as similar to a Zen master's approach, where direct and intense techniques are used to guide students toward enlightenment, sometimes using metaphorical or literal 'smacks' to awaken them from their spiritual slumber. </li>
<li><strong>Rationale Behind Harshness</strong> : He explains that his seemingly harsh responses, whether in comments or video content, are deliberate and aimed at those who are significantly off course in their understanding or actions, believing that gentle persuasion would be ineffective in such cases. </li>
<li><strong>Varied Responses Based on Context</strong> : Leo adapts his responses to the situation. He offers patient, detailed guidance to those genuinely struggling but will be more abrasive with those who are lazy or willfully ignorant, as they may require a more forceful awakening. </li>
<li><strong>Impactful Communication</strong> : Leo struggles with ensuring the wisdom he shares is absorbed and not just intellectually understood. He emphasizes the necessity of occasionally being aggressive in his teachings to make a lasting impact on his audience. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Solid Grounding</strong> : He criticizes approaches that are overly positive without being grounded in solid principles. Leo stresses the need for clear delineation between right and wrong to avoid fostering laziness or self-destructive behavior in his students. </li>
<li><strong>Continuous Growth and Guidance</strong> : Leo discusses the ongoing nature of personal development and offers free resources to keep his audience engaged and growing, helping remind them of critical principles regularly. </li>
<li><strong>Achieving Personal Goals Through Growth</strong> : He encourages his viewers that consistent application of his teachings can lead to self-actualization, enlightenment, and success in various aspects of life. </li>
<li><strong>Learning and Adapting as a Teacher</strong> : Leo confesses that finding the balance between soft and hard teaching approaches is challenging, admitting he makes mistakes but is quick to learn from them to benefit his students.</li>
