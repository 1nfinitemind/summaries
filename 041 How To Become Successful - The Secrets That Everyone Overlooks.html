    <li><b>Six Principles of Success</b>: Leo references Arnold Schwarzenegger's six principles: trust yourself, break the rules, don't fear failure, ignore the naysayers, work hard, and give back. These serve as a foundation for success.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self–Understanding</b>: To be successful, it's critical to know oneself–your values, passions, and what you find meaningful–in order to align your work with your personal inclinations.
</li><li><b>Hard Work and Self Development</b>: Success is not just about outward achievements but also about developing oneself internally. Self–mastery, discipline, and good habits are crucial for enduring success.
</li><li><b>Choosing a Career Path and Mastery</b>: One should choose a specific career path to master over a long period, at least a decade, and fully commit to it without looking back, no matter the obstacles.
</li><li><b>Aligning Career with Passion</b>: It's essential to engage with work that resonates with your values and interests. This may require exploratory activities such as brainstorming, journaling, or strength assessments to determine one's aptitudes and interests.
</li><li><b>Evaluating Career and Lifestyle Preferences</b>: In choosing a career, it's important to also consider the lifestyle it entails–travel, financial goals, creative autonomy, work environment preferences–and what one doesn't want in a career.
</li><li><b>Value of Experimentation and Learning</b>: Gaining insights from personal experiences and others' experiences is necessary, as it allows one to refine their path, such as realizing a preference for entrepreneurship over conventional employment.
</li><li><b>Role of Self Mastery</b>: Mastering one's psychology and emotions is foundational to overcoming challenges in career progress, relationships, money management, fitness, and life success.
</li><li><b>Learning from Successful Models</b>: Studying the behaviors, mindsets, and principles of successful individuals is vital. Interacting with successful individuals and participating in personal development activities can help foster success.
</li><li><b>Value of Contribution and Providing Value</b>: To attain long–term success, one must focus on contributing positively to the world and offering more value than the compensation received.
</li><li><b>Immersion in Success Theory</b>: Continuous learning and engagement with the concepts of success is crucial to maintain momentum and direction, as success is a marathon, not a sprint.
