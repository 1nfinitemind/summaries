        <ul>
<li><strong>Six Principles of Success</strong> : Leo references Arnold Schwarzenegger's six principles: trust yourself, break the rules, don't fear failure, ignore the naysayers, work hard, and give back. These serve as a foundation for success. </li>
<li><strong>Importance of Self-Understanding</strong> : To be successful, it's critical to know oneself&mdash;your values, passions, and what you find meaningful&mdash;in order to align your work with your personal inclinations. </li>
<li><strong>Hard Work and Self Development</strong> : Success is not just about outward achievements but also about developing oneself internally. Self-mastery, discipline, and good habits are crucial for enduring success. </li>
<li><strong>Choosing a Career Path and Mastery</strong> : One should choose a specific career path to master over a long period, at least a decade, and fully commit to it without looking back, no matter the obstacles. </li>
<li><strong>Aligning Career with Passion</strong> : It's essential to engage with work that resonates with your values and interests. This may require exploratory activities such as brainstorming, journaling, or strength assessments to determine one's aptitudes and interests. </li>
<li><strong>Evaluating Career and Lifestyle Preferences</strong> : In choosing a career, it's important to also consider the lifestyle it entails&mdash;travel, financial goals, creative autonomy, work environment preferences&mdash;and what one doesn't want in a career. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Experimentation and Learning</strong> : Gaining insights from personal experiences and others&rsquo; experiences is necessary, as it allows one to refine their path, such as realizing a preference for entrepreneurship over conventional employment. </li>
<li><strong>Role of Self Mastery</strong> : Mastering one's psychology and emotions is foundational to overcoming challenges in career progress, relationships, money management, fitness, and life success. </li>
<li><strong>Learning from Successful Models</strong> : Studying the behaviors, mindsets, and principles of successful individuals is vital. Interacting with successful individuals and participating in personal development activities can help foster success. </li>
<li><strong>Value of Contribution and Providing Value</strong> : To attain long-term success, one must focus on contributing positively to the world and offering more value than the compensation received. </li>
<li><strong>Immersion in Success Theory</strong> : Continuous learning and engagement with the concepts of success is crucial to maintain momentum and direction, as success is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>
