            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/OxiiiqQyeBM' target='_blank'>Leo Hits Rock Bottom - EVERYTHING Understood</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Personal recount of profound experience</b>: Leo shares a recent profound experience of becoming deeply conscious of the ultimate nature of reality. He describes it as hitting rock bottom and gaining an understanding with many layers and facets through direct mystical experience.
</li><li><b>Metaphor of tasting honey</b>: Leo likens his growing understanding of reality to the experience of tasting honey, with previous glimpses being like a tiny lick and his latest experience akin to consuming an entire jar, providing a much fuller comprehension.
</li><li><b>Contemplation amplified by ALS</b>: He details his use of 225 micrograms of AL–LAD, an LSD analog, to intensify his contemplation and self–inquiry, which led to a breakthrough in understanding within 30 minutes of ingestion.
</li><li><b>Entering the Godhead</b>: Leo explains how he entered the 'Godhead', an infinitely dense core symbolizing eternal cosmic creation, like the heart of a white hole, leading to a deeper realization of the interconnectedness of all beings and existence.
</li><li><b>Healing experience</b>: During his experience, Leo spontaneously undergoes a moment of self–healing, which he likens to the reported healing abilities of advanced mystics.
</li><li><b>Understanding the substance of reality</b>: He realizes that the substance of reality is not physical, energetic, or even conscious, but is undefinable, intrinsically "being," and closest to nothingness–emphasizing the non–dual nature of existence.
</li><li><b>Strange loop concept</b>: Leo discusses the concept of a "strange loop," as introduced by Douglas Hofstadter, illustrating the circular nature of reality without any true reference point, challenging the human mind's grasp and encapsulating the essence of non–duality. 
</li><li><b>Experience of non–duality in the present</b>: Leo recounts the direct awareness of non–duality while simply sitting on his couch, realizing that his immediate surroundings were expressions of absolute infinity, and understanding the Buddhist and Hindu concepts of formlessness and interconnectedness.
</li><li><b>Analogy of human existence</b>: A human being is likened to a bubble in the sun, emerging and then disappearing – an event happening within nothingness, which is the true nature of our existence.
</li><li><b>Realization of identity with Buddha and Christ</b>: Leo realizes that he is simultaneously Buddha, Christ, and all mystics, as all are embodiments of the same nothingness.
</li><li><b>Infinite creativity of reality</b>: The insight that reality is an infinitely creative causal chain challenges the limitations of scientific explanation and points to an endless creativity present in all aspects of existence.
</li><li><b>Understanding life and death</b>: Leo gains an acute awareness that non–existence is impossible, negating the fear of death and understanding life and death as present experiences within this infinite reality.
</li><li><b>After–effects of the realization</b>: Post–experience, Leo retains his understanding of non–duality and observes regular daily activities as manifestations of a non–dual substance, which profoundly influences his perception.
</li><li><b>Oscillation of experiences</b>: Experiencing ups and downs post–realization is likened to the oscillation of a spring, leading to a new elevated baseline of understanding despite occasional lows.
</li><li><b>Increased creativity and struggle with meditation</b>: Leo grapples with the surge in his creativity post–enlightenment, which makes settling into a meditative state more challenging.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Stage Turquoise</b>: Leo feels he has entered Spiral Dynamics' 'turquoise' stage, characterized by a deep energetic connection to life and an understanding of its mystical nature.
</li><li><b>Continued personal flaws post–enlightenment</b>: Despite profound realizations, habitual tendencies and flaws remain, indicating the need for ongoing personal development.
</li><li><b>Personal Development Post–Enlightenment</b>: Leo recognizes he still has personal development work to do, including addressing remnants of previous Spiral Dynamics stages and emotional disturbances, highlighting that enlightenment does not make personal development obsolete.
</li><li><b>Further Transition into 'Stage Turquoise'</b>: He expresses a goal to explore the 'turquoise' stage more deeply, emphasizing the need for direct mystical experiences and insights into the absolute nature of existence.
</li><li><b>Non–Abiding Non–Dual Awareness</b>: Leo acknowledges he has not reached enlightenment as he lacks a permanent, abiding non–dual awareness, which he believes requires more meditation and being present in the moment.
</li><li><b>Balancing Creativity with Meditation</b>: Facing the challenge of reconciling his surge in creativity with the need for meditation, Leo plans extensive meditation to complement his creative endeavors.
</li><li><b>Integrating Enlightenment with Life Purpose</b>: Leo discusses the synergy between life purpose and enlightenment, asserting that both can coexist harmoniously and support each other regardless of the form the life purpose takes.
</li><li><b>Continuous Learning and Sharing Insights</b>: He plans to continue researching various topics to share knowledge that aligns with his life purpose, driven by a natural curiosity.
</li><li><b>AL–LAD as a Contemplation Tool</b>: Preferring the use of AL–LAD over 5–MeO–DMT, Leo finds it allows for deep contemplation and is productive for his insight development.
</li><li><b>Existential Questioning and Importance of Desire for Truth</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of a genuine desire to understand the substance of reality, which should not be driven by personal gain but rather for consciousness to know itself.
</li><li><b>Link between Enlightenment and Creativity</b>: He notes that deep mystical experiences can significantly boost creativity, making it more effortless and profound.
</li><li><b>Persistence in Pursuing Enlightenment</b>: Leo argues that the pursuit of enlightenment, despite its difficulties, is the most worthwhile endeavor, leading to transformative personal development uncommon in society.
