            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/QwyPdXtl0HU' target='_blank'>Deconstructing The Myth Of Science - Part 1</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Advanced and serious material</b>: Leo stresses that the content is not casual but designed for individuals deeply interested in understanding reality, and warns that it can cause an existential crisis due to the deep connections between one's sense of self and the scientific worldview.
</li><li><b>Requirement of extreme open–mindedness</b>: Listeners are encouraged to have an open mind, as the content poses a threat to established worldviews and identities, particularly those built around science.
</li><li><b>No reliance on faith or belief</b>: Leo insists that his insights must not be accepted on faith but instead validated through personal contemplation and direct experience.
</li><li><b>Focus on the limitations of science</b>: He clarifies that the series will highlight the limitations of science, not its advantages, which are already emphasized in education.
</li><li><b>Advanced contemplation material</b>: Leo has spent 15 years and over a thousand hours contemplating the nature of science, emphasizing the depth and complexity of the material.
</li><li><b>Science as a source of authority</b>: The authority science holds in society means any critique can be perceived as an attack, with Leo clarifying that his intent is to purify science from corruption and fundamental mistakes, not to undermine it.
</li><li><b>Understanding science as a cultural system</b>: Leo presents science as a cultural phenomenon, not an ideology, and distinguishes between criticism from below and above, aiming to critique from an advanced, post–rational cognitive level.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation as hostility towards science</b>: Leo refutes the idea that he hates science, clarifying that his deep love for it drives him to correct its corruptions rather than undermine its value.
</li><li><b>The distinction between types of criticism</b>: Explaining that criticism of science can be from a lower reactionary or higher evolutionary perspective, Leo encourages recognition of limitations that require new methods and deeper evaluation.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction of science</b>: Leo aims to explore the epistemic and metaphysical foundations of science, its limitations, and the possibility of transcending current scientific boundaries throughout the four–part series.
</li><li><b>Utility of Science versus its Alignment with Truth</b>: While Leo acknowledges the practical utility of science, he warns against confusing scientific utility with the attainment of truth. He clarifies that science can indeed produce false theories, and blindly following it may lead away from true understanding.
</li><li><b>Loyalty to Truth over Science</b>: He suggests prioritizing fidelity to truth rather than science, highlighting historical instances where science misrepresented reality. Correcting scientific misconceptions enables realignment with truth, preventing ideological divergence.
</li><li><b>Science's Influence on Worldview</b>: Science shapes individuals' worldview and sense–making capabilities, serving as the operating system for the human mind. Errors within science, therefore, can corrupt perception and hinder a deeper understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Science's Success and its Deceptive Nature</b>: Leo argues that the success of science can be misleading, creating an over–inflated sense of understanding reality. He asserts that the greatest deceptions mix truth with falsehood, making critical discernment difficult.
</li><li><b>Critiquing Science is Part of Its Evolution</b>: He emphasizes that critiquing and deconstructing science is essential for its evolution, contradicting the notion that science should be immune to reevaluation. True progress occurs when new paradigms are accepted rather than rejected.
</li><li><b>Differentiating 'Doing' Science from 'Understanding' Science</b>: Leo distinguishes between the act of conducting scientific work and comprehending the system of science. He points out that expertise in scientific practice doesn't imply an understanding of science's philosophical and epistemological underpinnings.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Meta–Science for Breakthroughs</b>: Meta–science, or the philosophy of science, is argued to be crucial for innovative scientific work, as it allows for out–of–the–box thinking and expansion beyond the current scientific paradigm.
</li><li><b>Clear Distinction Between Pop Culture Science and Academic Science</b>: Leo divides the conception of science into a popular myth and an academic understanding. He intends to critique both, as both can have misconceptions and biases, despite the academic view being more nuanced.
</li><li><b>Focus on Interpretations and Assumptions in Science</b>: Leo clarifies that while empirical measurements in science are generally reliable, the focus of his critique will be on the interpretations, assumptions, methodologies, and the meta–science that inform these measurements.
</li><li><b>Pop Cultural Myth of Science vs Professional Academic Understanding</b>: He introduces the distinction between the simplistic, cultural myth of science and the more complex understanding by professionals and academics, warning that both perspectives are subject to critique and potential flaw.
</li><li><b>Critique of scientism and rationalism</b>: Leo Gura criticizes the cultural dichotomy that separates the world into "scientific and rational" versus "religious and irrational." He calls this a myth that overly idealizes science, turning it into an infallible belief system defended with the same fervor as religious ideology.
</li><li><b>Cultural creation of scientists</b>: Scientists are not inherently scientific; culture inculcates scientific thinking and methodology. This intertwined relationship between culture and science forms a feedback loop where each influences and creates the other, leading to a cycle that reinforces existing scientific beliefs.
</li><li><b>Prevalence of misconceptions</b>: Gura lists numerous misconceptions about science that are believed both by the public and professionals, such as science being merely objective facts, science equating truth due to its practical success, and an oversimplified distinction between science, pseudoscience, and religion.
</li><li><b>Challenging the objectivity of science</b>: Key misconceptions include the belief that science is immune to bias, ego, and belief; the notion that it has a static, monolithic method; and the assumption that it inherently seeks truth and is eager to correct its errors. Leo suggests these are false and that science is affected by psychological, historical, and cultural forces.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions extend to renowned figures</b>: Even public intellectuals and respected figures like Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sean Carroll, Richard Dawkins, and Jordan Peterson are not immune to these misconceptions, according to Gura. He contends that many professionals do not fully understand what science is, despite their accolades.
</li><li><b>Essence of science</b>: Gura prompts the audience to question the nature of science, its validity, and how we know it is a valid methodology. He warns against the assumption that technological success is equivalent to scientific truth and reminds the audience of science's historical errors.
</li><li><b>Radical self–honesty and validation of science</b>: He concludes by asserting that neither laypeople nor professional scientists have truly validated science as a methodology. Gura argues it's impossible to do so, challenging the audience to recognize their unconscious acceptance of science without critical examination.
</li><li><b>Origins of the Scientific Method</b>: The scientific method wasn't present from the beginning of humanity. It was invented by humans who had to determine what was considered valid or invalid science. This raises the problem of how to validate the scientific method itself without begging the question since using science or reason to validate science is circular reasoning.
</li><li><b>Invention of Science and Criteria for Validation</b>: The first person to create a scientific method faced the challenge of determining what would count as valid science without any pre–existing framework. The criteria and methods they chose were not self–evident but rather influenced by culture, which complicates the idea of independent verification among different individuals or cultures.
</li><li><b>Science as the Pursuit of Knowledge</b>: Science is viewed as part of a larger pursuit – the pursuit of knowledge. If restricted too narrowly, the full potential of science is limited by excluding certain areas. A true scientist is interested in discovering everything that's true, without arbitrary boundaries.
</li><li><b>Determining Valid Ways of Pursuing Knowledge</b>: Gura presents a challenge in classifying various methods (like meditation, shamanism, logical deduction, etc.) as valid or invalid ways of pursuing knowledge. The difficulty lies in reaching a consensus on the criteria for validity.
</li><li><b>Example of Shamanism and Science</b>: The example of a shaman discovering medicinal properties of plants suggests that science is not confined to academia. This calls into question the conventional definition of what constitutes science and what is considered a scientific method.
</li><li><b>The Myth of a Monolithic Scientific Method</b>: The belief in a singular, universally agreed–upon scientific method that leads to truth is debunked. Gura argues that such a method does not and cannot exist, and many accepted scientific beliefs are cultural artifacts rather than objective truths.
</li><li><b>Science as Belief and Culture</b>: The communal belief in a shaman's knowledge within a tribe is compared to modern–day acceptance of scientific claims. Both situations rely on trust and belief rather than personal experimentation, highlighting that much of what is believed to be scientific fact is based on cultural belief systems.
</li><li><b>Shamanism and Perceptions of Science</b>: Leo discusses how tribal beliefs in medicinal flowers are accepted without question, which mirrors how laypeople accept scientific facts they haven't experimented with themselves. He points out the similarities between this and the accepted method of knowing science, challenging the distinction between tribal knowledge and scientific understanding. 
</li><li><b>Fusion of Empirical Data and Belief Systems</b>: The integration of empirical observations with spiritual or animistic beliefs by tribal cultures is analogous to how modern society, including academics, embed scientific facts within complex matrices of sense–making, showing that science is also influenced by cultural and subjective perspectives.
</li><li><b>Different Worldviews and Interpretation of Facts</b>: Leo explains that the same facts can be integrated into different worldviews across various cultures, including secular interpretations, which demonstrates the subjective nature of how empirical data is understood and points to the diverse applications and interpretations of scientific facts.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Validity of Witchcraft as Science</b>: Leo challenges the outright dismissal of practices like witchcraft as unscientific without empirical testing or understanding, highlighting the potential biases and ideological prejudices that might be influencing such judgments and advocating for a genuine test in the spirit of scientific inquiry.
</li><li><b>Confirmation Bias in Science</b>: He emphasizes the problem of confirmation bias, discussing how cultural assumptions about the validity of various methods, including the scientific method itself, remain untested and accepted based on beliefs, which could potentially lead to erroneous conclusions about what constitutes valid science.
</li><li><b>Methodological Confirmation Bias</b>: Leo illustrates the difficulties in method validation, noting that methods to acquire knowledge are numerous and it's almost impossible to determine which are valid or foolproof. He underscores that errors can be made even when using a method correctly, suggesting that validating knowledge acquisition methods is deeply challenging.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Truth and Falsehood as Non–obvious</b>: Gura insists that discerning truth from falsehood is highly non–trivial and counterintuitive, criticizing the assumption that experimentation always yields more valid knowledge than speculation or introspection, which often goes untested and is simply believed. 
</li><li><b>Aristotle's Misconception and the Value of Experimentation</b>: Through the anecdote about Aristotle's belief in the differing number of teeth in men and women, Leo argues the importance of direct experimentation and the non–obviousness of such empirical truths, promoting the idea that trial and error are core to scientific validation.
</li><li><b>Galileo's Struggle with Telescopic Data</b>: He narrates the story of Galileo's challenges with convincing his contemporaries of his telescopic discoveries, demonstrating the human mind's capacity for denial when faced with data threatening its worldview, by discrediting the methods that provide such data.
</li><li><b>Construction of Reality by the Ego Mind</b>: Leo expounds on the concept that one's perception of reality is constructed by the ego, adding that even scientific ideas are part of this subjective construction, and that everything believed to be real by the ego is perceived as objectively true, highlighting the lack of objectivity in what is considered science.
</li><li><b>Science Across Various Domains</b>: He queries the scientific nature of history, computer programming, and filmmaking, suggesting that while there are factual and empirical elements, these fields also contain speculative and subjective components, questioning the conventional boundaries of what is acknowledged as science.
</li><li><b>Inclusivity of the scientific method</b>: Despite the common notion of a singular objective scientific method, Leo Gura argues that such a method is a fantasy and does not exist. He explains that all methods, including those for map making, criminal detective work, or filmmaking, contain numerous assumptions which have never been independently tested.
</li><li><b>Relativism in selecting scientific methods</b>: Science often operates under the pretense of objectivity, but the selection of one method over another is inherently subjective. The choice to consider some methods, like using microscopes or X–rays, as valid while rejecting others, like witchcraft or map making, reflects a subjective, relativistic decision rather than an absolute one. 
</li><li><b>Scientific understanding beyond empiricism</b>: Gura challenges the concept that science can be reduced to studying material alone, exemplified by the hypothetical of blending a frog to study its cells. He stresses that this approach overlooks other aspects of the frog's existence, veiling the complex nature of science and the heavy reliance on metaphysical and epistemic assumptions.
</li><li><b>Essence of scientific method</b>: Summarizing what he considers the spirit of the scientific method, Leo emphasizes open–mindedness, empirical investigation, and starting from scratch without assumptions. The process involves letting nature reveal its workings, accepting radical truths, recognizing mistakes, and utilizing an extraordinarily broad approach that even encompasses practices like witchcraft.
</li><li><b>Science as an evolving exploration of phenomena</b>: Gura points out that science opens new domains of phenomena, thus necessitating different methods. The methodological dilemma lies in recognizing which phenomena and methods are valid. An overly narrow scientific method risks excluding whole domains of reality, leading to confirmation bias in judging what constitutes legitimate evidence.
</li><li><b>Metaphysical and methodological dilemmas in science</b>: Leo articulates the inherent circularity problem in validating the scientific method using the scientific method itself. He summarizes by emphasizing the need for open–mindedness and neutrality in scientific investigation, which are often lacking due to the biased and dogmatic metaphysics held by most scientists.
</li><li><b>Circular reasoning in science and religion</b>: Leo draws parallels between the circular logic used by religious adherents to justify their beliefs and the circular validation utilized by scientists for the scientific method. Just as a Christian may believe in the Bible's divine authorship, scientists often use the scientific method to validate the scientific method. This, Leo argues, doubles down on any unperceived errors and creates blind spots, as data that don't fit within the method could be denied–showing a lack of independent validation.
</li><li><b>Problem of demarcating science from pseudoscience</b>: Leo challenges the idea that there is a clear line distinguishing science from pseudoscience. He contends that the very criteria used to make this distinction have not been validated outside of science. This inability to externally validate these criteria means that the distinction itself is a form of begging the question, thus illustrating the problem inherent to distinguishing what counts as science.
</li><li><b>Science as a subset of philosophy</b>: He explains that science originated as 'natural philosophy' and emphasizes that science is an offshoot of philosophy, not an independent realm. This is important since science operates within the larger domain of meta–science, which precedes empirical science. Leo criticizes the misconception within the scientific community that regards philosophy as unnecessary and unscientific, pointing out the untested metaphysical and epistemological claims held unconsciously by scientists.
</li><li><b>Potential arrogance of the scientific mindset</b>: Leo critiques the scientific desire to mechanize the process of finding truth, comparing it to a meat grinder producing factual outcomes. He argues that this outlook is flawed because it overlooks the complexity of nature and ignores the necessity for the scientist's self–awareness and self–reflection. He encourages recognizing science as an intuitive process rather than an objective and mechanical one.
</li><li><b>Consequences of misunderstanding science's theoretical basis</b>: Finally, Leo emphasizes science's deep reliance on interpretation and theory, with most of it being theoretical work rather than empirical. He points out even the simplest scientific statements like "lemons are yellow" are steeped in subjective interpretation, language, and metaphysical considerations. This underscores the fact that science is not just a collection of raw facts, but a complex web of theories, conjectures, speculations, and assumptions informed by human abstraction.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of objective facts</b>: Despite common belief, facts like "the Earth is round" involve subjectivity and interpretation, highlighting that what is considered scientific fact is often deeply intertwined with human perspective, language, philosophy, and culture.
</li><li><b>Evolution as a conceptual model</b>: The concept of evolution, though widely accepted as an empirical fact, is a theoretical framework created and projected onto nature by humans to make sense of observable phenomena, which illustrates the interpretative nature of scientific understanding.
</li><li><b>Reconstructing dinosaur skeletons</b>: Dinosaur skeletons in museums are often incomplete and reconstructed from different findings, showing the degree of guesswork and interpretation involved in paleontology, which extends to speculative features like color and biology of the dinosaurs.
</li><li><b>Simplicity of the atomic model</b>: The classic atomic model with electrons orbiting a nucleus, though commonly held in the public imagination, has been debunked by quantum mechanics, showcasing how simplified models can mislead our understanding of scientific reality.
</li><li><b>The underdetermination problem</b>: Multiple theoretical models can explain a given set of data, presenting the underdetermination problem in science, where it's challenging to ascertain which model accurately represents truth, signifying that science is theory–laden and not just a collection of facts.
</li><li><b>The interconnected web of scientific ideas</b>: Scientific ideas form a web of interconnected thoughts that point to one another and only indirectly connect to empirical data at the periphery, underscoring that models and interpretations are what give meaning to data, not the data itself.
</li><li><b>Relativity and subjectivity of scientific methodology</b>: Decisions about what phenomena to study, which experiments to run, and how to categorize data are relative and subjective, affecting the outcomes and interpretations of science and demonstrating it's not just empirical data but also how we make sense of it.
</li><li><b>Categorization in science</b>: Categorization of phenomena in science, such as distinguishing between fruits and vegetables, is subjective and arbitrary, influenced by the human mind rather than inherent divisions found in nature, impacting how we understand and make sense of reality.
</li><li><b>Biases in pattern recognition</b>: Science, as a form of pattern recognition, focuses on relationships and patterns that are relevant to human survival needs, such as object permanence, highlighting the subjective biases inherent in our scientific interpretations.
</li><li><b>Quine's Web of Belief</b>: Leo Gura discusses the philosophy of W.V. Quine, who compared scientific knowledge to a field of force bounded by experience. When experience contradicts our beliefs, we adjust the periphery of our knowledge before the core, illustrating that our understanding of science is underdetermined by experience and full of subjective choices.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a Scientific Tool</b>: Leo challenges the dismissal of psychedelics as valid scientific tools, likening this to the denial of Galileo's telescope discoveries. Modern scientists might reject substances like 5–MeO–DMT without personal experimentation, mirroring historical closed–mindedness to anything outside cultural norms.
</li><li><b>The Difficulty in Epistemology</b>: Leo argues that separating truth from falsehood is an extremely challenging, costly, and risky endeavor. He claims that true science involves taking calculated risks and venturing into uncharted territories rather than reconfirming what is already known.
</li><li><b>Holistic Intelligence in Science</b>: Leo promotes a meta–scientific approach to science, emphasizing that true scientific breakthroughs require holistic intelligence, intuition, and philosophical consideration beyond mechanical or formal systems.
</li><li><b>Einstein's View on Meta–Science</b>: Quoting Einstein, Gura highlights the importance of meta–scientific thinking to achieve groundbreaking discoveries in science. True scientists who seek truth also delve into philosophy and epistemology of their field.
</li><li><b>Critical Evaluation of Methodology</b>: He criticizes the tendency to dismiss unconventional methods like psychedelics, advocating for their critical evaluation instead. The process of discovering truth is emphasized as being non–trivial and open to various methodologies beyond those conventionally accepted by science.
