        <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/YYoNpU9rY_k' target='_blank'>Announcement - Actualized.org Launching On Patreon + Vision For The Future</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Actualized.org Launching on Patreon</strong> : Leo announces Actualized.org's launch on Patreon as a means to fund its growth and improvements. The platform allows for small monthly donations to support the work he does without compromising its integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Hesitation about Monetization</strong> : Leo shares his reservations about monetizing his content, fearing it may undermine its value. He could potentially earn much more by adopting aggressive marketing strategies, but he chooses not to, aiming to maintain his work's authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Independence and Integrity</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of maintaining creative control, allowing him to produce content that is truthful and unfiltered by corporate interests. He values the ability to discuss esoteric and profound topics without relying on clickbait to draw audiences.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Business Model</strong> : Acknowledging the business aspect of Actualized.org, Leo explains that while profit isn't the main goal, financial stability is necessary to avoid going under and to continue making an impactful difference.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Money for Good</strong> : Leo views money not as a personal need, being frugal and financially comfortable, but as a resource to fund high consciousness activities. He aims to reverse the trend of wealth flowing into low consciousness ventures.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in Original Research</strong> : Highlighting his commitment to original research, Leo talks about investing time and money in new technologies, substances, and techniques to deepen the insights he shares. He foregoes producing frequent paid courses in favor of advancing his research, benefiting the content quality.</li>
<li><strong>A New Powerful Psychedelic</strong> : Leo reveals the discovery of a new psychedelic substance more potent than 5-MeO-DMT, which he intends to reveal in the future. He emphasizes this as an example of the type of groundbreaking research that Patreon support could enable him to continue.</li>
<li><strong>Expanding Spiritual Knowledge</strong> : Leo discusses his intent to explore and share emerging spiritual technologies and methods, such as dark room retreats or new meditation forms. These initiatives will contribute to the advancement of spiritual understanding and practices.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Content More Freely</strong> : With a reliable stream of donations, Leo mentions he would be less concerned about monetizing content, allowing him to release more freely and focus on quality rather than funding concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Spreading Actualized.org's Message</strong> : Leo considers using donations for advertising campaigns to attract new audiences to Actualized.org. This would help counteract the low views his in-depth content often receives due to its non-mainstream nature.</li>
<li><strong>Combatting Low Exposure of Deep Content</strong> : Leo expresses concern that the deeper and less 'clickbaity' his content becomes, the fewer people it reaches. He suggests using ads to attract an audience that might otherwise never discover his work.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Use of Donations for Ads</strong> : Leo considers using donations to run targeted ads to introduce more people to Actualized.org, seeing it as a powerful use of funding to potentially transform lives.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Polished, Well-Produced Videos</strong> : He's exploring the idea of producing high-quality videos with 3D or 2D visualizations on complex topics requiring collaboration with animators and graphic artists.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrading Production Equipment</strong> : Leo plans to invest in upgrading his camera equipment, studio set, and editing software, noting that better infrastructure could be supported by additional funding.</li>
<li><strong>Touring and Workshops as Future Possibilities</strong> : He discusses the potential of touring and conducting workshops across the country, highlighting the costs associated with travel and venue rentals.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Vision of a Retreat Center</strong> : With sufficient funding, Leo envisages building a retreat center in Hawaii, providing in-person trainings, though he acknowledges this is an ambitious and expensive long-term goal.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminating YouTube Ads</strong> : Donation support might allow Leo to remove ads from his YouTube videos, which he believes could improve the quality of his content by eliminating distractions from advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Safeguarding Against YouTube Risks</strong> : He discusses the importance of a funding cushion to protect Actualized.org against potential demonetization or de-listing by YouTube as his content becomes more radical and truthful.</li>
<li><strong>Changing Humanity's Epistemology</strong> : Leo shares his ultimate mission to shift humanity&rsquo;s understanding of knowledge, science, spirituality, and culture, outlining his plan to write books that integrate science and mysticism.</li>
<li><strong>Continued Growth and Expansion</strong> : Leo highlights that Actualized.org is only beginning its journey, promising more free content, courses, resources, and books, and invites his audience to support his vision through Patreon if they resonate with it.</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude and Invitation for Support</strong> : Finally, Leo expresses deep gratitude for his audience and the support that allows him to follow his dream, stressing that any additional support should be given freely and without obligation.</li>
