        <h1><a href='https://www.actualized.org/insights/skepticism-and-nonduality' target='_blank'>Skepticism & Nonduality</a></h1>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism in identity</strong> : Skeptics often pride themselves on their identity, seeking hard facts and avoiding superstitions. However, they may not realize that true skepticism involves questioning all aspects of reality, including the foundations of science and rationality, not just what is considered woo-woo or supernatural.</li>
<li><strong>Conflating spirituality with religion</strong> : Skeptics tend to dismiss spirituality along with religion due to their association with delusion and nonsense. This conflation leads to a misunderstanding of spirituality and non-duality, which are about deep inquiry rather than belief systems.</li>
<li><strong>Actualizing skepticism</strong> : True spirituality is the fruition of skepticism taken to its logical end, resulting in radical and comprehensive questioning. It implies doubting not only overt beliefs but the subtleties of our worldviews and assumed rationality.</li>
<li><strong>Relativity of reason</strong> : Reason is shown to be relative and culturally dependent, with the notion of rationality varying across time and cultures. Skeptics often overlook this and assume rationality is an objective yardstick for truth, which is a mistaken belief that self-identified skeptics rarely question.</li>
<li><strong>Systematic deconstruction</strong> : Leo emphasizes the importance of deconstructing all beliefs, questioning our reliance on physical reality, the workings of our brains, and even skepticism itself. This process is not just psychological but extends to the very nature of reality, challenging physical existence and the certainty of our perceptions.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of radical skepticism</strong> : Total skepticism challenges the very nature of reality, suggesting that through such deep questioning, one could even dismantle physical reality itself. This level of skepticism is not just a curious intellectual exercise, but a life-threatening pursuit, as it can make one question the existence of everything, including the self.</li>
<li><strong>Transition to spirituality</strong> : When skepticism is pushed to its absolute limits, it paradoxically becomes a spiritual endeavor. By questioning the line between reality and fantasy to the utmost degree, the skeptic might experience a collapse of physical reality, leading to a profound encounter with the absolute truth or the divine, which is revealed to be the infinite.</li>
<li><strong>The ego's deception</strong> : The mind or ego adopts skepticism as a guise to prevent true inquiry. This self-deception is evident when skeptics hold onto the identity as a defense mechanism against enlightenment. The ego co-opts skepticism to ensure survival based on constructs, not the ultimate truth.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism's historical roots and misunderstanding</strong> : Skepticism as a philosophy dates back to ancient Greece, specifically to Pyrrho of Elis. Although skepticism is intended to doubt everything, Western philosophy and society have often failed to embrace its full radical potential, holding on to constructive biases instead.</li>
<li><strong>Western philosophy's deviation from radical skepticism</strong> : Western philosophy, following the era of Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus, shifted away from complete skepticism to constructing new philosophical systems, thus deviating from the pursuit of absolute truth.</li>
<li><strong>Constructive bias in science and society</strong> : Science's inherent bias towards constructing explanations and society's focus on survival over truth-seeking promote a constructive rather than deconstructive approach, influencing the investigation of reality and often overshadowing the pursuit of ultimate truth.</li>
<li><strong>Self-interest as a barrier to enlightenment</strong> : Many avoid the extremities of skepticism and the deconstructive path to enlightenment due to a fundamental selfishness and fear of losing one's life as it is known, despite having access to all the necessary information and teachings.</li>
<li><strong>The undoubtable nature of enlightenment</strong> : Enlightenment transcends thought, perception, and experience; it can't be doubted because it's the absence of all knowledge rather than an addition to it, and represents absolute truth after the destruction of all beliefs and constructs.</li>
<li><strong>The ego's role in skepticism</strong> : The ego, likened to the devil, uses skepticism selectively to distort reality and avoid truly questioning existence. It cherry-picks evidence to suit survival rather than truth and uses skepticism as a self-deception mechanism to prevent the realization of fundamental truths.</li>
<li><strong>Leap of faith in absolute skepticism</strong> : True skepticism requires a leap of faith, a willingness to question and potentially dismantle everything one knows and loves, ultimately leading to profound realizations about the nature of existence and the reasons behind all of existence.</li>
