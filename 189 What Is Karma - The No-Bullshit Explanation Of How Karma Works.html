            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2At8kzrwdNc' target='_blank'>What Is Karma - The No-Bullshit Explanation Of How Karma Works</a></h1>
            
            <ul>
    <li><b>Karma's Eastern Origins</b>: Karma, a Sanskrit word meaning action, originates from Eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Indian yogic traditions, dating back thousands of years.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation in the West</b>: Westerners often misinterpret karma as a universal justice system, expecting external retribution for bad deeds, but this view lacks nuance.
</li><li><b>Karma's True Nature</b>: Karma is the law of cause and effect where every action has a natural consequence, not necessarily an external one, but often internal psychological or spiritual consequences.
</li><li><b>Good and Evil within Karma</b>: Within the concept of karma, 'good' is equated with selfless actions originating from a spiritual place, while 'evil' or 'bad' refers to selfish actions based on ego or identity.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Good and Evil Actions</b>: People often only recognize blatantly selfish acts as evil, but more subtle selfish acts that promote or defend one's identity are just as consequential.
</li><li><b>Selfishness as the Foundation of Karma</b>: A life filled with actions that promote or defend one's ego is inherently selfish, leading to a self–absorbed existence which in itself generates karma.
</li><li><b>Internal Consequences of Negative Actions</b>: When one acts selfishly, the true damaging consequences are felt internally, instantly affecting the doer's state of mind, leading to emotional suffering.
</li><li><b>Subtlety of Evil in Daily Life</b>: Individuals commit acts of selfishness daily, often unconsciously, which are not overtly wrong but contribute to the cycle of karma through negative internal impacts.
</li><li><b>Nature of Selfishness and Karma</b>: The individual who commits selfish acts like bank robbery is intrinsically selfish due to unconsciousness and internal misalignment. These acts are part of a broader pattern of behavior that perpetuates suffering, which is the real punishment of karma.
</li><li><b>Chain of Suffering</b>: A person's selfish actions, like robbing a bank, are not isolated incidents but stem from a deeper internal crisis of unconsciousness. These actions create a pattern of selfish behavior and emotional distress that compound over time.
</li><li><b>Internal Punishment</b>: The real consequences of evil actions are not always external like jail or fines, but rather the internal suffering such as fear, guilt, and a lack of integrity. Even without legal repercussions, emotional agony becomes their karmic retribution.
</li><li><b>Habit of Selfishness</b>: The habit of acting selfishly, once formed, tends to endure and manifest in various aspects of life, including relationships and daily decisions, leading to a turbulent and dissatisfying life.
</li><li><b>Need for Conscious Awareness</b>: Breaking the cycle of selfishness and its consequences requires conscious awareness and acceptance of one's selfish actions, which can be particularly challenging with more subtle behaviors.
</li><li><b>Everyday Acts of Evil</b>: Ordinary feelings like jealousy or subtle manipulations in relationships and societal interactions can be considered evil acts from the standpoint of karma, contributing to the cycle of self–centered suffering. 
</li><li><b>Protecting the False Identity</b>: People live predominantly in self–preservation mode, trying to enhance and protect their 'self' or identity which leads to constant fear and insecurity, as the ego is ultimately an illusory construct.
</li><li><b>Self–Created Hell</b>: The suffering and emotional turmoil experienced through relentless self–centeredness is akin to a self–created hell, characterized by negative emotions, stress, and manipulative behavior.
</li><li><b>Overwhelming Negative Emotions</b>: The focus on survival and self–protection fills life with negative emotions, such as fear and anger, which are all forms of self–afflicted punishment brought on by the attachment to and defense of the ego.
</li><li><b>Escape Through Conscious Living</b>: Awareness and the cessation of selfish thoughts and actions can transform one's life experience from self–created suffering to a state of peace and happiness, resembling the metaphorical 'heaven' or 'paradise'.
</li><li><b>Self–protection through denial</b>: People fear their hollow illusion of self will be exposed, so they protect themselves by continually adding layers to this illusion, perpetuating the cycle of suffering.
</li><li><b>Selfishness in charitable acts</b>: Actions like giving to charity can be tainted by selfish motives, such as feeling good or maintaining a reputation, reinforcing one's ego and continuing the cycle of karma.
</li><li><b>The ego and its consequences</b>: Building up the ego, even through seemingly selfless acts like charity, results in carrying an inflated sense of self into everyday interactions, breeding more conflict and suffering.
</li><li><b>Concept of Hell as self–made</b>: Western notions of Hell as a distant reality are metaphors for the mental and emotional suffering we create for ourselves through our actions and thoughts right here on earth.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness and enlightenment to combat evil</b>: Recognizing subtle manipulations and selfishness through mindfulness practices like meditation is key to breaking free from negative karmic cycles.
</li><li><b>The burden of negative self–thought</b>: Frequent negative thoughts about oneself or one's circumstances contribute to a personal hell, emphasizing the need for mindful awareness of these patterns.
</li><li><b>Heaven as a state of selflessness</b>: Heaven is attainable on earth by cultivating selflessness and achieving a state of no thought, which leads to true happiness and peace regardless of external circumstances.
</li><li><b>Awareness as a tool to change karma</b>: Becoming aware of one's actions and their motivations allows for a transformation from negative to positive karma, leading to the possibility of experiencing paradise on earth.
</li><li><b>Actuality of selfless action</b>: True spiritual action is devoid of self–centered thought; selfless action doesn't create a karmic footprint and aligns with enlightened thinking.
</li><li><b>Encouraging engagement with Actualized.org</b>: Leo stresses the importance of subscribing to Actualized.org to continuously receive guidance on mastering psychology and staying on course with self–improvement efforts.
