            <ul>
<li><strong>End-of-Day Fatigue</strong> : Leo faces significant difficulty as he reaches the end of day seven, with tiredness setting in and a struggle to maintain the momentum he initially felt. His energy wanes, and frustration builds due to a lack of results in the latter part of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Ebb and Flow of Retreat Experience</strong> : Despite starting the day with positive progress, Leo notices a pattern of fluctuating experiences during each retreat day, where a good day can suddenly turn tough, and vice versa, highlighting the non-linear nature of the retreat.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Struggle with Techniques</strong> : As the retreat continues, Leo's mental engagement begins to waver, especially with routine techniques like labeling, leading to boredom and difficulty keeping his mind from wandering.</li>
<li><strong>Recording Insights versus Continuous Practice</strong> : Leo grapples with the challenge of whether to document the insights arising during his retreat, which creates a distraction, yet feels necessary due to the volume and significance of these insights.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict of Profession and Practice</strong> : Due to his role as a teacher, Leo faces a conflict between the need for strict meditation practice and the professional requirement to document insights, noting that for non-professionals, refraining from note-taking might simplify the process.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of Techniques versus Focused Momentum</strong> : Leo reflects on the trade-off between using a variety of meditation techniques, which can prevent momentum build-up, and the potential simplicity and effectiveness of sticking to a single technique.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation Suitability and Individuality</strong> : He muses on the diversity of minds and how certain meditative techniques may be more or less suited to different individuals, suggesting that personality and cognitive style play a role in the ease or difficulty of meditation practices.</li>
<li><strong>Accepting Weaknesses in Meditation</strong> : Leo emphasizes that even those with minds less naturally inclined towards meditation should not use this as an excuse to avoid it. He suggests that it's valuable to work through personal weaknesses and go against the grain when pursuing enlightenment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Mindset and Enlightenment</strong> : Leo admits his philosophically minded nature can hinder enlightenment work, which requires undivided focus and direct experience over abstract thinking. He enjoys conceptualizing but doesn't want it to obstruct accessing deeper truths.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty in Adhering to Plans</strong> : Due to the challenges faced, Leo is uncertain he can stick to his planned sessions. He intends to focus more on abiding in emptiness and self-inquiry but acknowledges the difficulty in following through.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipating Post-Retreat Recovery</strong> : After a difficult night, Leo hopes to recover with better focus the following day. He understands the need to resist thoughts of ending the retreat and maintain effort despite weariness.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of the Retreat's Final Phase</strong> : Leo discusses the danger of complacency in the retreat's last days. He stresses the need to utilize the momentum built and warns against taking the closing stages lightly, recognizing these moments as critical for profound insights.</li>
